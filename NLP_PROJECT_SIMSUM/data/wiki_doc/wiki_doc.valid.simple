Some rants are used not to attack something , but to defend an individual , idea or organization . Rants of this type generally occur after the subject has been attacked by another individual or group . Rants are used often in situations requiring monologue . Comedians , such as Lewis Black , Adam Carolla , and Rick Mercer , use rants as a way to get their message or punch-line across to the listening audience . A rant can be used to flame members of an email group or electronic mailing list that are failing to reach a consensus on an issue .

An oxymoron is made up of two or more words that seem to be opposite to each other , or actually are opposite . For example , the words `` Wise fool '' , `` Warm freezer '' , `` Legal murder '' all have two words . In each one , the one word looks like the opposite of the other word . You can have words that look opposite , but are right . For example , a `` warm freezer '' could be right . A freezer could be warm if it was turned off or left open . The word oxymoron is an oxymoron ; ` oxy ' comes from the Greek word that means ` sharp ' , while ` moron ' comes from the Greek word that means ` dull ' . Words that really are opposite to each other , would be words that just can not be put together . For example , a `` round square '' could not happen because squares are not round . Oxymorons sometimes appear in jokes . Sometimes , the joke is just to say that a pair of words are an oxymoron . For example , a joke that says that `` honest politician '' is an oxymoron . This means that politicians are dishonest , if the word ` politician ' is opposite to ` honest ' .
The Manchester code is a binary encoding which also encodes the clock signal . This is very useful , because an external clock signal is no longer needed . A sequence of bits modulates the phase of the signal . This is a form of Phase shift keying , often shortened to PSK . Otherwise put , the information about the signal is in its signal flanks , that is when the signal changes . Manchester codes are widely used , for example for Ethernet or for RFID . To rule out ambiguities , Manchester codes use a preamble . A preamble is a fixed sequence that is known beforehand . One of the advantages of Manchester code is that the DC component of the signal carries no information . This makes it possible that standards that usually do not carry power can transmit this information . One of the drawbacks of the encoding is that it needs more bandwidth than other encodings , such as NRZ

A master recording is the first recording of a song or other sound , from which all the later copies are made . Since sound recording was first invented , master recordings ( usually called just `` masters '' ) have been made on discs , tapes , and computers . A multitrack master is an original multitrack recording , which may be worked on over time . This may have four , eight , sixteen or more tracks . Such a recording can not be played on an ordinary machine , and needs a special machine to be played or recorded . Multitrack recordings are mixed when they are finished , into a monophonic ( monaural ) , stereo , or Surround Sound recording . This is called a `` mixed master '' . Copies of the mixed master can be played on an ordinary machine . Master recordings often become valuable , especially if the recording artist is popular . Most masters are owned by record companies , but many artists and bands own their own master recordings , or are able to buy them later . Recordings are sometimes remastered , to copy them to another format , or to make them sound better . Digital recording allows for older analog recordings to be `` cleaned up '' , and preserved .

The basic definition of the word is at elastic In economics , people talk about elasticity of supply , or demand , or of price . If the price for an item with an elastic demand goes up , the demand for it will go down . For example , people will buy fewer DVDs if DVDs get more expensive . DVDs have an elastic demand .

Toxicology is the study of the negative effects of chemicals on living things . The main factor in the toxicity of a substance is the dose ( how much of the chemical has been given ) , as almost all substances can be toxic under the right conditions . Many chemicals that we call poisons are only toxic when made into different chemicals by the body . Many chemicals are made toxic in the liver by enzymes , for example paracetamol , which is a common drug . There is also some variation in liver enzymes ( caused by genetic variation ) in different people that can cause a substance to be more toxic in one person than it is in another . Some substances are also only toxic when they are with other chemicals , as one liver enzyme can cause activity in another enzyme .
29 Amphitrite is one of the biggest S-type asteroids , probably third in diameter after Eunomia and Juno , although Iris and Herculina are similar in size . It is probably not a fully solid body , since its density is too low for a solid silicate object and much lower than Eunomia or Juno . Its orbit is less eccentric and inclined than those of its bigger cousins - being indeed the most circular of any asteroid found up to that point - and as a consequence it never becomes as bright as Iris or Hebe , especially as it is much farther from the Sun than those asteroids . It can reach magnitudes of around +8.6 at a favorable opposition , but more usually is around the binocular limit of +9.5 . Amphitrite was found by Albert Marth on March 1 , 1854 . It was the only asteroid he found . It is named after Amphitrite , a sea goddess in Greek mythology . A moon is suspected based on the lightcurve data .
Random Forest is an statistical algorithm that is used to cluster points of data in functional groups . When the data set is large and\/or there are many variables it becomes difficult to cluster the data because not all variables can be taken into account , therefore the algoritm can also give a certain chance that a data point belongs in a certain group . This how the clustering takes place . In a random forest algorithm the number of trees grown ( ntree ) and the number of variables that are used at each split ( mtry ) can be chosen by hand ; the default settings are 500 trees , 71 variables .

Lamellibrachia is a genus of cold seep tube worms . These are related to giant tube worms . They live on the floor of the oceans , near cold seeps . There crude oil and methane leak out of the ocean floor . The worm forms a symbiosis with certain bacteria . These can oxidise sulfides . The worm provides the bacteria with hydrogen sulfide and oxygen . It does this by taking them up from the environment and binding them to a hemoglobin molecule . In return , the bacteria feed the worm . The worms can grow to a length of about 3 metres . They form a ` biogenic habitat ' by creating groups of hundreds or thousands of individuals . Living in these aggregations are over a hundred different species of organism , many of which are found only at these seeps . Cold seeps and hydrothermal vents are the only known communities that do not rely on photosynthesis for food and energy production . Unlike hydrothermal vents , which are short-lived environments , cold seeps leak oil and gas slowly . Likely owing to the cooler temperatures and stability , many cold seep organisms are much longer-lived than those inhabiting hydrothermal vents . These worm grow very slowly , but can reach lengths of over 10 feet ( 3 metres ) . This means individuals may live over 250 years .

Sexual conflict is a term in evolutionary biology . It occurs in a species when what benefits the females is different from what benefits the males . The word ` benefit ' here means ` what benefits the reproduction of the female 's ( or male 's ) genes . It is expressed as a difference in biological fitness . The conflict can lead to an evolutionary arms race between males and females . It has primarily been studied in animals , though it can in principle apply to any sexually reproducing organism , such as plants and fungi . In sexual reproduction there is , from the point of view of evolution , a fundamental difference of interest between males and females . This difference of interest plays out differently in different species . ; Males Their interest is to mate with a large number of completely faithful females , thus spreading their genes widely in the population . ; Females Their interest is to mate with a large number of fit males , thus producing a large number of fit and varied offspring . Some regard sexual conflict as a subset of sexual selection ( which was traditionally regarded as mutualistic ) , while others suggest it is a separate evolutionary phenomenon .

Values range from I - Instrumental to XII - Catastrophic .

Mammaliaformes ( `` mammal-like '' ) is a clade that contains the mammals and their closest extinct relatives . Living members of the clade include the monotremes ( Monotremata ) , marsupials ( Marsupialia ) and the eutherians ( Placentalia ) . Mammaliforms have highly specialized molar teeth , with cusps and flat regions for grinding food . This system is unique in present mammals , although it seems to have evolved convergently in pre-mammals more than once . Instead of having many teeth that are frequently replaced , mammals have one set of baby teeth and later one set of adult teeth which fit together precisely . This may help to grind food , and make it easier to digest . Lactation ( milk ) and fur , along with other features , also characterize the Mammaliaformes , though these traits are difficult to study in the fossil record . The fossilized remains of Castorocauda lutrasimilis are an exception to this . Alternatively ( see refs ) Class Mammalia takes place of Mammaliaformes , and includes all members of that clade .

When first settled , Carlisle belonged to Acton , Billerica , Chelmsford and Concord . Carlisle is about 8 miles south-southwest of Lowell , and 23 miles northwest of Boston . In the past decades Carilse has had a problem with drinking water . This is made by a lack of sewerage , leaving residents with few options when problems arise .

Premier is sometimes used instead of Prime Minister . But it is also the title of the leader of the government in some territories . When a colony is first allowed to elect its own government the head of the government is called the Chief Minister . As the colony gets more able to rule itself it is given more powers and the title of the Chief Minister is changed to Premier . When the colony becomes independent the Premier becomes a Prime Minister , and British government ministers lose any authority to rule the new country . The leader of the federal governments in Australia and Canada is called the prime minister , but the leader of the governments in Australian States and Canadian Provinces is called the Premier . This is because the states and provinces are not independent . A Film Premiere is the first time a movie film is shown , usually the stars and other famous guests attend to publicise the film .

A still is a tool used to clean a liquid . It does this by first boiling the liquid and turning it into a gas . This gas is then cooled , changing it back into liquid . Stills get their name from the word distillation . Distillation is the process of boiling and cooling a liquid to purify it . Stills are most often used to create alcohol , but they can also be used with any liquid . Some examples are medicines and perfumes . There are two main types of stills : pot stills and reflux stills . In a pot still , the pot ( like a large kettle ) holding the liquid is heated . The hot gas is cooled in a simple neck , or tube , and collected . Pot stills are used for making alcohol like whisky . A reflux still is much more complex . It works with a continual flow of liquid going into the boiler , and a continual flow of distilled liquid coming out . The distilled liquid can also be put through the process several times , which is why it is called a reflux still . This allows for a more pure product , and the person working the still can control the level of purity . Reflux stills are used in the chemical and petroleum industries .

The Mediterranean Ridge is a wide ridge in the floor of the Mediterranean Sea . It is next to a rough quarter circle from Calabria , south of Crete , to the southwest corner of Turkey , and from there eastwards south of Turkey , with Cyprus . From what tectonic theory says , it is caused by the African Plate subducting under the Eurasian and Anatolian plates . As the African Plate moves slowly north-northeastward , it plows up the floor of the Mediterranean , lifting it from the seabed , and then above sea level , making the island of Cyprus . If the northward movement of Africa continues , the Ridge might grow into a long and high mountain range and destroy the Mediterranean Sea .

Superparamagnetism is a form of magnetism . A superparamagnetic material has many small clusters of magnetic things in its structure , but they are not all pointed the same way , so the material is not magnetic by itself . If a magnetic field is applied to the material , then the clusters change direction to match the magnetic field and the material becomes magnetic . Superparamagnetism is like paramagnetism , except it can happen at near room temperature . It happens when materials are made up of very small parts ( 1-10 nm ) .

The orbital speed of a body , usually a planet , a natural satellite , an artificial satellite , or a multiple star , is the speed at which it orbits around the barycenter of a system , usually around a more massive body . It can be used to refer to either the mean orbital speed , the average speed as it completes an orbit , or instantaneous orbital speed , the speed at a particular point in its orbit . The orbital speed at any position in the orbit can be computed from the distance to the central body at that position , and the specific orbital energy , which is independent of position : the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the potential energy .
In cryptography , MacGuffin is a block cipher created in 1994 by Bruce Schneier and Matt Blaze at a Fast Software Encryption workshop . It was intended as a catalyst for analysis of a new cipher structure , known as Generalized Unbalanced Feistel Networks ( GUFNs ) . Schneier and Blaze based MacGuffin on DES , their main change was spliting the DES 64 bits data block into two unequal halves in the Feistel network , 48 bits of the 64-bit data block are fed through the round function , whose output is XORed with the other 16 bits of the data block . MacGuffin 's key schedule is a modified version of the encryption algorithm itself . Since MacGuffin is a Feistel network , decryption is easy ; simply run the encryption algorithm in reverse . The algorithm was experimental , intended to explore the security properties of unbalanced Feistel networks . The cryptanalysis proceeded very quickly , so quickly that the cipher was broken using differential cryptanalysis at the same workshop by Vincent Rijmen and Bart Preneel . They also tried attacking MacGuffin with different S-boxes , taken directly from DES . This version was slightly stronger . Rijmen and Preneel warn that designing an algorithm to resist only known attacks is generally not a good design principle . Schneier and Blaze recommended using 32 rounds , and specified MacGuffin with a 128-bit key .

A lever is a simple machine . It is something that can be used in a lot of ways . One way is by measuring things , or by seeing which weighs more . A lever is supported by a fulcrum which it uses to lifts weights . It is one of six simple machines . There are three types of levers : First-class , Second-class and Third-class . The earliest remaining writings regarding levers date from the 3rd century BC and were provided by Archimedes . `` Give me a place to stand , and I shall move the earth . '' is a famous quote of Archimedes who stated the correct mathematical principle of levers ( quoted by Pappus of Alexandria ) . There are three kinds of levers . The difference between them is where the fulcrum is and where the forces are . A first-class lever is a lever where the fulcrum is in between the effort and resistance ( the load ) . A second-class lever is where the resistance ( the load ) is between the effort and the fulcrum . A third-class lever is where the effort is in between the resistance ( the load ) and the fulcrum .

Susumu Tonegawa ( born 6 September 1939 ) is a Japanese scientist who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1987 . He discovered the genetic mechanism that produces antibody diversity . Although he won the Nobel Prize for his work in immunology , Tonegawa is a molecular biologist by training . In his later years , he has turned his attention to the molecular and cellular basis of memory . Tonegawa is best known for elucidating the genetic mechanism in the adaptive immune system . If each antibody was coded by one gene , it would take millions of genes to protect against any type of antigen . Instead , as Tonegawa showed in a landmark series of experiments beginning in 1976 , genetic material can rearrange itself to form the vast array of available antibodies . Antibodies have a ` variable region ' in their structure . Tonegawa compared the DNA of B cells ( a type of white blood cell ) in embryonic and adult mice . He found that genes in the mature B cells of the adult mice are moved around , recombined , and deleted to make the many versions of the variable region of antibodies .

The Concentric zone model , or Burgess model is a model to explain how a settlement , such as a city will grow . It was developed by Ernest W. Burgess between 1925 and 1929 . Burgess looked at the growth of Chicago in the late 19th and early 20th century . Many people moved to Chicago in that time . The model was the first to explain why certain groups of people lived in certain areas of the city . Burgess said that there were circles around the center of the city . The circle a piece of land was in determined how it was used . Burgess saw different zones , starting at the center : Burgess saw that wealthier people tended to live farther away from the city center .

An orphan is a child whose natural parents are absent or dead and who must be brought up in an orphanage or by foster parents . Sometimes parents get sick and die while their child or children are still young , and if no close relatives take care of them , if they can not or will not do so , they are normally raised in an orphanage . When several children , brothers or sisters are left orphaned they are normally split up ; one child going to one family or one child going to a foster family while another may stay in the orphanage . Sometimes parents may not have jobs or money and abandon their children because they can not afford to bring them up . The parents may feel that if someone else brings them up they may have a better future in the long run . In many poor countries orphans are often seen wondering about begging for money and food ; many may not be going to school . Not much organised help exists for them in poor countries . But in richer countries many organizations and institutions help the orphans and work to help parents when they are sick or very poor so they do not abandon their children . Organisations such as churches and community services assist them . Many characters of books and movies have been orphans , such as Oliver Twist , Annie , Batman , and Harry Potter .

Oxygen difluoride is the chemical compound with the formula OF2 . It has a V-shaped molecular structure like H2O , but has different properties . It is a strong oxidizer . Oxygen difluoride was first prepared in 1929 . It was made by the electrolysis of molten potassium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid . The chemicals had small amount of moisture . Nowadays , it is prepared by the reaction of fluorine with a dilute aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide . Sodium fluoride is left as a side-product : It is a very powerful oxidizing agent . This is proved by the oxidation number of +2 for the oxygen atom . This oxidising number is quite unusual . Above 200 Â C , OF2 decomposes to oxygen and fluorine . OF2 reacts with many metals . It produces oxides and fluorides . Nonmetals also react with it . Phosphorus reacts with OF2 to form PF5 and POF3 . Sulfur produces SO2 and SF4 with it . A noble gas , xenon also reacts with it . It produces XeF4 and xenon oxyfluorides . OF2 is a dangerous chemical . This is because it is highly oxidising .

The Rape of the Lock is a poem written by Alexander Pope , mocking heros and heroines . It was first published anonymously in Lintot 's Miscellany in May 1712 . The poem is sarcastically laughing at the epic world of the gods . It was based on an incident that was remembered by Pope 's friend , John Caryll . Arabella Fermor and Robert Petre were both from Catholic families at a time in England when Anglicanism was very important . Petre , lusting after Arabella , had cut a lock of her hair to keep without permission , which made the two families have a big argument . This was because in those days , cutting off a lock of the lover 's hair was scandalous and symbolized improper love . Pope , also a Catholic , wrote the poem to make the two families reconcile and be happy again . He made the character Belinda to represent Arabella in the poem . Pope 's poem mocks all the traditions of classics . Although the poem is funny at times , Pope keeps a sense that beauty is fragile , and that just because Belinda loses a lock of her hair she is very deeply hurt . Three of Uranus 's moons are named after characters from The Rape of the Lock : Belinda , Umbriel , and Ariel .

Nasal hair are small hair-like cells in the nose . Most of them can be found near the nostrils . The purpose of these hairs is to act as a filter , keeping dust and dirt out of the nasal passages . They also draw liquid mucus up from the epithelium by capillary action . In that way , they help to maintain humidity in the air passages and stop them from drying out . The hairs trap moisture as air is breathed out . The evaporation of trapped moisture on the hairs increases the humidity of air as it is breathed in . Note that nasal hair is different from the cilia found in the nose , which are part of the olfactory system . Some cultures consider nose hair coming out from the nostrils to be ugly . The increased growth of nasal cilia with age ( particularly for men ) is often a source of anxiety and embarrassment . A number of devices have been sold to trim the nose hair , including small rotary clippers and attachments for electric shavers . However , given the role of nasal cilia , many doctors recommend trimming them lightly , if at all . There is evidence that the movement in the ciliar slows down with age . This may be the reason that old people have more respiratory infections .

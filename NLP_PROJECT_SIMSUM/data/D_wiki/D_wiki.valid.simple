in physics , a standing wave – also called a stationary wave – is a wave that oscillates in one constant position.the word oscillate simply describes the vibrating movement of particles in a medium when acted upon by a wave , or the regular `` up and down '' motion shown in the animation . oppositely to a progressive ( moving ) wave , stationary waves do not transfer energy in a given direction when they oscillate.when a guitar string is plucked , for example , a stationary wave is formed . this happens because on releasing the string , two progressive waves move down the string in opposite directions . when they reach the point where the string is tied down , they can not move beyond this boundary . at the boundary , the wave is reflected and travels back in the opposite direction . the two reflected waves meet and interfere with one another . superposition occurs , the opposing directions of the reflected waves cancel out resulting in one `` stationary '' wave .

provenance , from the french `` provenir '' , `` to come from '' , refers to the history of ownership , or the position of a historical object.the term was originally used in relation to works of art . it is now used in a wide range of fields , including archaeology , paleontology , archives , manuscripts , printed books , and science and computing . the main reason to trace the provenance of an object is to get evidence of its original production or discovery . this has a special value to help authenticate objects , to prove what they are . provenance is essentially a matter of documentation.in archaeology the term provenience is used in related but a subtly different sense to `` provenance '' . archaeological researchers use `` provenience '' to refer to the three-dimensional location or find spot of an artifact or feature within an archaeological site , whereas `` provenance '' covers an object 's complete documented history . ideally , in modern excavations , the provenience or find spot is recorded ( even videoed ) with great precision , but in older cases only the general site or approximate area may be known , especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded . an object may have both a provenience ( where it was found ) and a provenance ( where it has been since it was found ) . in some cases , especially where there is an inscription , the provenance may include a history that predates its burial in the ground , as well as its history after rediscovery .
nuclear fission is a kind of nuclear reaction . it is when an atom splits apart into smaller atoms . some fission reactions give off a lot of energy , and are used in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors . nuclear fission was discovered in december 1938 by the german nuclear chemist otto hahn and his assistant fritz strassmann in berlin.an atom is the smallest particle which makes up a chemical element ( e.g . hydrogen , oxygen , magnesium ) . all atoms are very small . atoms are made of three components or particles : protons , neutrons and electrons . the protons and neutrons are clumped together in a ball called a nucleus , at the center of every atom . the electrons orbit around the nucleus in its 'electron cloud ' . elements which have large nuclei , such as uranium and plutonium , can be made to fission.if a ( relatively ) very large atomic nucleus is hit by a slow-moving neutron , it will sometimes become unstable and break into two nuclei . when the nucleus breaks apart ( or fissions ) it releases energy , mostly as gamma rays and heat . it also causes some neutrons to be released from the nucleus.for a few isotopes ( an atom with the same amount of protons but a different amount of neutrons ) such fission can release many neutrons . if those neutrons then hit other atoms , they will make the other atoms split . this can happen again and again . this is called a nuclear chain-reaction , and it can release huge amounts of energy very quickly . the amount of energy released by a nuclear chain reaction is measured in kilotons . one kiloton is the same as the energy of one thousand tons of tnt ( trinitrotoluene ) .in a nuclear bomb , this must happen very quickly to make a very big explosion . in a nuclear reactor this must happen slowly to make heat . the heat is used to boil water into steam , which turns a steam turbine to generate electricity .

orbital resonance is a resonance of two orbiting bodies exerting a regular , periodic gravitational effect on each other . their orbital periods may be related by a ratio of two small integers . it is caused by the changing gravitational forces of bodies which go round each other . the stability of the solar system was first investigated by laplace , and there is still much that is not known about it.as a satellite goes round a planet or two stars go round each other , the gravitaional forces can change , sometimes hugely . this is partly because orbits are usually ellipses , not circular , and so the forces change accordingly . also , the planets and stars are usually not spherical . they spin , and vary in their degree of oblateness . this also changes the forces on an orbiting body.in particular , the forces may be unstable , so the smaller partner may change until the forces are stable ( do not change with time ) . satellites often end up with one face towards their planet , because that is the most stable position ( tidal locking ) .there are other stability effects . gaps in saturn 's rings are caused by the particles shifting into more stable positions . in the rings of saturn , the cassini division is a gap between the inner b ring and the outer a ring . it was cleared by a 2:1 resonance with the moon mimas . jupiter makes similar kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt.there is a stability ratio for neptune and pluto : the 2:3 ratio means pluto completes two orbits in the time it takes neptune to complete three.the area of mechanics which is used for these studies is called celestial mechanics .

a vertical-lift bridge or lift bridge is a type of movable bridge in which a span rises vertically while remaining parallel with the road surface.the vertical lift offers several benefits over other movable bridges such as the bascule and swing-span bridge . they are generally easier to design and easier to build . they usually cost less to build for longer moveable spans . the counterweights in a vertical lift bridges are only required to be equal to the weight of the deck . bascule bridge counterweights must weigh several times as much as the span being lifted . as a result , heavier materials can be used in the deck , and so this type of bridge is especially suited for heavy railroad use.although most vertical-lift bridges use towers , each with counterweights . some use hydraulic jacks located below the deck . an example is the span bridge at st paul avenue in milwaukee , wisconsin , usa . another design used balance beams to lift the deck with pivoting bascules located on the top of the lift towers . an example of this kind is the la salle street bridge in chicago , illinois , usa.the biggest disadvantage to the vertical-lift bridge is the height restriction for ships passing under it . this is a result of the deck remaining suspended above the water .

muon-catalyzed fusion ( μcf ) is a type of cold nuclear fusion , which means that nuclear fusion can happen at low temperatures and under normal pressure . there need to be 3 particles : a muon , a positively charged triton and a positively charged deuteron . the muon , which has a greater mass ( when its not moving ) than an electron , drags the heavier triton and the deuteron to it , creating something called a muonic heavy hydrogen ion . this means that the particle is a hydrogen atom with more protons then electrons , that contains a muon , and that contains extra neutrons which make it heavier . this reaction can be done at room temperature or below , such as -270 degrees celsius.to create these , a stream of negative muons is sent onto blocks of protium , deuterium and tritium ( 3 first isotopes of hydrogen ) . the muon bumps out the electron in the hydrogen atom . because the electron is replaced , any 2 atoms are bound together . this makes a molecular ion , also called a special muonic molecule . a muon is 207 times more massive then an electron . because of the difference in mass , the atom changes . because it is heavier , the atoms in the molecular ion are pressed very tightly together , and then the nuclei , the centers of the atoms , join together . the following process is called nuclear fusion . the 2 nuclei join together and `` glue '' together . but , their weights do not just add up , a part of their mass is released as energy . this is the energy used.now , the process continues because the muon is thrown out of the nuclei when they fuse , so it can join other nuclei , which continues the reaction . sometimes the muon is attached to something else thrown out from the nucleus , and the muon is lost . this stops the reaction.the good thing about this is that muon-catalyzed fusion uses little energy , and produces much energy . the only problem is that the reaction is not stable , so it does not last a long time , because the muons are lost . this process is still a long way from being used for business .

bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells.conjugation is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer , as are transformation and transduction , though these two other mechanisms do not involve cell-to-cell contact.bacterial conjugation was discovered by nobel prize winners joshua lederberg and edward tatum . they showed that the bacterium `` escherichia coli '' entered a sexual phase during which it could share genetic information.bacterial conjugation is often incorrectly regarded as the equivalent of sexual reproduction , since it involves the exchange of genetic material . during conjugation the `` donor '' cell provides a conjugative or mobilizable genetic element that is most often a plasmid or transposon . most conjugative plasmids have systems ensuring that the `` recipient '' cell does not already contain a similar element.the genetic information transferred is often beneficial to the recipient . benefits may include antibiotic resistance , xenobiotic tolerance or the ability to use new metabolites . such beneficial plasmids may be considered bacterial endosymbionts . other elements , however , may be viewed as bacterial parasites and conjugation as a mechanism evolved by them to allow for their spread .

bernoulli 's principle is an idea of fluid dynamics . it says that as speed of the fluid increases , pressure decreases . the photo on the right shows this happening . the air in the wide part of the tube has a higher static pressure than the thin part . for a steady flow , the amount of fluid entering the pipe must equal the amount leaving the pipe , so the fluid speed in the thin part must increase.when a force acts over an area , it is called `` pressure '' . a higher pressure pushes ( accelerates ) fluid toward lower pressure . so any change in a fluid 's speed must be matched by a change in pressure ( force ) . bernoulli saw that while the fluid moved more quickly in the smaller part of the tube , the pressure became less . please note that this refers to changes in speed and pressure along a single path of flow and does not apply to two different flows at different speeds.the full version of bernoulli 's principle includes both the work by the pressure and by the changes in potential energy from changes in height . in this form , the principle says the total of the pressure , kinetic energy , and potential energy is a constant . ( bernoulli does not consider viscosity or compressibility . )

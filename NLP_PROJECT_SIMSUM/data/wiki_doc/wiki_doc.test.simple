In psychiatry the term thought disorder or formal though disorder refers to a condition where people have problems with language . The people who have this condition use language that is disordered , or hard to follow . According to the psychiatrists , language is a reflection of thought processes . People who have difficulty speaking therefore often also have difficulty thinking . Thought disorder is considered to be a symptom of psychotic mental illness , but there can also be other causes for it . The condition it describes is permanent . It affects speech and writing . Those affected may speak all the time , or they may show patterns like switching ideas inside a sentence . They may also use different words that do not fit together at all ; this is known as word salad . Eugen Bleuler , who named schizophrenia , held that its defining characteristic was a disorder of the thinking process . However , although the delusions and hallucinations of psychosis could also be considered as disorders of thought , the term formal thought disorder applies specifically to the presumed disruption in the flow of conscious verbal thought that is inferred from spoken language . This is typically what is referred to when the strictly less accurate , more commonly used but abbreviated term , ` thought disorder ' , is used .

Popularity is the act of being well-liked or common . Popularity figures are an important part of many people 's personal value systems , and forms a critical part of success in fields such as Management , politics , Entertainment Industry among others . Many different virarities of popularity exist , and many ways in which to gain it . General popularity usually involves respect in two ways : a popular person is respected by groups of people and will take that respect , thus reinforces relief of deserving the popularity . Likewise , amicability is an important part of popularity , as a person who does not like others is unlikely to be liked by others . This inverse nature of interpersonal popularity is often overlooked by people ( particularly the young ) who are attempting to become popular : being loud may be successful in gaining attention , but is unlikely to provide mutual respect .

Negative feedback is a basic concept of cybernetics ; it is the basis of regulation and control . It is important in engineering and physiology . In biology and physiology negative feedback is known as homeostasis . Negative feedback occurs when the output of a system acts to oppose changes to the input of a system . This has the result that the changes are made less , and the system kept within limits . The classic example is a central heating system which cuts off when a ( suitably placed ) temperature sensor hits a pre-set mark . The negative feedback part is the thermostat . Virtually all aspect of living systems involve homeostasis , and disease follows when any of these systems fail . Examples : blood pressure , glucose level , liver functions , cell division , and so on . Homeostasis was defined by Claude Bernard and later by Walter Bradford Cannon in 1926 , 1929 and 1932 is the property of a system , either open or closed , that regulates its internal environment and tends to maintain a stable , constant condition . The concept came from that of milieu interieur which was created by Claude Bernard and published in 1865 . If the overall feedback of the system is negative , then the system will tend to be stable .

A hat-trick , hat trick or hattrick in sports means that something is done 3 times . For example : goals , wickets and so forth . There are different interpretations as to when a hat-trick is a valid one . The most common criteria is when a player has scored 3 goals in a match . Goals from penalty shootouts are not included . A `` flawless '' or `` German '' hattrick is close to the hat-trick described above but is different since the 3 goals have to be scored within a certain period of time . Another example is the `` classic '' or `` perfect '' hat-trick which means that the player scored one goal with each foot ( 1 goal with the right-foot and one goal with the left-foot ) and an header . Occasionally Germans would award the hatrickees with 3 medals to signify their loss .
In logic , the truth value of a logical statement says how much it is true . Usually , the truth value can only be `` true '' or `` false '' . For example , `` The car is red '' is true when the car is red and false when it is not . In multi-valued logics , the truth value can be other values as well . For example , one could use a value between 0 and 1 to say how much it is true . Zero would mean that it is completely false and one would mean that is completely true . When the car is orange ( half red , half yellow ) , the truth value could be 0.5 because the statement is half true and half false .

In music , portamento is a gradual slide from one note to another . It is very similar to a glissando , but a glissando is deliberately written in the music by the composer and may be a long slide between two or three octaves or more . A portamento is a much shorter slide , usually between two notes which are quite close . Opera singers often used to slide from one note of a tune to another instead of singing each note separately and clearly . The habit of putting in portamento between notes spread to other instruments as well . When listening to recordings of violin playing from the early 20th century we can hear that the players used a lot of portamento . Over the last half century portamento has gone out of fashion and singers and instrumentalists are taught not to slide from one note to another . However , there are some places , especially in opera , where it can be effective so long as it is not done all the time . It is a matter of taste .

Musica ficta is a term used in medieval and Renaissance music . It means that when musicians play or sing music they put in accidentals ( sharps and flats ) which are not written in the music . In those days ( near the end of the 16th century ) music used modes instead of the modern system of major and minor keys . Sometimes the music would not sound right unless a note was sharpened or flattened ( raised or lowered a semitone ) . For example , to go down from the note B to an F would have sounded bad , so the F would need to be an F sharp . The composer who wrote the music down might not bother to put the sign for F sharp . He would expect the performer to know that it should be an F sharp and not an F. This is what is called musica ficta . Gradually it became more and more necessary for composers to write exactly what notes they wanted . The modern system of keys was developing . They developed the system of key signatures and accidentals ( sharps and flats which are not in the key signature , but written as and when they are needed ) . The practice of musica ficta gradually ended .

A flagellum ( plural : flagella ) is a long , whip-like projection of a cell composed of microtubules . They help propel cells and organisms in a whip-like motion . The flagellum of eukaryotes usually moves with an â Sâ motion , and is surrounded by cell membrane . Flagella are structurally almost identical with the much smaller Cilia . So much so that it has been proposed protists bearing either should be unified in the Phylum Undulipodia . Previously , Margulis had proposed that the Ciliates alone should be placed in a Phylum Ciliophora . Admittedly , the Protista is a collection of disparate single-celled forms , but while a more sophisticated taxonomy is in flux ( changing ) , Protista is still a useful term . Cilia and flagella are cell organelles , specialised units which carry out well-defined functions , like mitochondria and plastids . It is fairly clear now that all or most of these organelles have their origin in once-independent prokaryotes ( bacteria or archaea ) , and that the eukaryote cell is a ` community of micro-organisms ' working together in ' a marriage of convenience ' . Three types of flagella have so far been distinguished ; bacterial , archaeal and eukaryotic . The main differences among these three types are summarized below :

A liturgy is a ceremony , according to the traditions of a particular group or event . In religion , it may mean an elaborate formal ritual ( such as the Catholic Mass ) , or a daily activity such as the Muslim Salats . Anglican , Orthodox , Lutheran , or other groups , when using the words `` the Liturgy '' , normally mean a standardized order of events observed during a religious service , often including the Eucharist . The open or waiting worship of Quakers is an example of a non-liturgical service because there is no minister or structured order of events . In the Christian church , liturgical churches are those that use a well-defined liturgy dating to the second century and earlier , in which many of the words and music used follow basic patterns each time the service is conducted . Most Orthodox , Catholic , Anglican , and Lutheran churches are liturgical , most other churches to a far lesser extent . So-called non-liturgical churches usually follow a common worship sequence from one service to the next , with several elements common to many such services . These elements often include readings from the Bible , hymns , a sermon , offerings of money , and at certain times , Holy Communion .

Polar moment of inertia is a measure of an object 's ability to resist torsion . It is required to calculate the twist of an object subjected to a torque . It is analogous to the area moment of inertia , which characterizes an object 's ability to resist bending and is required to calculate displacement . The larger the polar moment of inertia , the less the beam will twist , when subjected to a given torque . The polar moment of inertia must not be confused with the moment of inertia , which characterizes an object 's angular acceleration due to a torque . See also moment ( physics ) .

I , II , and III Meqabyan ( Ge ` ez : á á á á `` á , sometimes spelled Makabian ) are three books in the Ethiopian Orthodox Old Testament Biblical canon . These books are very different in content from the books of Maccabees in Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Bibles , but they are sometimes called Ethiopic Maccabees or Ethiopian Maccabees . The `` Maccabees '' described in these books are not those of the Hasmonean dynasty , and the `` Five Holy Maccabean Martyrs '' here do not match `` Woman with seven sons '' , who were also called `` Maccabees '' and are revered throughout Orthodoxy as the `` Holy Maccabean Martyrs '' . These books were only written in Ethiopic for a long time , but have recently been translated into English . The historical Maccabees are referred to again in Chapter 15 , which describes the three brothers Judas , Meqabis ( Simon Maccabaeus ) and Mebikyas ( Jonathan Maccabee ) as leading a successful overthrowing against the evil king Akrandis of Midian , who was oppressing Israel . Here , Mebikyas enters Akrandis ' camp and cuts his head off at his dinnertable , food still in his mouth , while Judas and Meqabis defeat the king 's armies in the field .

Pelycosaur ( meaning `` basin lizards '' ) were the earliest synapsids . They were not dinosaurs or reptiles . These tetrapods appeared during the Pennsylvanian and went extinct during the Permian period . They were the dominant land animals for some 40 million years , and were almost wiped out by the P\/Tr extinction event . A few survived until the lower Triassic to form the therapsids , a group which led to the mammals . Pelycosaur fossils have been found mainly in Europe and North America , although some small , late-surviving forms are known from Russia and South Africa . At least two pelycosaur clades independently evolved a tall sail , consisting of elongated vertebral spines : the edaphosaurids and the sphenacodontids . In life , this would have been covered by skin , and possibly functioned as a thermoregulatory device and\/or a mating display . Unlike lepidosaurian reptiles , pelycosaurs lacked epidermal scales . Fossil evidence from some ophiacodonts shows that parts of the skin was naked , but that the belly was covered in dermal scutes . These scutes looked like the scutes present in reptile groups , but they are of a different type of structure . In 1940 the group was reviewed in detail and every species known at the time described ( and many illustrated ) in an important monograph . Well-known pelycosaurs include the genera Dimetrodon , Sphenacodon , Edaphosaurus , and Ophiacodon .

An open proxy is a proxy server which any Internet user can use . Generally , a proxy server allows users within a network group to store and forward Internet services such as DNS or web pages , so that not as much bandwidth is used and it is more controlled . With an `` open '' proxy , however , any user on the Internet is able to use this forwarding service . By using some open proxies ( `` anonymous '' open proxies ) , users can hide their true IP address . Sometimes people will abuse open proxies , and so they are often seen as a problem . Anonymous open proxies will also make the user more anonymous and secure when browsing the web or using other internet services : a user 's true IP address can be used by a hacker to get information from the user 's computer .

Mafic minerals are usually dark in color and have a specific gravity greater than 3 . Common rock-forming mafic minerals include olivine , pyroxene , amphibole , biotite and other micas , augite and the calcium-rich plagioclase feldspars . Common mafic rocks include basalt and gabbro . In terms of chemistry , mafic rocks are on the other side of the rock spectrum from the so-called felsic rocks . The term roughly corresponds to the older basic rock class . Mafic lava , before cooling , has a lower viscosity than felsic lava due to its lower silica content . Water and other volatiles can more easily and gradually escape from mafic lava , so eruptions of volcanoes made of mafic lavas are less explosively violent than felsic lava eruptions . Most mafic lava volcanoes are oceanic volcanoes , like Hawaii .

Raster graphics ( or bitmap graphics ) is one of two kinds of computer graphics . With raster graphics , images are modeled as big collections of pixels . Usually they form an image shaped like a rectangle . Each pixel holds something , like color or transparency . Raster images are used very often . Computer screens are made of a raster of points . Vector graphic images are rasterised that way . Images that are difficult to make as a vector , like photographs , are often made in the form of a raster image . Many printers today use computer languages like Postscript or PCL . These languages are based on vectorized images , most of the time . To be printed , these images need to be translated into raster graphics first . This is done by a part called a Raster Image Processor . Most modern printers have those processors inside the printer . Some printers use a special piece of software on the computer to do that job .

The nasal cavity is divided into a right and left passageway . The tissue that covers the wall of your nasal cavity contains many blood vessels . Heat from the blood in the vessels helps warm the air as you breath . Moisture is added to the air you breath by special cells in the walls of the nasal cavity . The air is warmed and moistened before it reaches your lungs . Cilia ( small hairs ) and mucus along the inside wall of the nasal cavity trap and remove dust and germs from the air as it flows through the nasal cavity . The cilia move the mucus down the nasal cavity to the pharynx , where it can be swallowed . The nasal cavity is covered by the nasal bone above and by the maxilla and ethmoid bone on the sides . The top of the inside of the mouth separates the nasal cavity from the mouth . The nasal cavity is divided in two by a vertical fin called the nasal septum . On the sides of the nasal cavity are three horizontal outgrowths called turbinates . These turbinates guide the air through the nasal cavity . The vomeronasal organ is found at the back of the septum and has a role in finding pheromones . Diseases of the nasal cavity include viral infections and nasal cavity cancer . Picking your nose can lead to bloody noses as well .

The Shapiro time delay is a physics experiment . It is one of the four classic solar system observations or experiments which test general relativity . Radar signals passing near a massive object take slightly longer to travel to a target and longer to return than it would if the mass of the object were not present . The time delay effect was first noticed in 1964 , by Irwin I. Shapiro . Shapiro proposed an observational test of his prediction : bounce radar beams off the surface of Venus and Mercury , and measure the round trip travel time . When the Earth , Sun , and Venus are most favorably aligned , Shapiro showed that the expected time delay , due to the presence of the Sun , of a radar signal traveling from the Earth to Venus and back , would be about 200 microseconds , well within the limitations of 1960s era technology . The first tests , performed in 1966 and 1967 using the MIT Haystack radar antenna , were successful , matching the predicted amount of time delay . The experiments have been repeated many times since then , with increasing accuracy .

Silent barter is what is done when traders who can not speak each other people language can trade without talking . This was used in many parts of ancient Africa . Silent bartering was mainly used during 500 A.D to 1500 A.D. To do a silent barter , one group of traders would go to a certain location , leaving whatever they are offering to trade . The other group of traders would then decide if they would like to accept the goods ( usually salt or gold ) that were left . If the goods met with approval , the second group would then take the goods , leave their own goods in return , and leave because the person accepted the offer . This system of trading was used mostly in Ancient Ghana .

Common protocols used to do this are the DAYTIME protocol and the Network Time Protocol ( NTP ) . NTP calls the quality of a time server its stratum . Stratum can be anything form 0 to 255 and lower is better . It is rare to see a network with a source worse than stratum 5 . Every level you add of time servers getting information from a source close to the master clock and passing it farther away from the master clock increases the stratum level .

When there is a war or some other armed conflict in a country , many people will try to flee ( run away ) from that country . They will go to other countries , around the country where there is no war . Because they fled , they are called refugees . If there are just a few refugees coming into a country it is generally no problem to get housing for them somewhere . However , if there are many ( or if the government of a country expects many ) refugees , it may build what is called a refugee camp . This is usually done by putting many tents , and a few toilets and showers on an unused plot ( stretch ) of land . This is usually land where no one wants to live . Usually the governments hope that conflicts get resolved soon , and that those camps are only temporary . This has not been the case for the refugee camps in the Gaza Strip , for example . Those camps have existed since the mid 1970s .

Thyroid nodules are diagnosed by ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration ( USG\/FNA ) or frequently by thyroidectomy ( surgical removal and subsequent pathological examination ) . As the thyroid cancer can uptake iodine , radioactive iodine is a commonly used modality in thyroid carcinomas . However , it is followed by TSH suppression by Thyroxine therapy .
Quantum fluctuations are small variances in matter due to Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle . This states that the more we know about where a particle is , the less we know about where it is going . Basically , small amounts of energy may change , and this is accepted in the scientific community . Quantum fluctuations can result in theoretical photons being created from nothing . These photons have no actual energy value . Like all photons , these theoretical photons can split into an electron and a positron . However , normal photons must interact with matter for this to occur , whereas theoretical photons do not . Like normal matter and antimatter , this theoretical electron and positron annihilate each other . Unlike normal matter , however , they do not create any energy when they annihilate each other , but instead create an imaginary photon .

When including spoilers , editors should make sure that an encyclopedic purpose is being served .

A lay clerk , also known as a lay vicar , is a term used in the United Kingdom to describe a male singer who sings in a cathedral choir or a choir belonging to a college of one of the large traditional universities . A lay clerk is usually paid for the job . When he is called `` lay vicar '' the term `` vicar '' comes from the Latin word `` vice '' ( meaning `` deputy '' ) .

Strange quarks are the third lightest quarks , which are subatomic particles that are so small , they are believed to not be able to be divided . Like down quarks , strange quarks have a charge of -1 \/ 3 . Like all fermions ( which are particles that can not exist in the same place at the same time ) , strange quarks have a spin of 1\/2 . What makes strange quarks different from down quarksâ `` apart from having 25 times the mass of down quarksâ `` is that they have something that scientists call `` strangeness . '' Strangeness is basically a resistance to decay against strong force and electromagnetism . This means that any particle that contains a strange quark can not decay due to strong force ( or electromagnetism ) , but instead with the much slower weak force . Strange quarks can be found in particles such as kaons and some hyperons . Scientists began noticing strangeness when these particles did not decay as quickly as their masses would have suggested they would have . However , it took them a long time to even guess strangeness was the answer because it took over 16 years to predict it after the discovery of kaons .

Mothballs are small balls of chemical pesticide and deodorant . They are used when clothing and other articles susceptible to damage from mold or moth larvae are stored . Older mothballs were made primarily of naphthalene . Because naphthalene can catch fire easily , modern mothballs use 1,4-dichlorobenzene instead . Both of these ingredients have a strong , pungent smell often associated strongly with mothballs . Camphor , an insect repellent , can also be used in mothballs . Their use when clothing is stored out-of-season led to the colloquial usage of the terms mothballed and put into mothballs to refer to anything which is put into storage or whose operation is suspended . Some claim that the use of the word in this sense derives from naval usage . When warships were laid up , the open ends of their gun barrels and other openings were covered in white material to prevent the entry of water . These white circles suggested mothballs .

The Danes were pioneers in developing commercial wind power during the 1970 â s and today almost half of the wind turbines around the world are produced by Danish manufacturers such as Vestas . Wind power in Denmark provided 18 % of the electricity produced in Denmark in 2005 , and cumulative installed capacity over recent years is shown in the Table below . However most of the wind power is exported abroad . The correlation between wind power and electricity export is very strong . Wind turbines are popular with people in Denmark .

The Shyok River is a river flowing through Ladakh and the disputed Northern Areas of Pakistan ( Ghanche District ) . Shyok river ( a tributary of the Indus ) originates from the Rimo glacier , one of the tongues of Siachen Glacier and becomes very wide at the confluence with the Nubra River ( a tributary of Shyok , originating from Siachen Glacier ) . The alignment of the Shyok river is very unusual , originating from the Rimo glacier it flows in a SE direction and at joining the Pangong range it takes a NW turn and flows parallel to its previous path . The Shyok flowing in a wide valley suddenly enters a narrow gorge after Chalunka and then joins the Indus at Skardu ( Pakistan ) . The Nubra river originating from the Siachen glacier also behaves like the Shyok , before Tirit the SE flowing river takes a NW turn on meeting the river Shyok . The similarity in the courses of these two important rivers probably indicates a series of palaeo fault lines trending NW-SE in delimiting the upper courses of the rivers . The importance of the Indus River and the Shyok rivers is in the deposition of a huge thickness of Quaternary sediments a treasure trove for geology researchers .

Software Versioning is a way to tell the different states of Computer software apart . Computer software has different states in its development process . Each state in the process is given a unique Version . Versions are either names , dates , or they can be done as some other form of numbering . Sometimes these states are also called revisions . Many times , after a program has been made , things called patches can be downloaded from the program 's website . The patches will make small changes or fixes to the main program . When a patch is used , the program is advanced to the next version . For example , a computer game is first at version 1.0 when it is released . Later , the player may download a patch , which changes the game to version 1.1 , 1.01 , or something similar to that .

This page lists direct English translations of common Latin phrases , such as veni vidi vici and et cetera . Some of the phrases are themselves translations of Greek phrases , as Greek rhetoric and literature were highly regarded in ancient Rome when Latin rhetoric and literature were still maturing . Be aware that the Latin letter i can be used as either a vowel or a consonant . When used as a consonant , it is often replaced by the letter j , which was originally simply an orthographic `` long i '' that was used in initial positions and when it occurred between two other vowels . This medieval convention is most commonly preserved in Latin legal terminology -- hence phrases like de iure are often spelled de jure . On this list , the more common form will be the one a phrase is listed under : thus , de jure is used instead of de iure , and alea iacta est instead of alea jacta est .

B major or B-flat major is a major scale starting on B-flat . Its key signature has two flats . Its relative minor is G minor , and its parallel minor is ( ( B-flat minor B minor ) ) . B-flat major is a good key for most wind instruments , especially those for which it is their home key , such as clarinets , trumpets , saxophones , and the flutes in B-flat . Haydn 's Symphony No. 98 , which had both trumpet and timpani , is known as the first symphony that anyone had written in that key . Actually , his brother Michael Haydn had written one earlier . However , Joseph Haydn still gets credit for writing the timpani part at actual pitch with an F major key signature ( instead of transposing with a C major key signature ) , something that made things easier and made more sense . Five of Mozart 's piano concerti are in B-flat major .

Conceived by Oliver Bulleid for the Southern Railway 's Dartford commuter route , the two 4DD electric multiple units were the only double-deck trains to run on the main line railway network in Britain . The upper-level seats were squeezed in between the lower-level seats to ensure that the overall height of the unit was within the clearances necessary to pass through tunnels and under bridges . The 4DD was somewhat unsuccessful because the upper level compartments were cramped and poorly ventilated ( the upper level windows could not be opened due to tight clearance ) . The compartments were pressure-ventilated but the equipment proved to be troublesome . Also dwell times at stations were increased because of the increased number of passengers per door . To obtain the extra seating capacity that was being sought , it was instead decided to lengthen trains from eight cars to ten .

The Sooty Barbthroat ( Threnetes niger ) is a species of hummingbird . It is found in French Guiana and far north-eastern Brazil . Its habitat is humid tropical lowland forest . Though normally restricted in range , it is common enough to be thought a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN . The taxonomy and systematics of the Sooty Barbthroat complex has made much confusion . Some authors thought the Sooty Barbthroat to be a `` melanistic variant '' of the Pale-tailed Barbthroat ( T. leucurus ) . Not only that , but some suggest that the Bronze-tailed Barbthroat ( T. n. loehkeni ) should also be thought a valid species and have the doubtful Christina 's Barbthroat ( T. n. christinae ) as a subspecies . Freire 's Sooty Barbthroat ( T. n. freirei ) is average between the Sooty and Bronze-tailed Barbthroats however , and thus its status needs to be more clear before the problem is fixed .

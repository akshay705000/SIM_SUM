also Adelaide of Normandy sister of William I of England . Adela of Normandy also known as Adela of Blois and Adela of England and also Adela , Princess of The English ( c. 1062 or 1067 -- 8 March 1137 ? ) was , by marriage , Countess of Blois , Chartres , and Meaux . She was a daughter of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders . She was also the mother of Stephen , King of England and Henry of Blois , Bishop of Winchester . Her birthdate is generally believed to have been between 1060 and 1064 ; however , there is some evidence she was born after her father 's accession to the English throne in 1066 . She was the favorite sister of King Henry I of England ; they were probably the youngest of the Conqueror 's children . Adela was a high-spirited and educated woman , with a knowledge of Latin . She married Stephen Henry , son and heir to the count of Blois , sometime between 1080 and 1084 , probably in 1083 . Stephen inherited Blois , Chartres and Meaux in 1089 , and owned over 300 properties , making him one of the wealthiest men of his day . He was a pious and revered leader who managed huge areas of France which he inherited from his father and added to by his sharp administrations . He was , essentially a king in his own right . Stephen-Henry joined the First Crusade , along with his brother-in-law Robert Curthose . Stephen 's letters to Adela form a uniquely intimate insight into the experiences of the Crusade 's leaders . The Count of Blois returned to France in 1100 bringing with him several cartloads of maps , jewels and other treasures , which he deposited at Chartres . He was , however , under an obligation to the pope for agreements made years earlier and returned to Antioch to participate in the crusade of 1101 . He was ultimately killed in an ill-advised charge at the Battle of Ramla . There are many rumors of his cowardice and defection under fire , though some claim these rumors to be the fabrication of later historians . Stephen-Henry was often referred to as `` le Sage , '' and was a great patron of Troubadours and writers . Adela and Stephen 's children are listed here as follows . Their birth order is uncertain . Adela filled in as regent for her husband 's duties during his extended absence as a leader of the First Crusade ( 1095 â `` 1098 ) . He returned to Blois and ruled his vast holdings until he was asked to fulfill an earlier pledge to defend Jerusalem . He was killed in an ill-advised battle charge at Ramalah in 1101 during this second expedition . Adela again acted as regent after her husband 's death . Orderic Vitalis praises her as a `` wise and spirited woman '' who ably governed her husband 's estates and her own . Her combined estates 1102-1110 nearly exceeded the wealth of the King of France at that time . Adela , a devout Benedictine sympathizer , employed several high-ranking tutors to educate her children including troubador poets , as well as Peter Abelard and Peter of Morlait . Her youngest son , Henry , was conceived during the single year Stephan was in France between crusading duties . At two years of age Henry was pledged to the Church at Cluny , Chreit sur Loire as an Oblate child . Henry turned out to be a great genius , who went on to be appointed Abbot of Glastonbury and Bishop of Winchester which eventually made him far more powerful than the king and wealthier than anyone in England . In that capacity he sponsored hundreds of constructions including bridges , canals , palaces , forts , castles and whole villages . In addition , Bishop Blois built dozens of abbeys and chapels and sponsored books including the treasured Winchester Bible . Adela quarrelled with her eldest son William , who was described by unsympathetic authors , as : `` deficient in intelligence as well as degenerate '' . Recent research indicates that he was boisterous and prone to violent bouts of temper but was not degenerate or retarded . Adela appointed his younger brother Theobald to replace him as heir in 1107 . Her son Stephen moved to London in 1111 to join his uncle 's court and became the favorite of his uncle King Henry I ( Beauclerc ) . Upon Beauclerc 's death in Normandy , Stephan Blois seized the English throne . He was crowned King when his cousin ( stepsister ) Empress Mathilda failed to act quickly . This action lead to numerous battles and an era known as `` The Anarchy . '' Adela retired to Marcigny Convent in 1120 . Later that same year , her daughter Lucia-Mahaut , was drowned in the wreck of the White Ship alongside her husband . Adela lived long enough to see her son Stephen on the English throne , and took pride in the ascension of her youngest child Henry Blois to the bishopric of Winchester . She died on 8 March 1137 in Marsilly , Poitou-Charentes , France . See : LoPrete , Kimberly , Adela of Blois . Four Courts Press , Dublin . Adela was portrayed by Nike Arrighi in the two-part BBC TV play Conquest ( 1966 ) , about her father 's conquest of England , part of the series Theatre 625 .

For the Spanish word for `` goodbye '' , see ciao ) A politician or political leader ( from Greek `` polis '' ) is an individual who is involved in influencing public policy and decision making . This includes people who hold decision-making positions in government , and people who seek those positions , whether by means of election , coup d' Ã tat , appointment , electoral fraud , conquest , right of inheritance ( see also : divine right ) or other means . Politics is not limited to governance through public office . Political offices may also be held in corporations , and other entities that are governed by self-defined political processes . Public choice theory involves the use of modern economic tools to study problems that are traditionally in the province of political science . ( A more general term is `` political economy '' , an earlier name for `` economics '' that evokes its practical and theoretical origins but should not be mistaken for the Marxian use of the same term . ) In particular , it studies the behavior of voters , politicians , and government officials as ( mostly ) self-interested agents and their interactions in the social system either as such or under alternative constitutional rules . These can be represented a number of ways , including standard constrained utility maximization , game theory , or decision theory . Public choice analysis has roots in positive analysis ( `` what is '' ) but is often used for normative purposes ( `` what ought to be '' ) , to identify a problem or suggest how a system could be improved by changes in constitutional rules . A key formulation of public choice theory is in terms of rational choice , the agent-based proportioning of scarce means to given ends . An overlapping formulation with a different focus is positive political theory . Another related field is social choice theory . There are also Austrian variants of public choice theory ( suggested by Mises , Hayek , Kirzner , Lopez , and Boettke ) in which it is assumed that bureaucrats and politicians are benevolent but have access to limited information . Although members of governing bodies are often honored , many people today have a poor opinion of politicians as a class . Politicians can also be criticized for becoming `` career politicians '' . A politician who makes politics the source of their income , yet has to face re-election every few years can be less likely to make bold decisions or side with an unpopular bill . Some feel that fear of `` rocking the boat '' leads to a stagnant political climate , in which it becomes hard to address injustices and create change . Various measures have been taken in attempt to mitigate this effect , such as the implementation of term limits and paying them less . Professor Paul Finn has argued that `` the most fundamental fiduciary relationship in our society is manifestly that which exists between the community ( the people ) and the state , its agencies and officials . '' Many suggest the basic problem of stopping Human Rights violations and political negligence stems from the lack of understanding by media and politicians of the laws of fiduciary control . In equity , fiduciary control suggests obligations that not only include duties of good faith and loyalty , but also include duties of skill and competence in managing the people 's interests . After all , Government is a trust structure created by people to manage certain services within society with the politicians depended on by the people to do that task . Therefore the relationship between government and its politicians and the governed is clearly a fiduciary one . Rules such as Sovereign Immunity and Crown and Judicial Immunity are now being targeted as the very tools of oppression that are preventing victims from taking action against the people controlling the country who are causing the failure of care . Originating from within the Courts of Equity , the fiduciary concept was partly designed to prevent those holding positions of power from abusing their authority . This way of thinking suggests anyone accepting any political or government control over the interests of people should be judged by the most exacting fiduciary standards given politicians are the most important fiduciaries in any society given they hold coercive power over the people . The fiduciary relationship arises from the government and its politicians ability to control people with the exercise of that power .
Farrid-udding Abu Abdullah Jafar ibn Mohammad ( , , entitledØ cents Ø Ù Ø Ù Ø Ø Ø Ø Ä dam ul-Shoara or Adam of Poets ) , also written as Rudagi or Rudhagi ( 858 - ca . Rudaki is considered as a founder of the Persian classical literature . He was born in 858 in Rudak ( Panjrud ) , a village located in Panjakent , Tajikistan . Even though most of his biographers assert that he was completely blind , some early biographers are silent about this or do not mention him as being born blind . His accurate knowledge and description of colors , as evident in his poetry , renders this assertion very doubtful . He was the court poet to the Samanid ruler Nasr II ( 914 â `` 943 ) in Bukhara , although he eventually fell out of favor ; his life ended in poverty . Early in his life , the fame of his accomplishments reached the ear of the Samanid Nasr II ibn Ahmad , the ruler of Khorasan and Transoxiana , who invited the poet to his court . Rudaki became his daily companion , amassed great wealth , and become highly honored . It is claimed that he well deserves the title of the father of Persian literature , or the Adam or the Sultan of poets even though he had various predecessors , because he was the first who impressed upon every form of epic , lyric and didactic poetry its peculiar stamp and its individual character . He is also said to have been the founder of the diwan , or the typical form of the complete collection of a poet 's lyrical compositions in a more or less alphabetical order , which all Persian writers use even today . The common opinion was that Rudaki was born blind or was blind from his childhood . However , some of early biographies , like Samani and Nezami Aruzi do not emphasis his blindness as natural-born . Ferdowsi just mentions in his Shahnameh that they recited Kelileh o Demneh to him and he rendered it into poem . Also using some of his poems we can see that he had sight : The great contemporary Iranian scholar , Said Nafisi , has a book about Rudaki called Biography , Environment and Time of Rudaki . In pages 394-404 , he refers to historical events and references in Persian books and poems , as well as the forensic findings of Russians in early 20th century including Mikhail Gerasimov ( who reconstructed Rudaki 's face based on his bones found in his tomb , see above picture ) , concludes that Rudaki and Amir Nasr Samani were Ismailis and there was a revolt against Ismalis around 940 , a few years before Rudaki 's death . This revolt led to the overthrow of the Samanid king and Rudaki , as his close companion , was tortured and blinded and his back was broken while they were blinding him . After this , Rudaki went back to the small town where he was born and died shortly after that . He was buried there . Of the 1,300,000 verses attributed to him , only 52 qasidas , ghazals and rubais survived ; of his epic masterpieces we have nothing beyond a few stray lines in native dictionaries . However , the most serious loss is that of his translation of Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa 's Arabic version of the old Indian fable book Kalila and Dimna ( Panchatantra ) , which he put into Persian verse at the request of his royal patron . Numerous fragments , however , are preserved in the Persian lexicon of Asadi Tusi ( the Lughat al-Furs , ed . P. Horn , GÃ ttingen , 1897 ) . In his qasidas , all devoted to the praise of his sovereign and friend , unequalled models of a refined and delicate taste , very different from the often bombastic compositions of later Persian encomiasts , have survived . His didactic odes and epigrams expressed in well-measured lines a type of Epicurean philosophy of human life and human happiness , and more charming still are the purely lyrical pieces that glorify of love and wine . There is a complete edition of all the extant poems of Rudaki which were known at the end of the 19th century , in Persian text and metrical German translation , together with a biographical account , based on forty-six Persian manuscripts , in Hermann EthÃ 's Rudagi der Samanidendichter ( GÃ ttinger Nachrichten , 1873 , pp . 663 â `` 742 ) ; see also : More recently , in 1963 , SaÊ '' Ä `` d NafÄ `` sÄ `` identified more fragments to be attributed to Rudaki and has assembled them , together with an extensive biography , in Muá Ä `` á - i zindagÄ `` va aá vÄ l va ashÊ '' Ä r-i RÅ `` dakÄ `` . In his 1100th anniversary the Iranian government published a series of stamps , showing his picture and mentioning his 1100th birth anniversary . For his 1150th anniversary an international seminar was held at Vahdat Hall , Tehran , Iran on 21 December 2008 , to mark his 1150th birth anniversary , with President Ahmadinejad and `` Culture minister '' of Tajikistan in attendance . In this seminar , Rudaki was regarded as the father of the Modern Persian literature .

Ulises HernÃ n de la Cruz Bernardo ( born February 8 , 1974 in Piquiucho ) is a Ecuadorian footballer currently with LDU Quito . De la Cruz has set up a charity , Friends of FundeCruz , in his home village to fund a number of projects serving the local community . De la Cruz 's first team was the Ecuadorian side Sociedad Deportivo Quito , for whom he started playing at the age of 16 in the junior division and later the professional division . Nonetheless , De la Cruz 's breakthrough season was with LDU Quito in 1998 . He scored three goals in the final against Emelec ( 7 â `` 0 ) . Alex McLeish , the manager of Scottish Premier League club Hibernian , watched de la Cruz play in international matches for Ecuador , and then signed him in June 2001 for a club record fee of Â # 700,000 . De la Cruz scored two goals for Hibs , both coming in an Edinburgh derby match against Hibs ' local rivals Hearts . He only played for Hibs in one season ; after de la Cruz played in the 2002 FIFA World Cup , he was signed by Graham Taylor for Aston Villa . In De la Cruz 's first season at the club , he played 24 times , scoring one league goal , against Charlton Athletic . He featured more in the 2003-04 season after David O'Leary took over , and an injury to Mark Delaney ensured that de la Cruz could start more games than he had previously , and he signed a new contract for the 2004-05 campaign . During his third season with Aston Villa , de la Cruz became frustrated at his lack of first team opportunities and accused O'Leary of blocking transfers for him , but on August 25 , 2006 , he signed a one year deal with Reading on a free transfer . De la Cruz scored his first Reading goal against Sheffield United in a 3-1 win on January 20 , 2007 . After an impressive first season with Reading , he was offered a contract that would tie him to the Madejski Stadium for two more years . Following their relegation from the Premier League , Reading announced on 16 May 2008 that he would not be offered a new contract . After a few weeks ' training with the club , de la Cruz signed a one-month contract with Birmingham City of the Football League Championship in March 2009 . The player was initially given squad number 27 , previously allocated to Krystian Pearce who had been loaned out for the season ; however the Football League ruled that the number could not be re-used and De la Cruz was given number 36 instead . He made his Birmingham debut as a second-half substitute in the 2 â `` 0 win away at Doncaster Rovers on 14 March . When his contract expired , the player chose not to accept the offer of an extension until the end of the season . Following his release , de la Cruz returned to Ecuador to play for FIFA World Club Cup runner-up LDU Quito , his third spell at the club . De la Cruz played in both 2009 Recopa Sudamericana matches against Sport Club Internacional de Porto Alegre . LDU Quito won the Recopa giving Ulises his first international title . Although not always a first choice for his club , he remained an important member of the national side picking up 90 caps and five goals in his career to date . He was a fixture in the Ecuadorian team in the 2006 FIFA World Cup which reached the second round . In his homeland , de la Cruz is one of Ecuador 's most popular players , both for his footballing talent and his charitable projects . The Supporters Trust At Reading ( STAR ) have organised a facility to allow Reading and other supporters the means to donate to the Ulises de la Cruz Foundation . Due to Ecuador 's poor start in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers , de la Cruz and his teammate , Ivan Hurtado sharply criticized the coach and the atmosphere in the team . As a result , they were excluded from selection for the last two matches of 2007 against Paraguay and Peru . Born in Piquiucho , a small village in the Valle del Chota , one of Ecuadorâ s poorest regions , De la Cruz set up the charity Friends of FundeCruz to fund a number of projects serving the local community , to which he donates about 10 % of his salary . Friends of FundeCruz is also a British registered charity . At one of the Reading matches , fans were asked to donate money to his fund and he raised a few thousand pounds . Money will also be raised at the Ruta del Sol in February 2008 . The foundation funds amongst other things a water treatment plant , a health center and a sports ground . He has been named a UNICEF ambassador .
The Toronto Symphony Orchestra ( TSO ) is a Canadian orchestra based in Toronto , Ontario . The TSO was founded in 1922 as the New Symphony Orchestra , and gave its first concert at Massey Hall in April 1923 . The orchestra changed its name to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in 1927 . The TSO continued to give regular concerts at Massey Hall from 1923 to 1982 . Currently , TSO performances are held in Roy Thomson Hall . Andrew Davis was the TSO 's music director from 1975 to 1988 , and is currently the orchestra 's conductor laureate . The current TSO music director is Peter Oundjian , who was appointed to the post in January 2003 and formally became music director with the 2004-2005 season . In February 2007 , Oundjian extended his contract with the TSO to 2012 . The orchestra had financial and audience size problems before the appointment of Oundjian as its music director . In 1992 , TSO musicians had accepted a 16 % pay cut because of a threat of bankruptcy to the orchestra , with a promise from management to make up the loss in subsequent contract negotiations . By 1999 , this pay restoration did not happen , which led to an 11-week musicians ' strike that autumn . Relations between the musicians and management had deteriorated to the point where music director Jukka-Pekka Saraste had offered to serve as mediator in the situation . In addition , there was a lack of public sympathy to the orchestra musicians ' situation . By 2001 , the orchestra had debt of $ 7 million ( Canadian ) , and both its executive director , Ed Smith , and Saraste had left the ensemble . Subscribers numbered around 20,000 as of the 2000-2001 season , and audience average capacity was 56 % in 2001 . By the 2006-2007 season , the subscriber base had increased to about 25,000 , and the audience average capacity also increased to 84 % . In November 2008 , the orchestra reported its third consecutive year of budget surpluses , with average audience attendance of 88 % ( excluding concerts for schoolchildren ) , although the orchestra still retains overall debt of $ 8.9 million ( Canadian ) . Concerts of the orchestra are broadcast over CBC Radio 2 . The 2005 documentary film Five Days in September : The Rebirth of an Orchestra ( Canada , 2005 ) recorded the first days of the TSO 's inaugural season with Oundjian as its new music director . The TSO is governed by a board of 25 directors , led by Ana Lopes , Robert W. Corcoran , and Allan S. Kimberley . TSoundcheck is designed to connect young people to classical music . Based on reduced fares on selected concerts and seating ( $ 14 flat rate ) , it targets 15 to 35 year olds . It does not require the buyer to be a student with only the age range as the governing factor . Tickets become available about a week before a performance and the amount of availability is dependant on ticket sales and the symphony 's discretion . The Adopt-a-player program is aimed at elementary schools in the GTA and surrounding area . Selected musicians from the Toronto Symphony Orchestra are `` adopted '' by schools . Each musician collaborates with a Grade 4 or 5 class for one day a week for six weeks to teach the elements of music and aid in the creation of a new piece of music . At the end of the program , each class presents their composition to other program participants , as well as family and friends at a Showcase Event . Students also have the opportunity to attend a TSO rehearsal and an evening , weekend or student concert . Members of the symphony are available to lead masterclasses for high school bands and orchestras . The members collaborate with existing music programs , focusing on specific needs such as solo and orchestral performance , technique or work on specific repertoire . In an effort to bring classical music to children between the ages of 5 and 12 , the TSO organize a series of five one-hour concerts on Saturday afternoons . Concerts are held at the Roy Thompson Hall and may feature guest artists . The post of concertmaster has been vacant since Jacques Israelievitch resigned in 2008 . An international search has been on-going since that time .
Popol Vuh was a German Krautrock band founded by pianist and keyboardist Florian Fricke in 1970 together with Thomas Farren ( vocals ) Holger Trulzsch ( percussion ) John Leighton ( vocals ) and Frank Fiedler ( electronics ) . The band was managed by members of the Daggit-Avena firm , Gregorio Daggit and Salvatore Avena . Other important members during the next two decades included Daniel Fichelscher , Klaus Wiese and Robert Eliscu . The band took its name from the Popol Vuh , a manuscript containing the mythology of the Post-Classic QuichÃ Maya people of highland Guatemala and south east Mexico . The first album , Affenstunde , released in 1970 , can be regarded as one of the earliest ambient music , space music or New Age music works , featuring the then new sounds of the Moog synthesizer together with ethnic percussion . This continued for only one more album , In den GÃ rten Pharaos , before Fricke largely abandoned electronic instruments in favor of piano-led compositions from 1972 's Hosianna Mantra forward . This album also marked the start of exploring overtly religious themes rather than a more generally spiritual feeling within the music . The group evolved to include all kinds of instruments : wind and strings , electric and acoustic alike , combined to convey a mystical aura that made their music spiritual and introspective . Popul Vuh influenced many other bands from Europe with their uniquely soft but elaborate instrumentations , that took inspiration from Tibet , Africa , and pre-Columbian America . They created dream-like soundscapes along with psychedelic walls of sound , and are regarded as precursors of contemporary world music , as well of new age music and ambient music . The band contributed soundtracks to the films of Werner Herzog , including Aguirre , the Wrath of God , Nosferatu , Fitzcarraldo , Cobra Verde , Heart of Glass and The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser , in which Fricke appeared . Florian Fricke died in Munich on December 29 , 2001 , and the group disbanded . `` Florian was and remains an important forerunner of contemporary ethnic and religious music . He chose electronic music and his big Moog to free himself from the restraints of traditional music , but soon discovered that he did n't get a lot out of it and opted for the acoustic path instead . Here , he went on to create a new world , which Werner Herzog loves so much , transforming the thought patterns of electronic music into the language of acoustic ethno music . '' Note : there are two distinct issues of the compilation Best of Popol Vuh - Werner Herzog . These are distinct from The Best Soundtracks from Werner Herzog Films , though the selections of tracks overlap .
A premium station is a category of railway station on Melbourne 's suburban rail network which is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne . In terms of station standards , a premium station is a high standard station which sits above the medium standard host stations and the low standard unmanned stations . The premium station program was commenced in 1994 under the Public Transport Corporation . , with Mount Waverley being the first station receiving premium status . By the end of 1995 the number of staffed stations increased from 35 to 51 . The five City Loop stations ( Flinders Street , Southern Cross , Flagstaff , Melbourne Central , and Parliament ) are all premium stations . Other stations are assigned premium status based mainly on their level of patronage or their safeworking facilities . 24 existing stations will be upgraded from unmanned or host to premium or constructed in the near future to bring the total number of premium stations to 101 . 1 Upgrade to be completed by 2013 as part of a $ 13.3 million dollar project by the Victorian Government 2 Construction to be completed by 2013 as part of the extension of the Epping railway line from Epping to South Morang . 3 Upgrade to be completed by 2012 as part of the electrification of the Bendigo railway line from Sydenham to Sunbury . 4 Construction to commence sometime in 2010 as part of the Victorian Government 's ` New Stations for Growth Areas ' program .
A head crash is a hard-disk failure that occurs when a readâ `` write head of a hard disk drive comes in contact with its rotating platter , resulting in permanent and usually irreparable damage to the magnetic media on the platter surface . A head normally rides on a thin film of moving air entrapped at the surface of its platter ( some drives of the mid-1990s used a thin liquid layer instead ) . The topmost layer of the platter is made of a Teflon-like material that acts like a lubricant . Underneath is a layer of sputtered carbon . These two layers protect the magnetic layer ( data storage area ) from most accidental touches of the read-write head . The disk read-and-write head is made using thin film techniques that include materials hard enough to scratch through the protective layers . A head crash can be initiated by a force that puts enough pressure on the platters from the heads to scratch through to the magnetic storage layer . A tiny particle of dirt or other detritus , excessive shock or vibration , or accidentally dropping a running drive can cause a head to bounce against its disk , destroying the thin magnetic coating on the area the heads come in contact with , and often damaging the heads in the process . After this initial crash , countless numbers of fine particles from the damaged area can land onto other areas and can cause more head crashes when the heads move over those particles , quickly causing significant damage and data loss , and rendering the drive useless . Some modern hard disks incorporate free fall sensors to offer protection against head crashes caused by accidentally dropping the drive . Since most modern drives spin at rates between 5,400 and 15,000 RPM , the damage caused to the magnetic coating can be extensive . At 7,200 RPM the edge of the platter is traveling at over 120 k , and as the crashed head drags over the platter surface the read-write head generally overheats , making the drive or at least parts of it unusable until the heads cool . Older drives typically rotated far more slowly and had larger heads flying higher above the surface of the medium . However , since in many cases the medium was housed in a removable cartridge or pack and since air filtration was comparatively crude , crashes were fairly frequent and invariably expensive .

Interstate 84 ( I-84 ) is an Interstate Highway in the Western United States that runs from Portland , Oregon , to a junction with Interstate 80 near Echo , Utah . The highway is a fork of I-80 to serve the Pacific Northwest , and was originally numbered Interstate 80N . The highway was signed with the I-84 designation in 1980 , when a 1977 change in guidelines took effect that discouraged highway numbers with directional suffixes . The renumbering resulted in two highways being numbered I-84 , with the other residing in the Northeastern United States . The highway serves and connects Portland , Oregon and Boise , Idaho with Ogden , Utah . Seattle , Washington is indirectly served by I-84 via a connection with Interstate 82 . With the connection to I-80 , I-84 connects these cities to points east . In the Portland metropolitan area , I-84 is sometimes referred to as the `` Banfield Freeway '' or simply `` the Banfield '' , although the official name is the Banfield Expressway . This freeway is named after Thomas H. Banfield , the chairman of the Oregon Transportation Commission from 1943 to 1950 . East of Pendleton , I-84 climbs Emigrant Hill , a 6 % grade , into the Blue Mountains . This grade is known for the fact that the westbound lanes switchback twice on its descent into Pendleton . Eastbound lanes feature what are the tightest curves allowed on the Interstate Highway system , even though those curves are on the uphill ( eastbound ) direction . This grade is also well known due to the fact that it features such a great distance between eastbound and westbound lanes , nearly 2 m between the opposite directions of travel at some points . The road summits at 4193 feet ( 1278 m ) above sea level before descending to the Grand Ronde River and La Grande . It passes by North Powder and Baker City and through the Burnt River canyon . Outside of Farewell Bend , it crosses into the Mountain Time Zone then briefly follows the Snake River ( Brownlee Reservoir ) , then continues to Ontario to cross the Snake River into Idaho . I-84 enters Idaho by crossing the Snake River at Ontario , Oregon . From there , it continues on to the major cities of the Treasure Valley , or Boise metropolitan area , including Caldwell , Nampa , Meridian , and Boise ( where I-184 connects travelers to downtown ) . From Boise , I-84 continues southeast towards Twin Falls , after passing near several small cities ( Mountain Home , Glenns Ferry , and Jerome ) . Just east of Jerome , I-84 passes within 5 miles ( 8 km ) of Twin Falls , but does not cross the Snake River Canyon or into Twin Falls County . Access to Twin Falls is afforded by an intersection with US 93 at Exit 173 ; US 93 southbound crosses the Snake River via the Perrine Bridge . After Twin Falls , I-84 continues through Burley and Heyburn . Approximately 7 miles ( 11 km ) east of Declo in rural Cassia County , I-84 meets I-86 . I-84 heads southeast towards Utah and I-86 heads east , then northeast to American Falls and Pocatello , following the Oregon Trail . From Idaho , I-84 enters Utah at a point approximately 7 miles ( 11.3 km ) from Snowville in Box Elder County . It proceeds southeast towards Tremonton where I-84 joins I-15 . Just south , at Corinne , Utah , I-84 joins the route of the First Transcontinental Railroad which the highway follows to its terminus . I-15 \/ I-84 pass to the west of Ogden where I-84 separates from I-15 and follows the Weber River . As the freeway passes through Weber Canyon it also passes through several small farming communities , including Morgan , where the Browning Arms Company headquarters can be seen from the freeway . Also visible in the canyon is Devil 's Slide , an unusual rock formation just off the freeway . Farther up the canyon is the Thousand Mile Tree , planted by Union Pacific Railroad workers to mark 1000 m from the railroad 's origin in Omaha , Nebraska . The freeway ends at Echo , a near ghost town that before served as a stopover for the railroad , at a junction with Interstate 80 . Also near the junction is Echo Reservoir and Echo Dam . The Utah sections of I-84 not concurrent with Interstate 15 are defined at Utah Code Annotated Â 72-4-114 ( 4 ) . American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials established guidelines recommending that `` suffixed '' highways , such as I-80N , be renumbered . In 1977 , Idaho officials recommended that I-80N be renumbered to I-84 . The motion was seconded by officials in Utah , but opposed by Oregon and Washington . The motion passed on July 7 , 1977 , and the states were given until July 1 , 1980 to implement a co-ordinated renumbering strategy . After renumbering , I-84 violated the Interstate Highway Numbering Convention by being south of I-82 . The Portland segment of then-I-80N was proposed to run on the Mount Hood Freeway . Plans for this were officially dropped in 1978 after a successful freeway revolt .

Melbourne is a Georgian market town in South Derbyshire , England . It is about eight miles south of Derby and two miles from the River Trent . In 1837 a then tiny settlement in Australia was named after William Lamb , 2nd Viscount Melbourne , Queen Victoria 's first Prime Minister , and thus indirectly takes its name from Melbourne Hall , seat of the Lamb family , and the village . The name Melbourne means `` mill stream '' ( or `` mill spring '' ) . It was first recorded in Domesday Book ( DB 1086 Mileburne = mill stream ) as a royal manor . A parish church was built around 1120 . In 1311 Robert de Holand fortified the existing royal manor house to create Melbourne Castle , though the fortification was never completed . Jean , duc de Bourbon , the most important French prisoner taken at the Battle of Agincourt ( 1416 ) , was detained at the castle for 19 years . Mary , Queen of Scots was to be imprisoned at Melbourne Castle , but it had deteriorated into a poor state of repair . By the early 17th Century it had fallen into decay and was demolished , although some remains can still be seen . Melbourne Hall was originally owned by the church ; it was constructed in stages , mainly in the 17th and 18th century . During the Second World War a military training railway was operated to the north of the now defunct Melbourne railway station . Since 2005 Melbourne has run an Arts Festival every September . Melbourne parish church has been described as a `` cathedral in miniature '' and is one of five churches in Melbourne . The Domesday Book records a church and priest here in 1086 . The present church was built about 1120 , and most of the original masonry is intact , except for the eastern end which has been refurbished . The roofs , naves , aisles and the aisle windows date from the restoration of the 1630s . There was also a restoration done by Gilbert Scott in 1859-62 . Melbourne Hall was originally the rectory house for the Bishop of Carlisle , but was substantially rebuilt by Thomas and George Coke in the early 18th century . The hall 's gardens were laid out with the assistance of Royal gardeners in 1704 . They contain examples of the ironwork of Derby ironsmith , Robert Bakewell . Melbourne Pool was originally used by the nearby mill . The hall is open to the public in August . The Thomas Cook Memorial Cottages in High Street were built by Thomas Cook who started popular travel in England . Cook was born in Melbourne in 1808 though his birth-place was demolished in 1968 . The buildings built in 1890-91 include fourteen cottages , a bakehouse , a laundry and Mission Hall . They still provide accommodation for some of Melbourne 's senior citizens . Melbourne Market Place is the location of Melbourne 's main shops , including the Co-op Building and monument which was refurbished in 1998 . Melbourne has two schools : an Infant school and a Junior school , sharing a site which also contains a youth center . The town plays host to Melbourne Rugby Football Club , Melbourne United Football Club , and Melbourne Town Cricket Club . The town contains many Georgian buildings and in the 19th Century was a center for framework knitting and footwear manufacture , e.g. Fairystep Shoes . Market gardens have always been a major part of the economy , though now only a handful remain . East Midlands Airport , five miles to the east of the town , was opened in the 1960s and has now become a significant regional transport hub . The town 's bus service is run by Arriva Midlands . Previously , Trent Barton maintained a small garage in Melbourne , the site going on to become a supermarket . It maintained routes to Swadlincote , Derby , Aston-on-Trent and Weston-on-Trent . Bus services for pupils run to Chellaston school every morning and afternoon . There have been links to East Midlands Airport which were recently axed . Spar , Budgens , Melbourne News , Fish and Chips , Birds ( bakery ) , Elle of Melbourne ( clothing ) , Blatch 's ( electricals ) , Co-op Travel , and Cream Interior Design . Services in Melbourne include : Natwest , Post Office , Co-op Pharmacy , Fair Trade , The Athenaeum ( an internet cafe ) , a library , leisure center and a youth club . There are also several pubs . In the past Melbourne has had three brass bands which have disappeared over the years . In 1992 a new group formed , and became the Melbourne Town Band . The Town Band continues to play at Melbourne 's events today . These include the carnival , held every summer , and the carols in the Market Place .

Naresuan University is a government sponsored university in Phitsanulok , northern Thailand . It was established as a separate university on July 29 , 1990 , which was the 400th anniversary of the start of the reign of Phitsanulok-born King Naresuan the Great . A courtyard with a statue of King Naresuan is located on the grounds and the students regularly pay their respects before it . The university has about 20,000 full time students . On January 18 , 1964 , the Royal Thai Ministry of Education resolved to create a branch of the College of Education ( in Bangkok ) for teacher training in each region of the country . On January 25 , 1967 , the Phitsanulok campus was established as the fourth branch of the College of Education and was meant to serve mainly the northern provinces . In 1974 the College of Education was upgraded to university status and was named Srinakharinwirot University . Originally , only the third and fourth years of university study were offered at Phitsanulok , and students were admitted by competitive examination after completing the curriculum at one of the nation 's associate degree level teacher training colleges . In 1976 , the first and second years were added . Other majors besides education were gradually included , and in 1990 the Phitsanulok campus became independent of Srinakarinwirot University . It was designated as Naresuan University during the celebrations of the 400th anniversary of King Naresuan the Great 's ascending to the throne . Naresuan University had second campus in Phayao , which opened in 1999 and upgraded to university level and named `` University of Phayao '' in 2010 , and also offers extension courses across the country by 9 education centers , including Bangkok . In September 2006 , Naresuan University was ranked as `` Very Good '' in a study conducted on Thai universities by the Commission on Higher Education . The Naresuan University Art and Culture Gallery holds over 100 artistic works by culturally significant Thai artists .

Ellen Axson Wilson ( May 15 , 1860 -- August 6 , 1914 ) , first wife of Woodrow Wilson , was First Lady of the United States from 1913 until her death . Born Ellen Louise Axson in Savannah , Georgia , the daughter of the Reverend Samuel Edward Axson , a Presbyterian minister , and Margaret Jane ( nÃ e Hoyt ) Axson , Ellen was a lady of refined tastes with a fondness for art , music and literature . Thomas Woodrow Wilson first saw her when he was about three and she was only a baby . In April 1883 , Woodrow visited his cousin Jesse Woodrow Wilson in Rome , Georgia and met Ellen againâ '' she was now keeping house for her widowed father . He thought , `` what splendid laughing eyes ! '' . They were engaged five months later but postponed the wedding , while he did postgraduate work at Johns Hopkins University and she nursed her ailing father . Wilson , aged 28 , married Ellen , aged 25 , on June 24 , 1885 , at the home of the bride 's paternal grandfather in Savannah , Georgia . The wedding was performed jointly by his father , the Reverend Joseph R. Wilson , and her grandfather , the Reverend Isaac Stockton Keith Axson . They honeymooned at Waynesville , a mountain resort in western North Carolina . That same year , Bryn Mawr College offered Dr. Wilson a teaching position at an annual salary of $ 1,500 . He and his bride lived near the campus , keeping her little brother with them . Humorously insisting that her own children must not be born Yankees , she went to relatives in Georgia for the birth of Margaret in 1886 and Jessie in 1887 . Eleanor , however , was born in Connecticut in 1889 , while Wilson was teaching at Wesleyan University . His distinguished career at Princeton University began in 1890 , bringing his wife new social responsibilities . From such demands she took refuge , as always , in art . She had studied briefly in New York , and the quality of her paintings compares favorably with professional art of the period . As First Lady , Mrs. Wilson painted and drew sketches in a studio set up on the third floor of the White House , donating much of her work to charity . She arranged the White House weddings of two of her daughters . The Wilsons had preferred to begin the administration without an inaugural ball , and the First Lady 's entertainments were simple , but her unaffected cordiality made her parties successful . In their first year , she convinced her scrupulous husband that it would be perfectly proper to invite influential legislators to a private dinner , and when such an evening led to agreement on a tariff bill , he told a friend , `` You see what a wise wife I have ! '' A descendant of slave owners , Wilson lent her prestige to the cause of improving housing in the capital 's largely black slums . Visiting dilapidated alleys , she brought them to the attention of debutantes and Congressmen . Her death spurred passage of a remedial bill she had worked for . Her health failing slowly from Bright 's disease , she died in the White House on August 6 , 1914 . On the day before her death , she made her physician promise to tell Wilson `` later '' that she hoped he would marry again ; she murmured at the end , '' ... take good care of my husband . '' She was buried in Rome , Georgia among her family .
A symbol is something such as an particular mark that represents some piece of information . For example , a red octagon may be a symbol for `` STOP '' . On maps , tables would mean campsite . Numerals are symbols for numbers ( amounts ) . All language consists of symbols . Personal names are symbols representing individuals . Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung , who studied archetypes , proposed an alternative definition of symbol , distinguishing it from the term sign . In Jung 's view , a sign stands for something known , as a word stands for its referent . He contrasted this with symbol , which he used to stand for something that is unknown and that can not be made clear or precise . An example of a symbol in this sense is Christ as a symbol of the archetype called self . For example , written languages are composed of a variety of different symbols that create words . Through these written words , humans communicate with each other . Kenneth Burke described Homo sapiens as a `` symbol-using , symbol making , and symbol misusing animal '' to indicate that a person creates symbols in her or his life as well as misuses them . One example he uses to indicate his meaning behind symbol misuse is the story of a man who , when told a particular food item was whale blubber , could barely keep from throwing it up . Later , his friend discovered it was actually just a dumpling . But the man 's reaction was a direct consequence of the symbol of `` blubber '' representing something inedible in his mind . In addition , the symbol of `` blubber '' for the man was created by him through various kinds of learning . Burke emphasizes that humans gain this type of learning that helps us create symbols by seeing various print sources , our life experiences , and symbols about the past . Burke goes on to describe symbols as also being derived from Sigmund Freud 's work on condensation and displacement further stating that they are not just relevant to the theory of dreams , but also to `` normal symbol systems '' . He says they are related through `` substitution '' where one word , phrase , or symbol is substituted for another in order to change the meaning . In other words , if a person does not understand a certain word or phrase , another person may substitute a synonym or symbol in order to get the meaning of the original word or phrase across . However , when faced with that new way of interpreting a specific symbol , a person may change their already formed ideas to incorporate the new information based on how the symbol is expressed to the person . Jean Dalby Clift says that people not only add their own interpretations to symbols , they also create personal symbols that represent their own understanding of their lives : what she calls `` core images '' of the person . She argues that symbolic work with these personal symbols or core images can be as useful as working with dream symbols in psychoanalysis or counseling . The word symbol came to the English language by way of Middle English , from Old French , from Latin , from the Greek Ï Ï Î 1\/4 Î Î Î '' Î Î 1\/2 ( sÃ 1\/2 mbolon ) from the root words Ï Ï Î 1\/2 - ( syn - ) , meaning `` together , '' and Î Î Î '' Î ( bolÄ `` ) , `` a throw '' , having the approximate meaning of `` to throw together '' , literally a `` co-incidence '' , also `` sign , ticket , or contract '' . The earliest attestation of the term is in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes where Hermes on seeing the tortoise exclaims Ï Ï Î 1\/4 Î Î Î '' Î Î 1\/2 á 1\/4 Î Î Î 1\/4 Î Î Î 1\/4 Î Î á 3\/4 1\/2 á 1\/2 Î 1\/2 Î Ï Î Î 1\/4 Î Î 1\/2 `` symbolon ( symbol\/sign\/portent \/ encounter\/chance find ? ) of joy to me ! '' before turning it into a lyre . A symbol 's meaning may be modified by various factors including popular usage , history , and contextual intent . This history of a symbol is one of many factors in determining a particular symbol 's apparent meaning . Consequently , symbols with emotive power carry problems analogous to false etymologies . For example , the Rebel Flag of the American South predates the American Civil War . An early variant of the crossed bars resembled the Scottish Flag . Juxtaposition further complicates the matter . Similar fiveâ `` pointed stars might signify a law enforcement officer or a member of the armed services , depending the uniform .
The Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) , was established in 1905 . The agency , led by a Secretary and overseen by the Governor , is a Washington governmental agency that constructs , maintains , and regulates the use of the state 's transportation infrastructure . WSDOT is responsible for more than 20,000 lane-miles of roadway , nearly 3,000 vehicular bridges and 524 other structures . This infrastructure includes rail lines , state highways , state ferries ( considered part of the highway system ) and state airports WSDOT was originally founded as the Washington State Highway Board and the Washington State Highways Department on March 13 , 1905 , when then-governor Albert Mead signed a bill that gave $ 110,000 USD to fund new roads that linked the state . The State Highway Board was managed by State Treasurer , State Auditor , and Highway Commissioner Joseph M. Snow and the Board first met on April 17 , 1905 to plan the 12 original state roads . The first state highway districts , each managed by a District Engineer , were established in 1918 . During this period , the construction of highways began . In 1921 , the State Highway Board was replaced by the Washington Highway Committee and the Washington State Highways Department became a division of the Washington State Department of Public Works . The first gas tax ( 1 Â cents per gallon ) was levied and Homer Hadley started planning a pontoon bridge across Lake Washington , which would later become the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge , which opened on July 2 , 1940 . In 1923 , the State Highways Department separated from the Public Works Department and organized the first official system of highways , Washington 's state road system . In 1926 , the U.S. government approved the U.S. route system , which connected the country by road . 11 U.S. Routes entered Washington at the time . Later in 1929 , the Highway Committee was merged with the State Highways Department . The Lake Washington Floating Bridge and the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge opened in 1940 . The Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapsed because of winds on November 7 , 1940 , earning it the name Galloping Gertie . On June 29 , 1956 , President Dwight Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 , which started the Interstate Highway System . Originally , 2 Interstates entered Washington . Starting in 1961 , the Interstate Highways started to be built . There were 2 more Interstates to build and most work was not completed until the 1970s . In 1964 , the Highways Department was renamed to WSDOT and the state highways were renumbered to the current system . Metro Transit was created in 1972 and work on highways continued very fast . The North Cascades Highway ( SR 20 ) was completed in 1972 and the first HOV lanes in Washington were installed on SR 520 in 1972 . The Washington State Transportation Commission was established in 1977 and the first meeting was held on September 21 , 1977 . On February 13 , 1979 , the western pontoons of the Hood Canal Bridge were swept away by a wind storm . In 1980 , Mount St. Helens erupted and caused damage to many state highways , mainly SR 504 . The Hood Canal Replacement Bridge opened on October 3 , 1982 and the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge collapsed on November 25 , 1990 . In 1991 , a smaller renumbering of state highways occurred . The renumbering produced some new highways and either realigned or removed highways from the system . In 1996 , Sound Transit was formed and in the same year , the Washington State Transportation Commission adopted its first 20-year transportation plan . Throughout the 1990s , WSDOT focused more and more on rail systems and partnered with Amtrak to make a train route that went from Canada to Oregon , which would later become the Amtrak Cascades . The 2001 Nisqually earthquake damaged most state highways around the Seattle metropolitan area and most of the budget was turned over to the Puget Sound region to help rebuild and repair roads and bridges . WSDOT divides Washington into 6 regions , the Olympic , Northwest Southwest , North Central , South Central , and Eastern . The Northwest Region is further divided into 3 more regions , which are King County , Snohomish County , and Baker ( Whatcom , Skagit , Island , and San Juan counties ) . WSDOT is overseen by the Governor of Washington , who currently is Christine Gregoire . The Secretary of Transportation , Paula Hammond , also oversees WSDOT . WSDOT manages the official ferry service in Washington . WSDOT 's ferry service , called Washington State Ferries , is the largest in the United States and third largest in the world . Ferries had been in the Puget Sound since the 1950s . There are 10 routes and 28 ferries currently operating . There are currently about 250 projects that WSDOT is currently planning or constructing . Some of the main projects in the future include the Alaskan Way Viaduct , the SR 520 Floating Bridge , the ferry terminals , the I-5 Crash barrier project , SR 704 , and more .

Theodor Schwann ( 7 December 1810 , Neuss -- 11 January 1882 ) was a German physiologist . His many contributions to biology include the development of cell theory , the discovery of Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system , the discovery and study of pepsin , the discovery of the organic nature of yeast , and the invention of the term metabolism . Schwann was the first of MÃ 1\/4 ller 's pupils to break with vitalism and work towards a physico-chemical explanation of life . Schwann 's rediscovery of the cell came when he was paying particular attention to the cytoplasm of a plant cell , and noticed its jelly-like consistency . He went on to view animal cells , and noted that they had different properties . MÃ 1\/4 ller also directed Schwann 's attention to the process of digestion , which Schwann showed in 1837 to depend essentially on the presence of a ferment he called pepsin . Schwann also examined the question of spontaneous generation , which led to its eventual disproof . In the course of his experiments , he discovered the organic nature of yeast . In fact , the whole germ theory of Pasteur , as well as its antiseptic applications by Lister , can be traced to Schwann 's influence . Once , when Schwann was dining with Matthias Jakob Schleiden ( who in 1837 had viewed and stated that new plant cells formed from the nuclei of old plant cells ) in 1837 , the conversation turned on the nuclei of plants and animal cells . Schwann remembered seeing similar structures in the cells of the notochord ( as had been shown by MÃ 1\/4 ller ) and instantly realized the importance of connecting the two phenomena . The resemblance was confirmed without delay by both observers , and the results soon appeared in his famous Microscopic Investigations on the Accordance in the Structure and Growth of Plants and Animals , in which he declared that `` All living things are composed of cells and cell products that are reproduced '' , in the kitchen Thus cell theory was definitely constituted . In the course of his verification of cell theory , in which Schwann traversed the whole field of histology , he proved the cellular origin and development of the most highly differentiated tissues including nails , feathers , and tooth enamel . His generalization became the foundation of modern histology , and in the hands of Rudolf Virchow ( whose cellular pathology was an inevitable deduction from Schwann ) placed modern pathology on a truly scientific basis .
British Railways 10800 was a diesel locomotive built by the North British Locomotive Company for British Railways in 1950 . It had been ordered by the London , Midland and Scottish Railway in 1946 but did not appear until after the 1948 nationalisation of the railways . Design was by George Ivatt and the locomotive was intended as a possible replacement for steam locomotives on secondary and branch lines . The single-cab layout ( long bonnet forward ) gave the driver a poor view of the road ahead but it was no worse than in a steam locomotive so it would have been considered acceptable at the time . During its brief time on the Southern Region , 10800 gained the nickname ` The Wonder Engine ' , from the locomotive department 's daily query , ' I wonder if it will go today ' . Due to having been ordered by the LMS before the creation of British Railways ( BR ) , 10800 became the first BR mixed-traffic Diesel-Electric locomotive when it was delivered in 1950 . Operationally it was successful enough for BR to order a batch of 54 in 1955 although these , destined to be come BR Class 15 and BR Class 16 , used the improved YHXL engine . In 1961 or 1962 ( sources differ ) No. 10800 was bought by Brush Traction and rebuilt for experiments in a.c. power transmission . Brush named the locomotive `` Hawk '' . Specifications that changed after rebuilding were : It was used until 1968 , and slowly stripped for parts from April 1972 , until it was finally scrapped at Brush Traction , Loughborough in 1976 .

There is another directly quoted tonal passage in the work in the form of a Carinthian folk song in the second section of the first movement , which returns briefly before the coda in the second movement . This is perhaps the only section which does not derive its materials from the row . Portia is an inner satellite of Uranus . It was discovered from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 3 January 1986 , and was given the temporary designation S\/1986 U 1 . The moon is named after Portia , the heroine of William Shakespeare 's play The Merchant of Venice . It is also designated Uranus XII . Portia is the second-largest inner satellite of Uranus after Puck . The Portian orbit , which lies inside Uranus ' synchronous orbital radius , is slowly decaying due to tidal deceleration . The moon will one day either break up into a planetary ring or hit Uranus . It heads a group of satellites called the Portia Group , which includes Bianca , Cressida , Desdemona , Juliet , Rosalind , Cupid , Belinda and Perdita . These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties . Little is known about Portia beyond its size of about 140 km , orbit , and geometric albedo of about 0.08 . In the Voyager 2 images , Portia appears as an elongated object whose major axis points towards Uranus . The ratio of axes of the Portia 's prolate spheroid is 0.8 Â 0.1 .
The Orange-bellied Euphonia ( Euphonia xanthogaster ) is a species of bird in the Fringillidae ( finch ) family . They were formerly considered tanagers ( Thraupidae ) . It is found in Bolivia , Brazil , Colombia , Ecuador , Guyana , Panama , Peru , and Venezuela . Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests .

LozÃ re , is a department in southeast France near the Massif Central , named after Mont LozÃ re . LozÃ re is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on March 4 , 1790 . It was created from part of the former province of Languedoc . The Beast of GÃ vaudan was a creature that terrorized the general area of the former province of GÃ vaudan , with nearly identical borders to today 's LozÃ re , in the Margeride Mountains , in the general timeframe of 1764 to 1767 . The kinds of cheese that are most esteemed at Rome , where the various good things of all nations are to be judged of by comparison , are those that come from the provinces of Nemausus , and more especially the villages there of Lesura and Gabalis ; but its excellence is only very short-lived , and it must be eaten while it is fresh . The geography of LozÃ re is complicated , covering four mountain ranges . In the north-west , the basalt plateau of Aubrac rises between 1,000 and 1,450 m , with a cold humid climate influenced by the Atlantic . The north and north-east of the department contains the Margeride mountains , which are formed of granite , and have peaks between 1,000 and 1,550 m. The climate here is also cold , but dryer than Aubrac , with less snow . The Causses are a series of very dry calcium plateaus in the south-west , and the south-east contains the CÃ vennes , which include the highest point in the department , the granite Mont LozÃ re at 1,702 m. The department also contains numerous rivers , above and below ground , including the Tarn , whose source is on Mont LozÃ re , and which flows through the Gorges du Tarn in the Causses . LozÃ re is the northernmost part of the current Languedoc-Roussillon region and is surrounded by the departments of Cantal , Haute-Loire , ArdÃ che , Gard and Aveyron . On the General Council of LozÃ re a majority is held by the right , with 16 councillors to the left 's 9 . The President of the Council is Jean-Paul Pourquier , who represents the canton of Massegros . LozÃ re elects two Deputies to the National Assembly , and one Senator , all of whom , as of 2009 , represent the Union for a Popular Movement ( UMP ) . The main activities are farming and tourism , even though there is barely any agricultural farming in LozÃ re due to poor soil quality . Most farms are cattle farms . The hardy Aubrac is the most commonly farmed cattle breed here . The region has one of the lowest rates of unemployment in France , which may be attributed to the enforced long standing tradition whereby young people emigrate to cities such as Lyon , Marseille , Montpellier when they reach working age . LozÃ re has a surface area of 5,167 km2 . It is a rural department , with relatively little land taken up by roads and buildings . Overall the land use is divided as follows : The inhabitants of the department are called LozÃ riens . LozÃ re is the least populated French department . The low population density ( 14 inhabitant\/km Â ) is thought to be due to the region 's poor soils and to rural depopulation , which was particularly high in the region between 1850 and 1910 . In recent years , the department 's population has increased slightly , as it is thought to offer a good quality of life , and due to improved transport networks . However , the population is older than the national average . Tourist activities include caving and a variety of sports , such as skiing and kayaking . LozÃ re contains a part of the CÃ vennes National Park . LozÃ re is considered one of the best areas in France for trout fishing . Rivers such as the Lot , Tarn and TruyÃ re are particularly noted for their trout populations .
The NASDAQ Stock Market , also known as the NASDAQ , is an American stock exchange . `` NASDAQ '' originally stood for `` National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations '' . It is the largest electronic screen-based equity securities trading market in the United States and second-largest by market capitalization in the world . As of January 13 , 2011 , there are 2,872 listings . The NASDAQ has more trading volume than any other electronic stock exchange in the world . It was founded in 1971 by the National Association of Securities Dealers ( NASD ) , who divested themselves of it in a series of sales in 2000 and 2001 . It is owned and operated by the NASDAQ OMX Group , the stock of which was listed on its own stock exchange beginning July 2 , 2002 , under the ticker symbol . It is regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) . With the incomplete purchase of the Nordic-based operated exchange OMX , following its disagreement with Borse Dubai , NASDAQ is poised to capture 67 % of the controlling stake in the aforementioned exchange , thereby inching ever closer to taking over the company and creating a trans-atlantic powerhouse . The group , now known as Nasdaq-OMX , controls and operates the NASDAQ stock exchange in New York City â `` the second largest exchange in the United States . It also operates eight stock exchanges in Europe and holds one-third of the Dubai Stock Exchange . It has a double-listing agreement with OMX , and will compete with NYSE Euronext group in attracting new listings . When the NASDAQ stock exchange began trading on February 8 , 1971 , it was the world 's first electronic stock market . At first , it was merely a computer bulletin board system and did not actually connect buyers and sellers . The NASDAQ helped lower the spread ( the difference between the bid price and the ask price of the stock ) but somewhat paradoxically was unpopular among brokerages because they made much of their money on the spread . NASDAQ was the successor to the over-the-counter ( OTC ) system of trading . As late as 1987 , the NASDAQ exchange was still commonly referred to as the OTC in media and also in the monthly Stock Guides issued by Standard & Poor 's Corporation . Over the years , NASDAQ became more of a stock market by adding trade and volume reporting and automated trading systems . NASDAQ was also the first stock market in the United States to advertise to the general public , highlighting NASDAQ-traded companies ( usually in technology ) and closing with the declaration that NASDAQ is `` the stock market for the next hundred years . '' Its main index is the NASDAQ Composite , which has been published since its inception . However , its exchange-traded fund tracks the large-cap NASDAQ-100 index , which was introduced in 1985 alongside the NASDAQ 100 Financial Index . Until 1987 , most trading occurred via the telephone , but during the October 1987 stock market crash , market makers often did n't answer their phones . To counteract this , the Small Order Execution System ( SOES ) was established , which provides an electronic method for dealers to enter their trades . NASDAQ requires market makers to honor trades over SOES . In 1992 , it joined with the London Stock Exchange to form the first intercontinental linkage of securities markets . NASD spun off NASDAQ in 2000 to form a publicly traded company , the NASDAQ Stock Market , Inc. In 2006 NASDAQ changed from stock market to licensed national exchange . On November 8 , 2007 , NASDAQ bought the Philadelphia Stock Exchange ( PHLX ) for US$ 652 million . PHLX is the oldest stock exchange in Americaâ '' having been in operation since 1790 . To qualify for listing on the exchange , a company must be registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , have at least three market makers ( financial firms that act as brokers or dealers for specific securities ) and meet minimum requirements for assets , capital , public shares , and shareholders . In February , 2011 , in the wake of an announced merger of NYSE Euronext with Deutsche BÃ rse , speculation developed that Nasdaq and IntercontinentalExchange ( ICE ) could mount a counter-bid of their own for NYSE . Nasdaq could be looking to acquire the American exchange 's cash equities business , ICE the derivatives business . As of the time of the speculation , `` NYSE Euronextâ s market value was $ 9.75 billion . Nasdaq was valued at $ 5.78 billion , while ICE was valued at $ 9.45 billion . '' Late in the month , Nasdaq was reported to be considering asking either ICE or the Chicago Merc to join in what would be probably have to be , if it proceeded , an $ 11-12 billion counterbid . EASDAQ ( European Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotation System ) was a European electronic securities exchange headquartered in Brussels . Founded originally as a European equivalent to NASDAQ , it was purchased by NASDAQ in 2001 and became NASDAQ Europe . In 2003 , it shut down operations as a result of the burst of the dot-com bubble . In 2007 , NASDAQ Europe was revived as Equiduct and is currently operating under BÃ rse Berlin . NASDAQ has a pre-market session from 7:00 am to 9:30 am , a normal trading session from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm and a post-market session from 4:00 pm to 8:00 pm ( all times in ET ) .

Populus section Aegiros is a section of three species in the genus Populus , the poplars . Commonly known as cottonwood , the species are native to North America , Europe and western Asia . In the past , as many as six species were recognized , but recent trends have been to accept just three species , treating the others as subspecies of P. deltoides . They are large deciduous trees 20 â `` 45 m tall , distinguished by thick , deeply fissured bark and triangular-based to diamond-shaped leaves that are green on both sides ( without the whitish wax on the undersides of balsam poplar leaves ) and without any obvious balsam scent in spring . An important feature of the leaves is the petiole , which is flattened sideways so that the leaves have a particular type of movement in the wind . Male and female flowers are in separate catkins , appearing before the leaves in spring . The seeds are borne on cottony structures that allow them to be blown long distances in the air before settling to ground . The cottonwoods are exceptionally tolerant of flooding , erosion and flood deposits filling around the trunk . Although each of the three cottonwood species has a different leaf pattern , they all have the same general diamond leaf shape . Populus deltoides ( Eastern Cottonwood ) is one of the largest North American hardwood trees , although the wood is rather soft . It is a riparian zone tree . It occurs throughout the eastern United States and in extreme southern Canada . The leaves are alternate and simple , with coarsely-toothed ( crenate\/serrate ) edges , and subcordate at the base . The leaf shape is roughly triangular , hence the species name , deltoides . In the typical subspecies deltoides ( Vermont south to northern Florida and west to about Michigan ) , the leaves are broad and triangular , 7 â `` 15 cm across at the base . Further west ( Minnesota south to eastern Texas ) , the subspecies monilifera ( Plains Cottonwood ; syn . P. sargentii ) has somewhat narrower leaves 5 â `` 10 cm wide at the base . This is also the state tree of Nebraska , Wyoming , and Kansas . In western Texas , New Mexico , and Colorado , the subspecies wislizeni ( Rio Grande Cottonwood ; syn . P. wislizeni ) occurs . Populus fremontii ( Fremont cottonwood ) occurs in California east to Utah and Arizona and south into northwest Mexico ; it is similar to Eastern Cottonwood , differing mainly in the leaves ' having fewer , larger serrations on the edge , and small differences in the flower and seed pod structure . Populus nigra ( Black Poplar ) , native to Europe and western Asia , is distinct in its much smaller leaves , 5 â `` 11 cm across , with a more rhombic ( diamond ) shape ; see the link for further details . Cottonwoods are widely grown for timber production along wet river banks , where their exceptional growth rate provides a large crop of wood within just 10 â `` 30 years . The wood is coarse and of fairly low value , used for pallet boxes , shipping crates and similar purposes where a cheap but strong enough wood is suitable . They are also widely grown as screens and shelterbelts . Many of the cottonwoods grown commercially are the hybrid of Eastern Cottonwood and Black Poplar , Populus Ã -- canadensis ( Hybrid Black Poplar or Carolina Poplar ) . In the West , a variant known as Hybrid Cottonwood is also grown . Cottonwood bark is often a favorite medium for artisans . The bark , which is usually harvested in the fall after a tree 's death , is generally very soft and easy to carve . Cottonwood is one of the poorest woods to use as wood fuel . It does not dry well , and rots quickly . It splits poorly , because it is very fibrous . It produces a low level of BTUs per cord of wood . Cottonwoods serve as food for the caterpillars of several Lepidoptera ( see list of Lepidoptera that feed on poplars ) .
Canopic jars were used by the Ancient Egyptians during the mummification process to store and preserve the viscera of their owner for the afterlife . They were commonly either carved from limestone or were made of pottery . These jars were used by Ancient Egyptians from the time of the Old Kingdom up until the time of the Late Period or the Ptolemaic Period , by which time the viscera were simply wrapped and placed with the body . All the viscera were not kept in a single canopic jar , but rather each organ was placed in a jar of its own . The name ` canopic ' reflects the mistaken association by early Egyptologists with the Greek legend of Canopus . The jars were four in number , each charged with the safekeeping of particular human organs : the stomach , intestines , lungs , and liver . The design of these changed over time . In the Old Kingdom the jars had plain lids , though by the First Intermediate Period jars with human heads ( assumed to represent the dead ) began to appear . This practice continued up until the time of the New Kingdom , though by the late Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt the human heads were replaced by heads associated with the four sons of Horus , who were also the gods of the cardinal compass points . Each god was responsible for protecting a particular organ , and were themselves protected by companion goddesses from harm . They were : The canopic jars were placed inside a canopic chest and buried in tombs together with the sarcophagus of the dead . It was also done because it was believed the dead person would need their organs to help them through the after life . The Egyptians considered the heart to be the seat of the soul so it was left inside the body instead of being placed in a canopic jar . The Ancient Egyptians believed that in the afterlife the heart would be weighed against the feather of ma ` at ( truth ) by the god Anubis . If it was too heavy from bad deeds it would be fed to the monster Ammit . Sometimes the covers of the jars were modeled after ( or painted to resemble ) the head of Anubis , the god of death\/embalming . Copious numbers of the jars were produced , and surviving examples of them can be seen in museums all over the world .
Archaeology or archÃ ology or sometimes in American English archeology ( from the Greek words Î Ï Ï Î Î Î Ï = ancient and Î '' Ï Î Î Ï = word\/speech\/discourse ) is the study of human cultures through the recovery , documentation and analysis of cultural and environmental data , including architecture , artifacts , biofacts , human remains , and landscapes . The goals of archaeology are to document and explain the origins and development of human culture , culture history , cultural evolution , and human behavior and ecology . It is the only discipline that possesses the method and theory for the collection and interpretation of information about the pre-written human past , and can also make a critical contribution to our understanding of documented societies .

Many TCP\/IP software stack implementations provide options to use hardware assistance to automatically compute the checksum in the network adapter prior to transmission onto the network or upon reception from the network for validation . A monologue ( or monolog ) is when the character may be speaking his or her thoughts aloud , directly addressing another character , or speaking to the audience , especially the former . Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media ( plays , films , animation , etc. ) . It is distinct from a soliloquy , which is where a character relates his or her thoughts and feelings to him\/herself and to the audience without addressing any of the other characters . It is also distinct from an apostrophe , wherein the speaker or writer addresses an imaginary person , or inanimate object , or idea . The term `` monologue '' was actually used to describe a form of popular narrative verse , sometimes comic , often dramatic or sentimental , which was performed in music halls or in domestic entertainments in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century . Characters would break out , announcing their thoughts to themselves . Famous examples include Idylls of the King , The Green Eye of the Little Yellow God and Christmas Day in the Workhouse . The comic monologue has evolved into a regular feature of stand-up and television comedy .

Instrumentation is defined as the art and science of measurement and control . An instrument is a device that measures and\/or regulates process variables such as flow , temperature , level , or pressure . Instruments include many varied contrivances which can be as simple as valves and transmitters , and as complex as analyzers . Instruments often comprise control systems of varied processes such as refineries , factories , and vehicles . The control of processes is one of the main branches of applied instrumentation . Instrumentation can also refer to handheld devices that measure some desired variable . Diverse handheld instrumentation is common in laboratories , but can be found in the household as well . For example , a smoke detector is a common instrument found in most western homes . Output instrumentation includes devices such as solenoids , valves , regulators , circuit breakers , and relays . These devices control a desired output variable , and provide either remote or automated control capabilities . These are often referred to as final control elements when controlled remotely or by a control system . Transmitters are devices which produce an output signal , often in the form of a 4 -- 20 mA electrical current signal , although many other options using voltage , frequency , pressure , or ethernet are possible . This signal can be used for informational purposes , or it can be sent to a PLC , DCS , SCADA system , or other type of computerized controller , where it can be interpreted into readable values and used to control other devices and processes in the system . Control Instrumentation plays a significant role in both gathering information from the field and changing the field parameters , and as such are a key part of control loops . In the early years of process control , process indicators and control elements such as valves were monitored by an operator that walked around the unit adjusting the valves to obtain the desired temperatures , pressures , and flows . As technology evolved pneumatic controllers were invented and mounted in the field that monitored the process and controlled the valves . This reduced the amount of time process operators were needed to monitor the process . Later years the actual controllers were moved to a central room and signals were sent into the control room to monitor the process and outputs signals were sent to the final control element such as a valve to adjust the process as needed . These controllers and indicators were mounted on a wall called a control board . The operators stood in front of this board walking back and forth monitoring the process indicators . This again reduced the number and amount of time process operators were needed to walk around the units . The basic air signal used during these years was 3-15 psig . In the 1970s electronic instrumentation began to be manufactured by the instrument companies . Each instrument company came out with their own standard signal for their instrumentation , 10-50ma , 0.25-1 .25 Volts , 0-10Volts , 1-5volts , and 4-20ma , causing only confusion until the 4-20ma was universally used as a standard electronic instrument signal for transmitters and valves . The transformation of instrumentation from mechanical pneumatic transmitters , controllers , and valves to electronic instruments reduced maintenance costs as electronic instruments were more dependable than mechanical instruments . This also increased efficiency and production due to their increase in accuracy . The next evolution of instrumentation came with the production of Distributed Control Systems ( DCS ) . The pneumatic and electronic control rooms allowed control from a centralized room , DCS systems allowed control from more than one room or control stations . These stations could be next to each other or miles away . Now a process operator could sit in front of a screen and monitor thousands of points throughout a large unit or complex . Instrumentation is used to measure many parameters ( physical values ) . These parameters include : In addition to measuring field parameters , instrumentation is also responsible for providing the ability to modify some field parameters . Instrumentation engineering is the engineering specialization focused on the principle and operation of measuring instruments which are used in design and configuration of automated systems in electrical , pneumatic domains etc. . They typically work for industries with automated processes , such as chemical or manufacturing plants , with the goal of improving system productivity , reliability , safety , optimization , and stability . To control the parameters in a process or in a particular system , devices such as microprocessors , microcontrollers or PLCs are used , but their ultimate aim is to control the parameters of a system . Instrumentation technologists , technicians and mechanics specialize in troubleshooting and repairing and maintenance of instruments and instrumentation systems . This trade is so intertwined with electricians , pipefitters , power engineers , and engineering companies , that one can find him\/herself in extremely diverse working situations .
The only exception to this rule is when a game has been ported from the arcade directly to the Wii . The Wii Balance Board is a balance board accessory for the Nintendo Wii video game console . Along with Wii Fit , it was introduced on July 11 , 2007 at the Electronic Entertainment Expo . The Wii Balance Board is shaped like a household body scale , with a plain white top and light gray bottom . It runs on four AA batteries as a power source , which can power the board for about 60 hours . The board uses Bluetooth technology and contains multiple pressure sensors that are used to measure the user 's center of balanceâ '' the location of the intersection between an imaginary line drawn vertically through the center of mass and the surface of the Balance Boardâ '' and weight . In an interview conducted by gaming web site IGN , Shigeru Miyamoto stated that the Balance Board 's ability to measure weight is probably more accurate than that of a typical bathroom scale . Although the Japanese packaging states that it is designed to support people weighing up to 136 kilograms ( 300 pounds ) and the `` Western '' Balance Board up to 150 kg ( 330 pounds ) , they are actually the same board . The packaging differs due to regulatory differences between Japan and the United States . The sensors on the board can accurately measure up to 150 kg ( 330 pounds ) . The actual physical structure of the board can withstand much greater force equivalent to around 300 kg ( 660 pounds ) . Due to the similarities between the two products , the Wii Balance Board has been compared to the Joyboard , a peripheral released for the Atari VCS in 1982 by Amiga Corporation . The technology in the Joyboard was of course less advanced than that in the Wii Balance Board . It is noted in the manual that the Balance Board should only be used on a hard surface or thin carpet , as thicker or softer surfaces may cause the board to operate incorrectly . A set of foot extensions is included to allow the board to be used on softer surfaces . The extension feet are not included in the European versions of the balance board but may be purchased separately . The balance board should be used barefooted . Socks do not properly grip the hard surface and can be dangerous . Members of Club Nintendo were able to receive novelty Wii Fit non-skid socks , which use small rubber pads that stick to surfaces . The balance board 's development was tightly coupled with the development of the Wii Fit game . Nintendo initially contacted manufacturers of normal bathroom scales , but ended up building the board without their help in an effort to keep down costs . In early development models , the balance board was a simple scale with one pressure sensor . However , the developers realized that a simple scale was not useful as a game accessory and expanded the number of pressure sensors to two , then four . The idea to use multiple sensors was partly inspired by how sumo wrestlers weigh themselves ( using two scales ) . The shape of the balance board was initially a square , but it was decided that it was too hard to use for the exercises . For a large part of the development process , the board was an extension controller to a normal Wii remote . The effects of this are seen in the released balance board , which acts as a Wii remote with the front button mapped to `` A '' and all pressure sensors on an `` extension controller '' . Wii Fit was the first game to make use of the Wii Balance Board . Shigeru Miyamoto noted the potential for other uses , however , noting that `` probably the simplest and most straightforward ( idea ) would be a snowboarding game '' . Miyamoto has also stated that Nintendo has received `` many inquiries '' from third parties following the announcement of Wii Fit and the Wii Balance Board , as well as receiving interest from the physical fitness industry . We Ski by Namco Bandai Games was the first third-party game to make use of the Wii Balance Board , in conjunction with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment . Only one Balance Board can be synchronized with the Wii at a time and the board uses the fourth player controller connection , replacing any Wii Remotes that are currently bound to that position .
Nickel ( II ) sulfate , or just nickel sulfate , usually refers to the chemical compound with the formula NiSO4 . This highly soluble blue-coloured salt is a common source of the Ni2 + ion for electroplating . Several sulfate salts of nickel ( II ) are known , all being paramagnetic . These salts differ with respect to their hydration or subtle structural details . The common tetragonal hexahydrate crystallizes from aqueous solution between 30.7 and 53.8 Â C. Below these temperatures , a heptahydrate crystallises and above these temperatures an orthorhombic hexahydrate forms . The yellow anhydrous form , NiSO4 , is a high melting solid . This material produced by heating the hydrates above 330 Â C. It decomposes at still higher temperatures to nickel oxide . X-ray crystallography measurements show that NiSO4 Â 6H2O consists of octahedral ( Ni ( H2O ) 6 ) 2 + ions . These ions in turn are hydrogen bonded to sulfate ions . Dissolution of the salt in water gives solutions containing the ion ( Ni ( H2O ) 6 ) 2 + . The salt is usually obtained by dissolution of nickel metal or nickel oxides in sulfuric acid . Approximately 10,000 tonnes were produced in 2005 . It is mainly used for electroplating of nickel . Aqueous solutions of nickel sulfate reacts with sodium carbonate to precipitate nickel carbonate , a precursor to nickel-based catalysts and pigments . Addition of ammonium sulfate to concentrated aqueous solutions of nickel sulfate precipitates Ni ( NH4 ) 2SO4 Â 6H2O . This blue-coloured solid is analogous to Mohr 's salt , Fe ( NH4 ) 2SO4 Â 6H2O . Nickel sulfate is used in the laboratory . Columns used in polyhistidine-tagging , useful in biochemistry and molecular biology , are regenerated with nickel sulfate . Aqueous solutions of NiSO4 Â 6H2O and related hydrates react with ammonia to give ( Ni ( NH3 ) 6 ) SO4 and with ethylenediamine to give ( Ni ( H2NCH2CH2NH2 ) 3 ) SO4 . The latter is occasionally used as a calibrant for magnetic susceptibility measurements because it has no tendency to hydrate . Nickel sulfate occurs as the rare mineral retgersite , which is a hexahydrate . The second hexahydrate is known as nickelhexahydrite ( Ni , Mg , Fe ) SO4 Â 6H2O . The heptahydrate , which is relatively unstable in air , occurs as morenosite . The monohydrate occurs as very rare mineral dwornikite ( Ni , Fe ) SO4 Â H2O . Nickel salts are carcinogenic and irritate the skin .

A head tie is a west and southern African womenâ s cloth head scarf . It is known as a ` Duku ' ( Malawi , Ghana ) , ` Dhuku ' ( Zimbabwe ) and ` Gele ' ( Nigeria ) . The head scarf is used specifically ornamental head covering or fashion accessory or for functionality in different settings . Its uses or meaning can vary depending on the country and\/or religion . In Ghana opportunity to wear a duku usually falls on a religious day of Friday , Saturday or Sunday depending on if they are Muslim , Seventh-Day Adventists or Sunday church-going Christians . Malawi head tie are usually small and conservative relative to the Nigerian style . They are worn down at weddings and at funerals . At celebrations like weddings , ceremonies , and formal parties , they are worn upwards . In addition , they are worn to sleep to protect the hair . In Nigeria they are known as Gele , and can be rather elaborate in size . Most Nigerian head ties are large and colorful . In the church setting , women may wear white Dukus to cover their heads . At the International Pentecostal churches in South Africa , married women wear white Dukus . The Shangaan women in Zimbabwe and South Africa wear Dukus as accessories . At other social gatherings , women may wear a Dhuku .

Laksa is a popular spicy noodle soup from the Peranakan culture , which is a merger of Chinese and Malay elements found in Malaysia and Singapore , and to a lesser extent Indonesia . The origin of the name `` laksa '' is unclear . One theory traces it back to Hindi\/Persian lakhshah , referring to a type of vermicelli , which in turn may be derived from the Sanskrit lakshas ( à à à à à ) meaning `` one hundred thousand '' ( lakh ) . It has also been suggested that `` laksa '' may derive from the Chinese word è 3\/4 # æ , meaning `` spicy sand '' due to the ground dried prawns which gives a sandy or gritty texture to the sauce . The last theory is that the name comes from the similar sounding word `` dirty '' in Hokkien due to its appearance . There are two basic types of laksa : curry laksa and asam laksa . Curry laksa is a coconut curry soup with noodles , while asam laksa is a sour fish soup with noodles . Thick rice noodles also known as laksa noodles are most commonly used , although thin rice vermicelli ( bee hoon or mee hoon ) are also common and some variants use other types . Curry laksa ( in many places referred to simply as â laksaâ ) is a coconut-based curry soup . The main ingredients for most versions of curry laksa include tofu puffs , fish sticks , shrimp and cockles . Some vendors may sell chicken laksa . Laksa is commonly served with a spoonful of sambal chilli paste and garnished with Vietnamese coriander , or laksa leaf , which is known in Malay as daun kesum . This is usually known as `` Curry mee '' in Penang rather than curry laksa , due to the different kind of noodles used ( yellow mee or bee hoon , as opposed to the thick white laksa noodles ) . Curry Mee in Penang uses congealed pork blood , a delicacy to the Malaysian Chinese community . Two of the well known places to try curry mee is at Lorong Seratus Tahun and Chulia Street . The term `` Curry laksa '' is more commonly used in Kuala Lumpur or Singapore . Laksa is popular in Singapore and Malaysia , as are laksa yong tau foo , lobster laksa , and even plain laksa , with just noodles and gravy . Asam laksa is a sour fish-based soup . Asam ( or asam jawa ) is the Malay word for tamarind , which is commonly used to give the stock its sour flavor . It is also common to use `` asam keping '' also known as `` asam gelugor '' , dried slices of tamarind fruit , for added sourness . Modern Malay spelling is asam , though the spelling assam is still frequently used . The main ingredients for asam laksa include shredded fish , normally kembung fish or mackerel , and finely sliced vegetables including cucumber , onions , red chillies , pineapple , lettuce , common mint , `` daun kesum '' ( Vietnamese mint or laksa mint ) and pink bunga kantan ( ginger buds ) . Asam laksa is normally served with either thick rice noodles or thin rice noodles ( vermicelli ) . And topped off with `` petis udang '' or `` hae ko '' ( è ç 3\/4 '' ) , a thick sweet prawn\/shrimp paste . Several variants mix together coconut milk and fish and can be identified as either curry or asam laksa . Laksa is simply referred to or ordered at a restaurant as laksa ( curry laksa ) or asam laksa . By default , laksa means the standard curry laksa while asam laksa refers to the standard Penang version . If a restaurant serves a non-standard version , the restaurant will qualify the laksa by the version being sold . For example , a restaurant serving Katong laksa will list Katong laksa on the menu . Laksa paste to cook laksa can be purchased from supermarkets . Laksa flavored instant noodles are also available at supermarkets .
In agriculture , the harvest is the process of gathering mature crops from the fields . Reaping is the cutting of grain or pulse for harvest , typically using a scythe , sickle , or reaper . The harvest marks the end of the growing season , or the growing cycle for a particular crop , and this is the focus of seasonal celebrations of many religions . On smaller farms with minimal mechanization , harvesting is the most labor-intensive activity of the growing season . On large , mechanized farms , harvesting utilizes the most expensive and sophisticated farm machinery , like the combine harvester . Harvesting in general usage includes an immediate post-harvest handling , all of the actions taken immediately after removing the cropâ '' cooling , sorting , cleaning , packingâ '' up to the point of further on-farm processing , or shipping to the wholesale or consumer market . Harvest timing is a critical decision , that balances the likely weather conditions with the degree of crop maturity . Weather conditions such as frost , rain ( resulting in a `` wet harvest '' ) , and unseasonably warm or cold periods can affect yield and quality . An earlier harvest date may avoid damaging conditions , but result in poorer yield and quality . Delaying harvest may result in a better harvest , but increases the risk of weather problems . Timing of the harvest often amounts to a significant gamble . Before the 16th century , harvest was the term usually used to refer to the Autumn season : in fact the word comes from old English hÃ rfest , which meant Autumn ( the German word Herbst has the same origin and still means Autumn ) . The word is a compound word ( hÃ r + fest ) and its first part has Indo-European roots in \* kerp meaning to gather , pluck , harvest . Compare it with the Latin verb carpere meaning to cut , divide , pluck ( Carpe diem ) . So hÃ rfest indicated originally the joyful celebration of finally being possible to gather the mature crops ; it extended afterwards its meaning to the all period beginning with the harvest ( autumn ) . Recall also the expression harvest moon which is recorded since 1706 and indicates the full moon within a fortnight of the autumnal equinox ( 21 of September ) . However , as more people gradually moved from working the land to living in towns ( especially those who were literate ) , the word came to refer to the actual activity of reaping , rather than the time of year , and the terms Fall and Autumn began to replace it in the latter sense . The word harvest commonly refers to grain and produce , but also has other uses . In addition to fish and timber , the term harvest is also used in reference to harvesting grapes for wine . Within the context of irrigation , water harvesting refers to the collection and run-off of rainwater for agricultural or domestic uses . Instead of harvest , the term exploit is also used , as in exploiting fisheries or water resources . Energy harvesting is the process by which energy ( such as solar power , thermal energy , wind energy , salinity gradients and kinetic energy ) is captured and stored . Body harvesting , or cadaver harvesting , is the process of collecting and preparing cadavers for anatomical study . In a similar sense , organ harvesting is the removal of tissues or organs from a donor for purposes of transplanting .
Raymond Moody ( born June 30 , 1944 ) is a psychologist and medical doctor . He is most famous as an author of books about life after death and near-death experiences ( NDE ) , a term that he coined in 1975 . His best-selling title is Life After Life . Moody studied philosophy at the University of Virginia , United States , where he obtained a B.A. ( 1966 ) , an M.A. ( 1967 ) and a Ph. . D ( 1969 ) in the subject . He also obtained a Ph. . D in psychology from the University of West Georgia , then known as West Georgia College , where he later became a professor in that topic . In 1976 , he was awarded an M.D. from the Medical College of Georgia . In 1998 Moody was appointed Chair in Consciousness Studies at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas . After obtaining his M.D. , Moody worked as a forensic psychiatrist in a maximum-security Georgia state hospital . Moody has been married three times . As of 2004 , he is married to Cheryl , and they have one adopted son , Carter , and one adopted daughter , CarolAnne . Moody was born in Porterdale , Georgia and currently lives in rural Alabama . In an interview in 1993 , Moody stated he was placed in a mental hospital by his family for his work with mirror gazing . Moody 's most famous book was made into a movie of the same name , Life After Life , for which he won a bronze medal in the Human Relations Category at the New York Film Festival . He was also awarded the World Humanitarian Award . His much later book The Last Laugh , containing , as he states , material edited out of Life After Life , confused some of his admirers as to his own personal view of NDE phenomena , which he had done so much to publicize . In this book , he says he does not consider them to be conclusive proof of life after death , and is disturbed by the use of his works by religious fundamentalists and New Age gurus to further their causes . `` I do n't mind saying that after talking with over a thousand people who have had these experiences , and having experienced many times some of the really baffling and unusual features of these experiences , it has given me great confidence that there is a life after death . As a matter of fact , I must confess to you in all honesty , I have absolutely no doubt , on the basis of what my patients have told me , that they did get a glimpse of the beyond . '' The Dr. John Dee Memorial Theater of the Mind is a research institute in Alabama that was founded by Moody as a place where people can experience an altered state of consciousness with the intention of invoking apparitions of the dead . One of the methods used to obtain this altered state is crystallomancy , or `` mirror gazing '' . Moody has also researched past life regression and believes that he personally has had nine past lives . From a study of 150 people who had clinically died or almost died , Moody concluded that there are nine experiences common to most people who have had a near death experience . These are :
Borna is a town in the Free State of Saxony , Germany , capital of the Leipzig district . It is situated approx . 25 km southeast of Leipzig . It has approx . 22,500 inhabitants , it is also a popular Persian name which was first introduced by the great poet Ferdousi which means healthy and young . Borna as a town is more than 750 years old . Modern history of Borna was enriched with the story of transporting the church from the neighboring Heuersdorf to Borna . Late October 2007 the 14th century romanesque building of Emmaus Church in Heuersdorf ( 12 km or 7mil from Borna ) was cut from the ground and relocated in Martin Luther Square of Borna . `` Borna '' was an old Persian name which is still commonly used . It represents youth and youngness and pride .
A material safety data sheet ( MSDS ) is a form with data regarding the properties of a particular substance . An important component of product stewardship and workplace safety , it is intended to provide workers and emergency personnel with procedures for handling or working with that substance in a safe manner , and includes information such as physical data ( melting point , boiling point , flash point , etc. ) , toxicity , health effects , first aid , reactivity , storage , disposal , protective equipment , and spill-handling procedures . MSDS formats can vary from source to source within a country depending on national requirements . MSDS ( material safety data sheets ) are a widely used system for cataloging information on chemicals , chemical compounds , and chemical mixtures . MSDS information may include instructions for the safe use and potential hazards associated with a particular material or product . These data sheets can be found anywhere where chemicals are being used . There is also a duty to properly label substances on the basis of physico-chemical , health and\/or environmental risk . Labels can include hazard symbols such as the European Union standard black diagonal cross on an orange background , used to denote a harmful substance . An MSDS for a substance is not primarily intended for use by the general consumer , focusing instead on the hazards of working with the material in an occupational setting . In some jurisdictions the MSDS is required to state the chemical 's risks , safety , and effect on the environment . It is important to use an MSDS specific to both country and supplier , as the same product ( e.g. paints sold under identical brand names by the same company ) can have different formulations in different countries . The formulation and hazard of a product using a generic name ( e.g. sugar soap ) may vary between manufacturers in the same country . In Canada the program known as the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System ( WHMIS ) establishes the requirements for MSDSs in workplaces and is administered federally by Health Canada under the Hazardous Products Act , Part II , and the Controlled Products Regulations . WHMIS and MSDS requirements are also enforced by provincial Ministries or Departments of Labor . The European Union ( EU ) requires that Risk and Safety Statements ( R - and S-phrases ) and a symbol appear on each label and safety data sheet for hazardous chemicals . The German Federal Water Management Act requires that substances be evaluated for negative influence on the physical , chemical or biological characteristics of water . These are classified into numeric water hazard classes ( WGK or WHC depending whether you use the German or English abbreviation ) . Dutch Safety Data Sheets are well known as veiligheidsinformatieblad : nl : Veiligheidsinformatieblad or Chemiekaarten . This is a collection of Safety Data Sheets of the most widely used chemicals . The Chemiekaarten boek is commercially available , but also made available through educational institutes , such as the web site offered by the university of Groningen In the U.K. , the Chemicals ( Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply ) Regulations 2002 - known as CHIP Regulations - impose duties upon suppliers , and importers into the EU , of hazardous materials . The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health ( COSHH ) Regulations govern the use of hazardous substances in the workplace in the UK and specifically require an assessment of the use of a substance . Regulation 12 requires that an employer provides employees with information , instruction and training for people exposed to hazardous substances . This duty would be very nearly impossible without the data sheet as a starting point . It is important for employers therefore to insist on receiving a data sheet from a supplier of a substance . The duty to supply information is not confined to informing only business users of products . MSDSs are now commonly available to anyone using the web sites of manufacturers and large retail suppliers as well as by written or telephone requests for paper copies . In the U.S. , the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires that MSDS be available to employees for potentially harmful substances handled in the workplace under the Hazard Communication regulation . The MSDS is also required to be made available to local fire departments and local and state emergency planning officials under Section 311 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act . The American Chemical Society defines Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Numbers ( CAS numbers ) which provide a unique number for each chemical and are also used internationally in MSDSs . Many companies offer the service of collecting , or writing and revising , data sheets to ensure they are up to date and available for their subscribers or users . Some jurisdictions impose an explicit duty of care that each MSDS be regularly updated ( usually every three to five years ) .

A cartoonist is a person who specializes in drawing cartoons . Much of this work is humorous , usually created for entertainment , political commentary or advertising . Throughout the 20th century , cartoons were widely published in print media of various kinds , featured in magazines such as The New Yorker and Punch and distributed to newspapers through such organizations as King Features Syndicate . Today , both original cartoons and vintage cartoons can be found online . Cartoonists may work in many different formats : single-panel gag cartoons , editorial cartoons , comic strips , comic books , graphic novels , video game packaging , booklets , manuals , or animation . A cartoonist traditionally developed rough sketches into finished pencil drawings and then , for reproduction purposes , completed the artwork in black India ink , using either a brush or a metal-nibbed pen . Many favored a Winsor & Newton # 3 , Series 7 brush used in combination with a crowquill pen . Today , cartoonists increasingly work in digital media . To illustrate the Blondie comic strip , the cartoonist John Marshall works directly on a Wacom tablet connected to his Macintosh computer . The English satirist and editorial cartoonist William Hogarth , who emerged In the 18th century , has been credited with pioneering Western sequential art . His work ranged from realistic portraiture to comic strip-like series of pictures called `` modern moral subjects '' . Much of his work poked fun at contemporary politics and customs ; illustrations in such style are often referred to as `` Hogarthian '' . During the 20th century , numerous magazines carried single-panel gag cartoons by such freelance cartoonists as Charles Addams , Irwin Caplan , Chon Day , Clyde Lamb and John Norment . These were almost always published in black and white , although Collier 's often carried cartoons in color . The debut of Playboy introduced full-page color cartoons by Jack Cole , Eldon Dedini and others . Single-panel cartoonists syndicated to newspapers included Dave Breger , Hank Ketcham , George Lichty , Fred Neher , Irving Phillips and J. R. Williams . Comic strips received widespread distribution to mainstream newspapers by syndicates such as the Universal Press Syndicate , United Media or King Features . Sunday strips go to a coloring company such as American Color before they are published . Some comic strip creators publish in the alternative press or on the Internet . Comic strip artists may also sometimes work in book-length form , creating graphic novels . Both vintage and current strips receive reprints in book collections . The major comic book publishers ( such as Marvel or DC ) utilize teams of cartoonists to produce the art ( typically separating pencil work , inking and lettering while the color is added digitally by colorists ) . When a consistent artistic style is wanted among different cartoonists ( such as Archie Comics ) , character model sheets may be used as reference . Calum MacKenzie , in his preface to the exhibition catalog , The Scottish Cartoonists , published in 1979 by the Glasgow Print Studio Gallery , defined the selection criteria : The difference between a cartoonist and an illustrator was the same as the difference between a comedian and a comedy actor -- the former both deliver their own lines and take full responsibility for them , the latter could always hide behind the fact that it was not his entire creation . Animated cartooning is created for short films , advertising , feature films and television . It is also sometimes used in live-action films for dream sequences or opening titles . An animation artist is commonly referred to as an animator rather than a cartoonist . There are many books of cartoons in both paperback and hardcover , notably the collections of cartoons from The New Yorker . Prior to the 1960s , cartoons were mostly ignored by museums and art galleries . In 1968 , the cartoonist and comedian Roger Price opened the first New York City gallery devoted exclusively to cartoons , mainly work by the leading magazine gag cartoonists . Today , there are several museums devoted to cartoons , notably the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum , run by curator Jenny E. Robb at Ohio State University .

Pepperoni is a spicy food Italian-American variety of salami ( a dry sausage ) usually made from cured pork and beef , but poultry may be added , if labeled correctly , for less expensive versions . It is a descendant of the spicy salamis of southern Italy , such as salsiccia Napoletana piccante , a spicy dry sausage from Naples or the soppressata from Calabria . Pepperoni is a popular pizza topping in American-style pizzerias . Also , it is sometimes used to make sub sandwiches . The term pepperoni is a corruption of peperoni , the plural of peperone , the Italian word for pepper . To order in Italy a very similar food to what in America is called `` pepperoni '' one would request salamino piccante to get the spicy sausage ( but made only of pork beef , and never with meat from other animals as in the american version ) . Usually the Italian name for a pepperoni pizza is pizza alla diavola ( pizza devil-style , very similar in appearance to the pepperoni pizza ) . Asking for a pizza with `` salame piccante calabro '' or `` spianata calabra '' ( hot salami typical of Calabria , generally made in large cylinders of meat , slightly flattened in the case `` spianata '' ) one could get a pizza covered with large slices of salami instead of the slices of hot sausage . Original salami from Calabria can be much more spicy than american pepperoni or other types italian spicy sausages . Throughout continental Europe , peperone is a common word for various types of capsicum , including bell peppers and a small , spicy and often pickled pepper known as peperoncino or peperone piccante in Italy and pepperoncini or banana peppers in the U.S. Sodium nitrite , used as a curing agent , is what gives pepperoni the pink part of its distinct orange-pink color , while paprika or other capsicum provides the orange part . Unlike in Europe , the English word pepperoni is used as a singular uncountable noun . Halal or kosher pepperoni may be made from beef or poultry .

Sydney William Ward ( 5 August 1907 -- 31 December 2010 ) was an Australian-born New Zealand cricketer . Ward was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace . He was born at Sydney , New South Wales and , until his death , was considered the oldest living first-class cricketer and the second oldest ever behind Jim Hutchinson , who at the time of his death was 103 years and 344 days . Ward was born in Australia , but moved to New Zealand at some point prior to playing first-class cricket for Wellington . His first-class debut for Wellington came in the 1929\/30 Plunket Shield against Otago . From 1929\/30 to 1937\/38 , he represented Wellington in 10 first-class matches , with his final first-class match coming against Canterbury . In his 20 first-class matches , he scored 282 runs at a batting average of 14.84 , with a single half century high score of 61 , which came against Auckland in the 1934\/35 season .

Stan is the nickname given to a fossil of the dinosaur species Tyrannosaurus rex . It was found in Hell Creek Formation , South Dakota , close to Buffalo in 1987 by Stan Sacrison , who also discovered the Tyrannosaurus specimen nicknamed `` Duffy '' . The original fossils are now housed at Black Hills Institute of Geological Research , Inc. center . It is a well known specimen , and one of the most complete , with 199 bones recovered . About 30 casts of the original fossil has been sold worldwide , each for a price of about $ 100 000 . Stan measures 40.1 feet long , and 12 feet over the hips . Casts of Stanâ s skeleton can be found in many displays around the world . A cast can be found at Manchester Museum , and it has also been at the Children 's Museum of Indianapolis together with the Tyrannosaurus specimen `` Bucky '' and the Triceratops `` Kesley '' , as well as New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science and Houston Museum of Natural Science and at Disney World . Another cast is located at the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center . When BBC tested the power of Tyrannosaurus jaws in their program The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs ( 2005 ) , the hydraulic skull model was based on Stan . Gregory Erickson estimated the bite power , based on the power of a modern alligator , and came to the conclusion that Tyrannosaurus would have had a bite force of about 3 tonnes , or 40,000 Newtons . Stan has also been used for studies involving restoration of dinosaurs body mass and study on how they could have moved . Like many other fossils of Tyrannosaurus rex , the skeleton of Stan shows many broken and healed bones . These include broken ribs and damages in the skull . One of the most prominent injuries are in the neck and the skull . A piece of bone is missing at the rear , and the skull also bears a hole 1 inch wide , probably made by another Tyrannosaurus . Also , two of the cervical vertebrae are fused , and another has additional bone growth . This could have been caused by another Tyrannosaurus bite . The bite marks are healed , indicating that Stan survived the wounds . Stan could also have been infected by Trichomonas-like parasites .

A violent crime or crime of violence is a crime in which the offender uses or threatens to use violent force upon the victim . This entails both crimes in which the violent act is the objective , such as murder , as well as crimes in which violence is the means to an end , ( including criminal ends ) such as robbery . Violent crimes include crimes committed with and without weapons . With the exception of rape ( which accounts for 6 % of all reported violent crimes ) , males are the primary victims of all forms of violent crime . The comparison of violent crime statistics between countries is usually problematic , due to the way different countries classify crime . Valid comparisons require that similar offences between jurisdictions be compared . Often this is not possible because crime statistics aggregate equivalent offences in such different ways that make it difficult or impossible to obtain a valid comparison . The Australian Standard Offence Classification ( ASOC ) document published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics does not have a single category for violent crime . Rather , violent crime is classified under a number of different categories that often indicate a range of both violent and non-violent behavior . The categories include : Canada classifies homicides , attempted murder , all assaults , all sexual offences , abduction and robbery as violent crime . New Zealand 's crime statistics has a category for violence that includes homicides , kidnapping , abduction , robbery , assaults , intimidation , threats , and group assembly , while all sexual offences are shown in a separate category from violence . Includes all violence against the person , sexual offences , and robbery as violent crime . The United States Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics ( BJS ) counts five categories of crime as violent crimes : murder , forcible rape , robbery , aggravated assault , and simple assault . According to BJS figures , the rate of violent crime victimization in the United States declined by more than two thirds between the years 1994 and 2009 . 7.9 % of sentenced prisoners in federal prisons on September 30 , 2009 were in for violent crimes . 52.4 % of sentenced prisoners in state prisons at yearend 2008 were in for violent crimes . 21.6 % of convicted inmates in jails in 2002 ( latest available data by type of offense ) were in for violent crimes .

The New International Version is an English translation of the Christian Bible . Published by Zondervan in the United States , it has become one of the most popular modern translations in history . The New International Version project was started after a meeting in 1965 at Trinity Christian College in Palos Heights , Illinois , between the Christian Reformed Church , National Association of Evangelicals , and a group of international scholars . The New York Bible Society ( now Biblica ) was selected to do the translation . The New Testament was released in 1973 and the full Bible in 1978 . There are a couple of very rare 1973 editions which are signed by a few of the translating committee members which were released before the other 1973 editions . It underwent a minor revision in 1984 and another revision in 2011 . The manuscript base for the Old Testament was the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia Masoretic Hebrew Text . Other ancient texts consulted were the Dead Sea Scrolls , the Samaritan Pentateuch , the Aquila , Symmachus and Theodotion , the Latin Vulgate , the Syriac Peshitta , the Aramaic Targum , and for the Psalms the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome . The manuscript base of the NIV was the Koine Greek language editions of the United Bible Societies and of Nestle-Aland for the New Testament . The deuterocanonical books are not included in the translation . The core translation group consisted of fifteen Biblical scholars . The translation took ten years and involved a team of up to 100 scholars from the USA , Canada , the United Kingdom , Australia , New Zealand , and South Africa . The range of those participating included many different denominations such as Anglicans , Assemblies of God , Baptist , Christian Reformed , Lutheran , Presbyterian , etc. The translation is a balance between word-for-word and thought-for-thought . Recent archaeological and linguistic discoveries helped in understanding traditionally difficult passages to translate . Familiar spellings of traditional translations were generally retained . According to Zondervan , publisher of the NIV , the translation has become the most popular modern English translation of the Bible , having sold more than 215 million copies worldwide . It continues to be one of the top ten selling Bibles . There are numerous study Bibles available with extensive notes on the text and background information to make the Biblical stories more comprehensible . Among these are the NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible , the Zondervan published NIV Study Bible , the Wesleyan revision , Reflecting God Study Bible , as well as the Life Application Study Bible . Bruce M. Metzger criticizes the addition of just into Jeremiah 7:22 , so the verse becomes `` For when I brought your forefathers out of Egypt and spoke to them , I did not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices '' , an apparent attempt to harmonize with Exodus 20:24 . Metzger also criticizes the addition of your into Matthew 13:32 , so it becomes `` Though it ( the mustard seed ) is the smallest of all your seeds '' , avoiding any impression of Jesus speaking a botanical untruth . The your has been removed in the 2011 NIV revision .
The National Academies serve ( collectively ) as the scientific national academy for the United States ( US ) . The NAS , NAE , and IOM are honorary membership organizations , with a total membership of over 6,000 scientists , engineers , and health professionals . New members for each organization are elected annually by current members , based on their distinguished and continuing achievements in original research . The NRC is the `` working arm '' of the Academies , which serves to collect , analyze , and share information through studies and reports . The National Academies produce independent recommendations and policy reports by enlisting top scientists , engineers , health professionals , and other experts ( not limited to those in Academies membership ) to address the scientific and technical aspects of some of society 's problems . These experts volunteer to serve on study committees that are convened to answer specific sets of questions . All committee members serve without pay . The National Academies do not perform original research ; rather they provide independent advice . Federal agencies are the primary financial sponsors of the Academies ' work ; additional studies are funded by state agencies , foundations , other private sponsors , and the National Academies endowment . The external sponsors have no control over the conduct or results of a study , once the statement of task and budget are finalized . Study committees gather information from many sources in public meetings but deliberate in private in order to avoid political , special interest , and sponsor influence . Through this study process , the National Academies produce around 200 reports each year . Recent reports cover such topics as addressing the obesity epidemic , the use of forensics in the courtroom , invasive plants , pollinator collapse , underage drinking , the Hubble Telescope , vaccine safety , the hydrogen economy , transportation safety , climate change , and homeland security . Many reports influence policy decisions ; some are instrumental in enabling new research programs ; others provide independent program reviews . The US National Academy of Sciences was created by an Act of Incorporation in 1863 , which was signed by the President of the United States Abraham Lincoln . Under this congressional charter , the National Research Council was created in 1916 , the National Academy of Engineering in 1964 , and the Institute of Medicine in 1970 . The National Academies Press is the publisher for the National Academies , and makes its publications available for free online reading , as it has since 1994 , the first self-sustaining book publisher to do so . The National Academies also administer the Marian Koshland Science Museum .
However , the 1991 storm was significantly more destructive , causing 1.5 billion dollars in damage ( 2 billion inflation-adjusted ) compared to the 1970 storm 's 86.4 million dollars in damage ( inflation-adjusted : 480 million ) . The Snake River Plain is a geologic feature located primarily within the state of Idaho in the United States of America . It stretches about 400 m westward from northwest of the state of Wyoming to the Idaho-Oregon border . The plain is a wide flat bow-shaped depression , and covers about a quarter of Idaho . Three major buttes dot the plain east of Arco , the largest being Big Southern Butte . Many of Idaho 's major cities are in the Snake River Plain , as is much of its agricultural land . Also located within Snake River Plain is the Idaho National Laboratory . The Snake River Plain can be divided into three sections : western , central , and eastern . The western Snake River Plain is a large tectonic graben or rift valley filled with several km of lacustrine ( lake ) sediments ; the sediments are underlain by rhyolite and basalt , and overlain by basalt . The western plain began to form around 11-12 Ma with the eruption of rhyolite lavas and ignimbrites . The western plain is not parallel to North American Plate motion , and lies at a high angle to the central and eastern Snake River Plains . Its morphology is similar to other volcanic plateaus such as the Chilcotin Group in south-central British Columbia , Canada . The eastern Snake River plain traces the path of the North American plate over the Yellowstone hotspot , now centered in Yellowstone National Park . The eastern plain is a topographic depression that cuts across Basin and Range Mountain structures , more or less parallel to North American plate motion . It is underlain almost entirely by basalt erupted from large shield volcanoes . Beneath the basalts are rhyolite lavas and ignimbrites that erupted as the lithosphere passed over the hotspot . The central Snake River plain is similar to the eastern plain , but differs by having thick sections of interbedded lacustrine ( lake ) and fluvial ( stream ) sediments , including the Hagerman fossil beds . Island Park and Yellowstone Calderas formed as the result of enormous rhyolite ignimbrite eruptions , with single eruptions producing up to 2500 cubic km of ash . Island Park Caldera , measuring 18 m by 23 m , may be the largest symmetrical caldera in the world . The caldera formed when a dome of magma built up and then drained away . The center of the dome collapsed , leaving a caldera . The rim is visible in this image as a distinct ring of green in the satellite image . Younger volcanoes that erupted after passing over the hotspot covered the plain with young basalt lava flows in places , including Craters of the Moon National Monument . The Snake River Plain has a significant effect on the climate of Yellowstone National Park and the adjacent areas to the south and west of Yellowstone . As the Yellowstone hotspot burned its way across southern Idaho , it left a 70 m wide channel through the Rocky Mountains . This channel is in line with the gap between the Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada . The result is a moisture channel extending from the Pacific Ocean to Yellowstone . Moisture from the Pacific Ocean streams onshore in the form of clouds and humid air . It passes through the gap between the Sierra and Cascades and on into the Snake River Plain where it is channeled through most of the Rocky Mountains with no high plateaus nor mountain ranges to impede its progress . It finally encounters upslope conditions at the head of the Snake River Valley at Ashton , Idaho and at Island Park , Idaho , at the Teton Range east of Driggs , Idaho , and at the Yellowstone Plateau of Yellowstone National Park where the channeled moisture precipitates out as rain and snow . The result is a localized climate on the eastern side of the Rockies that is akin to a climate on the west slope of the Cascades or the northern Sierras . The head of the Snake River Valley , the Tetons , and the Yellowstone Plateau receive much more precipitation than other areas of the region and the area is known for being wet , green , having many streams , and having abundant snow in winter . The SRP has a high level of agricultural development and houses the majority of Idahoâ s population ; however , it also contains one of the United States ' greatest potential sources for renewable energy in the form of geothermal heat . The Snake River Plain ( SRP ) was formed from successive volcanic eruptions of the Yellowstone hotspot as it moved beneath the North American Plate from what is now Eastern Oregon to its current location in NW Wyoming . The basaltic plain that resulted still retains a large amount of surface-level heat flow ; it allows Idaho to be one of the 5 states in the USA that currently have functional geothermal electricity generation .

Year 18 ( XVIII ) was a common year starting on Saturday ( link will display the full calendar ) of the Julian calendar . At the time , it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Augustus and Caesar ( or , less frequently , year 771 Ab urbe condita ) . The denomination 18 for this year has been used since the early medieval period , when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years .
NFPA 704 is a standard maintained by the U.S.-based National Fire Protection Association . It defines the colloquial `` fire diamond '' used by emergency personnel to quickly and easily identify the risks posed by nearby hazardous materials . This is necessary to help determine what , if any , special equipment should be used , procedures followed , or precautions taken during the first moments of an emergency response . The four divisions are typically color-coded , with blue indicating level of health hazard , red indicating flammability , yellow ( chemical ) reactivity , and white containing special codes for unique hazards . Each of health , flammability and reactivity is rated on a scale from 0 ( no hazard ; normal substance ) to 4 ( severe risk ) . Note : These hazard symbols are not part of the NFPA 704 standard , but are occasionally used in an unofficial manner . The use of non-standard symbols or text may be permitted , required or disallowed by the authority having jurisdiction ( e.g. , fire department ) .
It had been rumored Renault were prepared to quit the sport at the end of the 2009 season had the team been heavily punished , but the FIA found Briatore and Symonds solely to blame and chose to suspend Renault 's ban . The Bucegi Mountains ( Romanian : MunÅ # ii Bucegi , Hungarian : Bucsecs-hegys Ã g ) are located in central Romania , south of the city BraÅ ov . They are part of the Southern Carpathians group of the Carpathian Mountains . To the east , the Bucegi Mountains have a very steep slope towards the popular tourist destination Prahova Valley ( a.o. BuÅ teni and Sinaia ) . At a higher elevation is the Bucegi Plateau , where wind and rain have turned the rocks into spectacular figures such as the Sphinx and Babele . The Bucegi is believed to be the Dacian holy mountain Kogainon , on which the mythical figure Zalmoxis resided in a cave .
Seizure response dogs are a special type of service dog , specifically trained to help someone who has epilepsy or a seizure disorder . Due to the differing needs between each case , every potential seizure dog receives specialized training . Tasks for seizure dogs may include , but are not limited to : Additionally , some dogs may develop the ability to sense an impending seizure . This behavior is usually reported to have arisen spontaneously and developed over a period of time . There have been some studies where dogs were trained to alert impending seizures by using reward-based conditioning â `` with partial success . Some untrained dogs may help their owners , although there are also reports of dogs that have reacted aggressively or even died as a result of witnessing or anticipating their owner 's seizure . Dogs that are and may become seizure response dogs must be absolutely perfect for the job , and must be capable of maintaining control in every possible situation . Because of the rarity of these certain traits and the difficulty in training seizure response dogs , only a few organizations provide them , though the number is rising .
`` Savior '' is the eleventh track from Rise Against 's 2008 fifth studio album Appeal to Reason . It was released as the album 's third single on June 3 , 2009 . The song is available as downloadable , additional content for the Rock Band series along with `` Prayer of the Refugee '' and `` Re-Education ( Through Labor ) '' . Also , in the trailer for the PC game The Sims 3 : Ambitions the song plays in the background in Simlish . It is a playable track in Guitar Hero : Warriors of Rock On September 8 , Rise Against finished shooting a video for `` Savior '' with director Kevin Kerslake , who directed `` Re-Education ( Through Labor ) '' , which also appears on Appeal to Reason . It was premiered on MTV2 on September 28 . The music video depicts the band playing in a construction site , while numerous people in animal costumes mosh . In between there are scenes of a polar bear riding a bus seeing what looks like animals in homeless situations , such as a lion going through a dumpster , a tiger lying on the steps of a morgue , a group of rabbits standing around a trashcan fire . At the bridge of the song the polar bear sees an elephant limping ; in a flashback scene , the elephant is shown violently pushing the polar bear out of the mosh pit , repeatedly . The polar bear then stops the bus , letting the elephant sit next to them . The two hold hands as the song ends . According to the director , the song is about forgiveness , and that the elephant represents the Republican Party , and the polar bear is representative of endangered species . Rise Against later released a slightly different version of the music video , that focused on the band 's performance aspects from the original video in which they play and destroy their instruments at the end of the song . The song peaked at number three on Billboards Alternative Songs chart , equalling the peak set by the same album 's first single , Re-Education ( Through Labor ) , and at number three on the Rock Songs chart , . It was the # 1 on the Rock Songs year-end chart while landing at # 2 on the Alternative Songs Best-of-2010 . It became the band 's second single to reach the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart , peaking at # 18 . It is also Rise Against 's highest charting single on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles , peaking at # 2 ( equivalent to # 102 on the Hot 100 ) . Savior is also notable for the extensive amount of time it has spent on the U.S. charts , spending 37 weeks on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart , the fourth-highest since the creation of the chart .
The British Rail Class 13 were created in 1965 because of a necessity to provide more powerful shunters for the Tinsley Marshalling Yard . This was achieved by permanently coupling together two Class 08 shunters as a ` master and slave ' ( alternatively ` cow and calf ' ) units , the latter with its cab removed . Both units were ballasted to improve traction . Initially the units were coupled cab-to-cab but it was found more practical to couple master nose to slave cab . The reason that a larger , rigid locomotive could not be used was due to the risk of grounding on the marshalling yard hump . With the end of hump shunting at Tinsley the class became obsolete . The unique qualities of the locomotives were not required elsewhere and so withdrawal was inevitable ; 13002 went in 1983 , with the remaining two locomotives going with the closure of Tinsley hump in 1985 . None of this unusual class survives .
Step pyramids are structures which characterized several cultures throughout history , in several locations throughout the world . These pyramids typically are large and made of several layers of stone . The term refers to pyramids of similar design that emerged separately from one another , as there are no firmly established connections between the different civilizations that built them . Ziggurats were huge religious monuments built in the ancient Mesopotamian valley and western Iranian plateau , having the form of a terraced step pyramid of successively receding stories or levels . There are 32 ziggurats known at , and near , Mesopotamia . Twenty-eight of them are in Iraq , and four of them are in Iran . Notable Ziggurats include the Great Ziggurat of Ur near Nasiriyah , Iraq , the Ziggurat of Aqar Quf near Baghdad , Iraq , Chogha Zanbil in KhÅ `` zestÄ n , Iran , the most recent to be discovered â `` Sialk near Kashan , Iran and others . Ziggurats were built by the Sumerians , Babylonians , Elamites and Assyrians as monuments to local religions . The probable predecessors of the ziggurat were temples supported on raised platforms or terraces that date from the Ubaid period during the fourth millennium BC , and the latest date from the 6th century BC . The earliest ziggurats probably date from the latter part of the Early Dynastic Period of Sumer . Built in receding tiers upon a rectangular , oval , or square platform , the ziggurat was a pyramidal structure . Sun-baked bricks made up the core of the ziggurat with facings of fired bricks on the outside . The facings were often glazed in different colors and may have had astrological significance . Kings sometimes had their names engraved on these glazed bricks . The number of tiers ranged from two to seven , with a shrine or temple at the summit . Access to the shrine was provided by a series of ramps on one side of the ziggurat or by a spiral ramp from base to summit . It was also called Hill of Heaven or Mountain of the gods . The earliest Egyptian pyramids were step pyramids . During the Third dynasty of Egypt , the architect Imhotep built Egypt 's first step pyramid , the Pyramid of Djoser , by building a series of six successively smaller mastabas ( an earlier form of tomb structure ) , one a top of another . Later pharaohs , including Sekhemkhet and Khaba , built similar structures . The first step pyramid was built for Djoser ( or Zoser ) . By the time of the Fourth dynasty of Egypt , plans had changed into the transformation of the `` true pyramid '' . The earliest smooth-sided pyramid , located at Meidum , started out as a step pyramid under Huni structure . Sneferu 's own later monuments , the Bent Pyramid and Red Pyramid at Dahshur , were the first true pyramids to be built as such from scratch , and it was with this innovation that the age of Egyptian stepped pyramids came to an end . A step pyramid exists in the archaeological site of Monte d'Accoddi , in Sardinia , dating to the 4th millennium BC . The most prolific builders of these step pyramids were the Pre-Columbian civilizations . The remains of step pyramids can be found throughout the Mayan cities of the YucatÃ n , as well as in Aztec and Toltec architecture . In many of these cases , successive layers of pyramids were built on top of the pre-existing structures , with which the pyramids expanded in size on a cyclical basis . This is true of the Great Pyramid of Cholula and of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan . Step pyramids were also a part of South American architecture , such as that of the Moche , the ChavÃ n culture and the Aztec civilization . There are a number of earthwork step pyramids within North America . Often associated with mounds and other mortuary complexes across the Eastern Woodlands ( concentrated in the North American Southeast ) , step pyramids were constructed as ceremonial centres by the Mississippian cultures ( 900-1500CE ) , and are regarded as a facet of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex . The largest earthen work step pyramid of this type in North America is Monk 's Mound , located in present-day Cahokia , Illinois . With the base of the structure exceeding 16 acres Monks Mound is also one of the largest pyramids by area in the world ( after La Danta and Great Pyramid of Cholula ) .

Life After Life is a 1975 book written by psychiatrist Raymond Moody . It is a report on a qualitative study in which Moody interviewed 150 people who had undergone near-death experiences ( NDEs ) . The book presents the author 's composite account of what it is like to die . On the basis of his collection of cases , Moody identified a common set of elements in NDEs : Life After Life sold more than 13 million copies , was translated into a dozen foreign languages and became an international best seller , which made the subject of NDEs popular and opened the way for many other studies . Moody wrote a second book , Reflections on Life After Life ( ISBN 0817714233 ) , in 1977 .

South Lanarkshire is one of 32 unitary council areas of Scotland , covering the southern part of the former county of Lanarkshire . It borders the south-east of the city of Glasgow and contains many of Glasgow 's suburbs , commuter towns and smaller villages . South Lanarkshire Council has its headquarters in Hamilton , has 16,000 employees , and a budget of almost Â # 1bn . The council plan for 2007-2012 when the next council elections are due is Connect . The large and varied council area takes in rural and upland areas , market towns such as Lanark , Strathaven and Carluke , the urban burghs of Rutherglen , Cambuslang , and East Kilbride which was Scotland 's first new town . There are 20 council wards in South Lanarkshire , each represented on the council by 3 or 4 elected councillors using Single Transferable Vote . South Lanarkshire operates a cabinet style system , with key decisions being taken by the Executive Committee , under the leadership of the Council Leader , and approved by the council , led by the Provost . South Lanarkshire shares borders with the unitary authorities of Dumfries and Galloway , East Ayrshire , East Renfrewshire , City of Glasgow , North Lanarkshire , West Lothian and Scottish Borders . The area was formed in 1996 , from the areas of Clydesdale , Hamilton and East Kilbride districts , and some outer areas of Glasgow District ( Rutherglen\/Fernhill , Cambuslang\/Halfway and part of King 's Park\/Toryglen ) . Since the elections , there has been one by-election and the current political composition is 3 Independent , 8 Conservative , 31 Labor , 2 Liberal Democrats and 23 SNP . The Council Headquarters building , on Almada Street , Hamilton , was built as the Lanark County Buildings in 1963 , and designed by Lanark council architect D G Bannerman . The 16 storey , 165 foot tower is the largest in Hamilton , and is a highly visible landmark across this part of the Clyde Valley . The modernist design was influenced by the United Nations building in New York . Glass curtain walls cover the north and south facades , with the narrow east and west sides being blank white walls .

Gordon and Derakh were also experienced producers , having produced Coal Chamber 's self-titled CD . Within six months Jonathan Davis , who performed with Shuck in Sexart , signed Orgy to Korn 's label Elementree Records . In 1998 , Orgy released their debut album , Candyass , the name inspired by a drag queen they had met , selling nearly two million copies . The album produced two singles ; a cover of the New Order song `` Blue Monday '' , and `` Stitches '' . The song `` Revival '' featured Jonathan Davis of Korn . Orgy made their live debut at EdgeFest , an annual radio show in Tulsa , Oklahoma in 1998 . They also appeared on the Family Values Tour with Korn , Limp Bizkit , Ice Cube , Incubus , and Rammstein . They were featured on the live compilation album of the tour , released in 1999 . Other tours with Love and Rockets and Sugar Ray followed . Their second album , the science fiction-themed Vapor Transmission , was released in 2000 , with `` Fiction ( Dreams in Digital ) '' and `` Opticon '' as singles . In 2001 , Orgy released the song `` Faces '' for the soundtrack of the film Zoolander . Orgy was a musical guest on WB 's Charmed , performing `` Opticon '' in the episode `` Sin Francisco '' . In late 2003 guitarists Shuck and Derakh formed a side project , Julien-K , as an outlet for electronic material they had come up with during the writing process for Orgy . They released their first album , titled Death to Analog , in March 2009 , and are producing Chester Bennington of Linkin Park 's side project , Dead by Sunrise . Jay Gordon also remixed the Linkin Park track `` Points of Authority '' , for their album Reanimation , where it was renamed `` Pts . Of . Athrty '' . After the release of Vapor Transmission , Orgy left Reprise Records and had already severed ties with Elementree . Gordon started his own independent record label , D1 Music , releasing the band 's third album , Punk Statik Paranoia in 2004 . When asked for an Orgy update in late July 2008 , Shuck informed fans that Orgy 's return is still underway but their priority is getting the much delayed Julien-K album released . During a video interview at the annual Californian NAMM 2009 convention , Derakh mentioned a 2010 Orgy reunion . On March 30 , 2010 , through a video to his Julien-K , Dead By Sunrise , and Orgy followers , Shuck informed that there are plans for a tour in 2010 . On October 25 , 2010 , Ryan Shuck and Amir Derakh informed that `` As of Oct. 26th Jay Gordon will be leaving the original band Orgy . '' On October 30 , 2010 , Jay Gordon released a statement via his official Facebook profile stating that he still owns the Orgy name and wants to continue forth creating new material for the band . Jay wrote that all previous members of the band were too busy with numerous side-projects to continue with the original band . `` Everyone has been so busy with their different projects I figured this was the only way for me to continue on with the name . I started this band , and I do n't want to let it fall to the wayside completely . '' .

Bleed American is the fourth studio album by American alternative rock band Jimmy Eat World . The album was released on July 18 , 2001 , and became self-titled ( Jimmy Eat World ) following the September 11 attacks , before reverting to its original name for a deluxe edition released in 2008 . The album was the third Jimmy Eat World album produced by former Drive Like Jehu drummer Mark Trombino . The album artwork is taken from William Eggleston 's photograph `` Memphis '' . It was highly acclaimed by critics . On April 28 , 2008 , a deluxe edition of the album was released with a bonus disc containing several b-sides , acoustic versions , live versions , demo versions and previously unreleased tracks . The original title Bleed American was restored . The album is certified Platinum by the RIAA , having sold more than 1 million copies in the U.S. . It is also certified Platinum by the CRIA and Silver by the BPI . All songs written by Jimmy Eat World , except portions of `` A Praise Chorus '' .
A tor is a rock outcrop formed by weathering , usually found on or near the summit of a hill . In the South West of England , where the term originated , it is also a word used for the hills themselves â `` particularly the high points of Dartmoor in Devon and Bodmin Moor in Cornwall . The word ` tor ' is also used in southern Wales , particularly on the rocky coastlines such as the Vale of Glamorgan and the Gower Peninsula ; on the Gower one of the sandy beaches near Oxwich Bay is called `` Tor Bay '' because the beach is framed by a huge outcrop of carboniferous limestone . Tor ( Cornish tor , Old Welsh twrr , Modern Welsh tÅ r , Scots Gaelic tÃ rr , meaning hill ) is notable for being one among a mere handful of Celtic loanwords to be borrowed into vernacular English before the modern era -- such borrowings are mainly words of a geographic or topographical nature , also including crag ( from the Welsh word craig , meaning `` rock '' ) and `` avon '' ( from the Welsh word afon , meaning `` river '' ) . Tors are composed usually of granite or metamorphic rocks . Tors can also be found around any previously erupted volcanoes ( although Devonian and Carboniferous outcrops are also found ) , though occasionally of other hard rocks such as quartzite , and are the result of millions of years of weathering . In prehistoric times , when the land was covered in forest , rain water seeped into the ground and gradually weathered the bedrock through its natural cracks , or joints . Once the land became exposed , the weathering was accelerated , particularly during the Ice age when freezing water expanded in the cracks . The result can be seen today in dramatic rock formations . Weathering has also given rise to circular `` rock basins ' '' formed by the accumulation of water and the repeated freezing and thawing â `` a fine example is to be found at Kes Tor on Dartmoor . As the weathering of the tors continues , the rock is broken down into ever smaller sizes . Many hillsides are covered with loose rocks , known as clitter , which have provided ready building materials for thousands of years . Eventually the granite is weathered down to a level equivalent to sandy gravel , known as growan , which consists of individual crystals . The most distinctive granite landform in temperate countries is the tor and in tropical regions , the inselbergs . Both suggest the removal of material by solifluction and hence lead to the opinion that tors and inselbergs are relict features . Dartmoor represents one of the largest areas of exposed granite in the United Kingdom , covering an area of 368 square miles ( 954 square kilometres ) . It is part of a chain of granite stretching through Cornwall , as far as the Isles of Scilly . Some of the more durable granite survived to form the rocky crowns of Dartmoor tors . One of the best known is at Haytor , on the eastern part of the moor , whose granite is of unusually fine quality and was quarried during the 19th and early 20th centuries . Its stone was used to construct the pillars outside the British Museum in London , and to build London Bridge ( now in Arizona ) . The last granite to be quarried there was used to build Exeter War Memorial in 1919 . Ten Tors is an annual weekend hike on Dartmoor . For a list of Dartmoor 's tors see List of Dartmoor tors and hills .
A shore or shoreline is the fringe of land at the edge of a large body of water , such as an ocean , sea , or lake . In Physical Oceanography a shore is the wider fringe that is geologically modified by the action of the body of water past and present , while the beach is at the edge of the shore , representing the intertidal zone where there is one . In contrast to a coast , a shore can border any body of water , while the coast must border an ocean ; that is , a coast is a type of shore . Shore is often substituted for coast where an oceanic shore is meant . Shores are influenced by the topography of the surrounding landscape , as well as by water induced erosion , such as waves . The geological composition of rock and soil dictates the type of shore which is created .
Cuneo is a province in the southwest of the Piedmont region of Italy . To the west it borders on the French region of Provence-Alpes-C Ã te d'Azur ( departments of Alpes-Maritimes , Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and Hautes-Alpes ) . To the north it borders on the province of Turin . To the east it borders on the province of Asti . To the south it borders on the Ligurian provinces of Savona and Imperia . It is also known as the Provincia Granda , the big province , because it is the third largest province in Italy ( following Bolzano and Foggia ) . This has created problems in the past with the Alba 's inhabitants , frustrated from the long trip to Cuneo every time they need to have business with the provincial government . The issue of dividing the province into two has been brought up several times . Its capital is the city of Cuneo . Of the 250 communes in the province , the largest by population are :

Frankfort is a city in Clinton County , Indiana , United States . The population was 16,422 at the 2010 census . The city is the county seat of Clinton County . Brothers John , William and Nicholas Pence , previously of Warren County , Ohio , settled on the land on which Frankfort now stands in 1829 , having entered it from the government in 1827 and 1828 . In 1830 , the brothers donated 60 a of the land to the county commissioners , a donation which led to the establishment of the county seat at that site rather than in Jefferson , a community which had also been vying for the honor . The new town was named Frankfort at the brothers ' request and honors their German great-grandparents ' home of Frankfurt am Main . The town of Frankfort was laid off on the 60 a tract by William Douglass , the county agent , and the plat filed on June 8 , 1830 . The original plat consisted of 64 lots in eight blocks surrounding a public square where the courthouse now stands . The county board paid contractors Allen & Michael the sum of $ 20 to erect the first courthouse , a one-and-a-half story temporary structure made a logs hewn from trees that grew on the square and surrounding streets . Its replacement was built by contractor John Elder in 1837-1838 for $ 12,000 and operated for 45 years . Indianapolis architect George W. Bunting in 1881 designed the third courthouse , a 165 f tall structure built of Indiana limestone by contractors Farman & Pearce for approximately $ 200,000 . Its cornerstone was laid September 2 , 1882 . Frankfort is located at ( 40.282182 , -86.511466 ) .

The British Rail Class 306 was a type of electric multiple unit ( EMU ) introduced in 1949 . It consisted of 92 three-car trains which were used on newly electrified suburban lines between and London Liverpool Street . Class 306 trains were built to a pre-World War II LNER design by Metro Cammell and Birmingham RCW , and were equipped with English Electric traction equipment . Each carriage featured two sets of twin sliding passenger doors , which could be opened by either the guard or the passengers using the passenger operated buttons fitted next to them , on both the outside and inside of the trains . When first built the trains were energised at 1,500 V direct current ( DC ) which was sourced from overhead wires , being collected by a cross-arm pantograph located above the cab on the Motor Brake Second Open ( MBSO ) vehicle . In the early 1960s the overhead wires were re-energised at 25,000 V alternating current ( AC ) ( and 6,250 V AC in the London area ) and the trains were rebuilt to operate using this very different electrical system . This entailed the fitting of a transformer and rectifier unit , which were located on the underframe between the bogies of the intermediate carriage . At the same time the location of the pantograph was moved to this carriage as well . Because this reduced the headroom inside the train , the guards ' compartment was relocated to be directly below the pantograph , which was replaced by the more modern Stone Faiveley AMBR pantograph design . The trains were then re-numbered 001-092 with the last two digits of each carriage number ( previously numbered in the LNER coaching series ) the same as the unit number . The Class 306 trains were withdrawn in the early 1980s , and one unit , 306017 , has been preserved . It has been repainted in a near original green livery , albeit with a yellow warning panel on the front to comply with present-day safety regulations . The 306 unit is in store at MoD Kineton at the moment awaiting the resolving of issues such as asbestos contamination before it can be transferred to the NRMâ s ownership and moved to York .

A motte-and-bailey is a form of castle , with a wooden or stone keep situated on a raised earthwork ( motte ) , accompanied by an enclosed courtyard ( bailey ) surrounded by a protective fence . Many were built in Britain , Ireland and France in the 11th and 12th centuries , favored as a relatively cheap but effective defensive fortification that could be built very quickly and repel most small attacks . A motte is a mound , often artificial , topped with a wooden or stone structure known as a keep . The earth for the mound would be taken from a ditch , dug around the motte or around the whole castle . The outer surface of the mound could be covered with clay or strengthened with wooden supports . There are two surviving examples of castles with two mottes , one being Lewes Castle and the other Lincoln Castle . Most were originally topped with wooden structures , which could be built with readily available materials and without highly skilled labor , although many such structures were later replaced with stone keeps . A bailey is an enclosed courtyard overlooked by the motte and typically surrounded by a wooden fence called a palisade . It was usually used as a living area by servants of the castle 's lord . Also located inside the bailey would be a blacksmith , a miller , and most of the craftsmen typically required during the medieval period . A castle could have more than one bailey , sometimes an inner and an outer , such as at Warkworth Castle , where expansion of the castle led to enclosure of a new bailey with a wall . Alternatively , the multiple baileys could flank the motte , such as at Windsor Castle . The bailey was often directly connected to the ditch surrounding the motte . The bailey was often enclosed inside another wooden palisade and surrounding ditch to add an extra layer of protection . It was connected to the motte by a timber drawbridge , which could be separated from the bailey as a last defense mechanism . There was in many cases another drawbridge at the entrance into the bailey that could similarly be raised for protection . The bailey would typically contain a hall , stables for the horses and cattle , a chapel , and huts for the nobleman 's people . There were often shops inside the bailey for local merchants .

The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station ( SONGS ) is a nuclear power plant located on the Pacific coast of California . The 84 a site is in the northwestern corner of San Diego County , south of San Clemente , and surrounded by the San Onofre State Park and next to the I-5 Highway . Unit 1 is no longer in service and has been dismantled . It is being used as a storage site for spent fuel . It had a spherical containment of concrete and steel with the smallest wall being 6 f thick . This reactor was a first generation Westinghouse pressurized water reactor that operated for 25 years , closing permanently in 1992 . Units 2 and 3 , Combustion Engineering pressurized water reactors , continue to operate and generate 1,172 MWe and 1,178 MWe respectively . The July 12 , 1982 edition of Time ( magazine ) states , `` The firm Bechtel was further embarrassed in 1977 , when it installed a 420-ton nuclear-reactor vessel backwards '' at San Onofre . The plant is operated by Southern California Edison . Edison International , parent of SCE , holds 78.2 % ownership in the plant ; San Diego Gas & Electric Company , 20 % ; and the City of Riverside Utilities Department , 1.8 % . The plant employs over 2000 people . The plant is located in Nuclear Regulatory Commission Region IV . Strong , spherical containment buildings around the reactors are designed to prevent unexpected releases of radiation . The closest tectonic fault line is the Cristianitos fault , which is considered inactive . Southern California Edison states the station was `` built to withstand a 7.0 magnitude earthquake directly under the plant '' . Unlike many pressurized water reactors , but like some other seaside facilities in Southern California , the San Onofre plant uses seawater for cooling , and thus lacks the iconic large cooling towers typically associated with nuclear generating stations . However , changes to water-use regulations may require construction of such cooling towers in the future to avoid further direct use of seawater . Limited available land next to the reactor would likely require the towers to be built on the opposite side of the Interstate 5 highway . In the James W. Huston book , Fallout , Pakistani Air Force Pilots attempt to bomb San Onofre using stolen California Air National Guard F-16s . The generating station was also featured in the 1983 film Koyaanisqatsi . In the James Bond book License Renewed by John Gardner , it was one of six nuclear power stations in the terrorist\/blackmail plot `` Meltdown '' planned by The Laird of Murcaldy , Anton Murik . The original San Onofre Unit-1 Power Plant was used as the `` Gotham City '' Atomic Reactor in the 1960s Batman TV show starring Adam West . In the science fiction novel Timescape , by Gregory Benford , the nuclear plants at San Onofre raised the water temperature along the adjacent coast , which stimulated aquatic life . The plant 's two large containment structures are briefly shown in the 1988 movie The Naked Gun when detective Frank Drebin ( Leslie Nielsen ) talks about how everything reminds him of his ex-girlfriend ( quote : â Everywhere I look something reminds me of herâ ) . In the 2011 TV series The Event , the fuel rods were removed and transported from San Onofre Nuclear Generation Station to thwart the aliens ' plan to steal the uranium to build their specialized transport array . The transport array was utilized to transport the citizens from their own planet to Earth .
Angel Road railway station is in the London Borough of Enfield at Edmonton in north east London , and is in Travelcard Zone 4 , on the Tottenham Hale branch of the Lea Valley Lines . The station , and all trains serving it , is operated by National Express East Anglia . It is partially located beneath the A406 road ( which is named Angel Road at that point ) . Due to reconstruction of the A406 in the mid-1990s ( involving grade-separation ) , the station no longer has an entrance on Angel Road , with the only access via a footpath running south from Conduit Lane to the north . The station is unstaffed . Prior to December 2005 the typical off-peak service from the station was one train per hour to Bishop 's Stortford and one train per hour to London Liverpool Street . As a result of timetable changes Angel Road now only gets one train a day to and from Liverpool Street , with the remainder of the service operating to and from Stratford . There is no service on weekdays before 05:55 , between 10:00 and 15:45 , or after 20:00 , and no service at weekends or public holidays . Opened as Water Lane on 1 March 1849 by the Eastern Counties Railway , then by the Great Eastern Railway , renamed Angel Road on 1 January 1864 it became part of the London and North Eastern Railway during the Grouping of 1923 . The station then passed on to the Eastern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948 . When Sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s , the station was served by Network SouthEast until the Privatisation of British Railways .
Nupedia was an English-language Web-based encyclopedia whose articles were written by experts and licensed as free content . It was founded by Jimmy Wales and underwritten by Bomis , with Larry Sanger as editor-in-chief . Nupedia lasted from March 2000 until September 2003 , and is mostly known now as the predecessor of the free wiki encyclopedia , Wikipedia . Unlike Wikipedia , Nupedia was not a wiki ; it was instead characterized by an extensive peer-review process , designed to make its articles of a quality comparable to that of professional encyclopedias . Nupedia wanted scholars to volunteer content for free . Before it ceased operating , Nupedia produced 24 articles that completed its review process ( three articles also existed in two versions of different lengths ) , and 74 more articles were in progress . In June 2008 , CNET hailed Nupedia as one of the greatest defunct websites in the still young internet history . In late 1999 , Wales began thinking about an online encyclopedia built by volunteers and , in January 2000 , hired Sanger to oversee its development . The project officially went online on March 9 , 2000 . By November 2000 , however , only two full-length articles had been published . From its beginning , Nupedia was a free content encyclopedia , with Bomis intending to generate revenue from online ads on Nupedia.com . Initially the project used a homegrown license , the Nupedia Open Content License . In January 2001 , it switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urgings of Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation . However , Stallman got behind Hector Facundo Arena 's GNUPedia project at the same time , which led to concerns about possible competition between the projects . Also in January 2001 , Nupedia started Wikipedia as a side-project to allow collaboration on articles prior to entering the peer review process . This attracted interest from both sides , as it provided the less bureaucratic structure favored by GNUPedia advocates . As a result , GNUPedia never really developed and the threat of competition between the projects was averted . As Wikipedia grew and attracted contributors , it quickly developed a life of its own and began to function largely independently of Nupedia , although Sanger initially led activity on Wikipedia by virtue of his position as Nupedia 's editor-in-chief . Besides leading to discontinuation of the GNUPedia project , Wikipedia also led to the gradual demise of Nupedia . Due to the collapse of the internet economy at that time , Jimmy Wales decided to discontinue funding for a salaried editor-in-chief in December 2001 and Sanger resigned from both projects soon thereafter . After Sanger 's departure , Nupedia increasingly became an afterthought to Wikipedia ; of the Nupedia articles that completed the review process , only two did so after 2001 . As Nupedia dwindled into inactivity , the idea of converting it into a stable version of approved Wikipedia articles was occasionally broached , but never implemented . The Nupedia website at nupedia.com was shut down on September 26 , 2003 , but a few pages were still available at a mirror . Nupedia 's ( limited ) content has since been assimilated into Wikipedia . Authors were expected to be experts in their fields ( although the definition of expert allowed for a degree of flexibility , and it was acknowledged that some articles could be written by a good writer , rather than an expert per se ) and editors were expected to be `` true experts in their fields and ( with few exceptions ) possess PhDs '' . Nupedia was powered by NupeCode collaborative software . NupeCode is free\/open source software ( released under the GNU General Public License ) designed for large peer review projects . The code was available via Nupedia 's CVS repository . One of the problems experienced by Nupedia during much of its existence was that the software lacked functionality . Much of the missing functionality had been mocked-up using underlined blocks of text which appeared to be hyperlinks , but actually were not . As part of the project , a new version of the original software ( called `` NuNupedia '' ) was under development . NuNupedia was implemented for testing at SourceForge , but never reached a sufficient stage of development to replace the original software .
The British Rail Class 460 ( or 8Gat ) electrical multiple units were built by Alstom at Washwood Heath from 2000-01 . These units are part of Alstom 's `` Juniper '' family of units , which also includes Classes 334 and 458 . The eight Class 460 units are , as of August 2009 , the latest to be classified under the TOPS `` 4XX '' series for DC 3rd Rail EMUs on the Southern Region . When the National Express Group won the Gatwick Express franchise , part of the agreement was to replace the ageing Class 73\/2 locomotives , British Rail Class 488 coaching stock , and Class 489 motor luggage vans . Therefore , an order was placed with Alstom for the construction of eight 8-car Class 460 units . Deliveries of the new units commenced in 2000 . The units featured controversial sloping cab-ends , which quickly earned them the nickname `` Darth Vaders '' amongst rail enthusiasts . A Juniper Coupler is located under the removable nose cone . Each eight carriage unit is formed of a driving motor luggage van , two intermediate 1st-class\/composite trailers , two intermediate 2nd-class motor carriages , an intermediate 2nd-class trailer , another 2nd-class motor carriage , and a 2nd-class driving motor ( DMLFO+TFO+TCO+MSO+MSO+TSO+MSO+DMSO ) . The units are numbered 460001-008 , although only the last two digits are carried on the cab ends . The full six digit unit number is carried on the side of the luggage vans . On 22 June 2008 , the fleet was transferred to Southern , as the Gatwick Express service was incorporated into the Southern franchise . The 460s are allocated to Stewarts Lane TMD in South London . From December 2010 , the 460s are gradually being phased out from Gatwick Express service . The formations of the 8Gat unit is shown below . Under normal circumstances , the luggage van ( DMLFO ) is at the ` London ' end of the train ( i.e. closest to the station concourse at London Victoria ) . Under the government 's Rolling Stock Plan , South West Trains are due to receive up to 140 additional vehicles . Porterbrook , the owner of the Class 458 fleet , has proposed that part of this could be met through lengthening the 4-car Junipers to 5-cars using the mechanically similar Class 460s . 24 Class 458s would be lengthened using vehicles from the Class 460s , while the remaining Class 460 vehicles would be reformed into six new 5-car sets , leaving additional vehicles for use as spare parts . Under the `` Sussex Route Utilisation Strategy '' document published on 28 January 2010 , Network Rail stated that the class 460 fleet would be removed from Gatwick Express operations by Dec 2010 to strengthen operations elsewhere , possibly augmenting the similar Class 458 units working for South West Trains on routes out of London Waterloo .
Serial Storage Architecture ( SSA ) is a serial transport protocol used to attach disk drives to servers . It was invented by Ian Judd of IBM in 1990 . IBM produced a number of successful products based upon this standard before it was overtaken by the more widely adopted Fibre Channel protocol . SSA was promoted as an open standard by the SSA Industry Association . A number of vendors including IBM , Pathlight Technology and Viacom produced products based on SSA . It was also adopted as an ANSI X3T10 .1 standard . SSA devices are logically SCSI devices and conform to all of the SCSI command protocols . SSA provides data protection for critical applications by helping to ensure that a single cable failure will not prevent access to data . All the components in a typical SSA subsystem are connected by bi-directional cabling . Data sent from the adaptor can travel in either direction around the loop to its destination . SSA detects interruptions in the loop and automatically reconfigures the system to help maintain connection while a link is restored . Up to 192 hot swappable hard disk drives can be supported per system . Drives can be designated for use by an array in the event of hardware failure . Up to 32 separate RAID arrays can be supported per adaptor , and arrays can be mirrored across servers to provide cost-effective protection for critical applications . Furthermore , arrays can be sited up to 25 metres apart - connected by thin , low-cost copper cables - allowing subsystems to be located in secure , convenient locations , far from the server itself . With its inherent resiliency and ease of use , SSA is deployed in server\/RAID environments , where it is capable of providing for up to 80 Mbyte\/s of data throughput , with sustained data rates as high as 60 Mbytes\/s in non-RAID mode and 35 Mbytes\/s in RAID mode . The copper cables used in SSA configurations are round bundles of two or four twisted pairs , up to 25 metres long and terminated with 9-pin micro-D connectors . Impedances are 75 ohm single-ended , and 150 ohm differential . For longer-distance connections , it is possible to use fiber-optic cables up to 10 km ( 6 mi ) in length . Signals are differential TTL . The transmission capacity is 20 megabytes per second in each direction per channel , with up to two channels per cable . The transport layer protocol is non return to zero , with 8B\/10B encoding ( 10 bits per character ) . Higher protocol layers were based on the SCSI-3 standard .

Sandro Salvadore ( 29 November 1939 -- 4 January 2007 ) was an Italian footballer . Born Milan , Lombardy , Sandro Salvadore was picked up by A.C. Milanâ s scouts when he was 15 , and played in their junior team until he made his debut in Serie A in the 1958\/59 season aged 20 . While wearing AC Milanâ s number 6 shirt he won 2 League titles ( 1958 -- 59 and 1961 -- 62 ) . He left Milan after 72 league matches . In 1962 Salvadore was purchased by Juventus and became soon a pillar of their defense . After only a few games he fully established himself as a first choice Libero , winning three more League titles ( 1966 -- 67 , 1971 -- 72 and 1972 -- 73 ) and one Italyâ s Cup ( 1964 -- 65 ) . Salvadore was also the captain of Juventus when they finished as runners-up in the 1972 â `` 73 European Cup final and the 1973 Intercontinental Cup final .

At the time , it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Caesar and Paullus ( or , less frequently , year 754 Ab urbe condita ) . The denomination 1 for this year has been used since the early medieval period , when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years . It was the first year of the Christian\/Common era . The preceding year is 1 BC in the widely used Julian calendar , which does not have a `` year zero '' .

The ( pronounced and the Bavarian form of the female noun ' , i. e. `` mass '' , though commonly misinterpreted as the neuter noun ( with a long vowel ) ' , translating to `` measure '' ) is a term used in German-speaking countries for a unit of volume , now typically used for measuring beer . In modern times , a is defined as exactly 1 litre . is often used as an abbreviation for ( plural : ) , a one litre volume glass drinking vessel with a handle . This is frequently used in Bavarian beer gardens and beer halls and is a staple of Oktoberfest . It is often referred to as a beer stein or beer mug by English speakers . In the Southern German areas ( Austro-Bavarian ) , the originally measured 1.069 litres , equivalent to 2.259 US or 1.881 UK pints . Other German speaking areas had different measures . In Baden until 1871 , and Switzerland from 1838 through 1877 the was 1.5 litres . A can be made of stoneware or of glass . A stoneware mug can be referred to as a '' '' , '' '' , or '' '' . A glass mug is referred to as a '' . '' The is the mug most often used in beer gardens or at home . Many are designed for decorative use only . Old or collectible with lead-based firing glaze should not be used for drinking . These types of drinkware are among the most common souvenirs brought back from German speaking countries . Some beer gardens and restaurants have spaces they rent out to patrons where they can store their . For a small monthly rent the establishment will wash your mug and keep it safe for you until you return . Sometimes the rent goes up with the prominence of the storage location . are frequently decorated with a print of the sign of the brewery . On the upper end , a calibration mark is found to which the beer must be filled when served ( but Bavarian hospitality dictates that the mark should be exceeded ) . If a belongs to a person then often a lid made of tin is attached . These lids bear engravings , usually the initials of the person it belongs to and some engraving that gives a hint to the owners profession , wit or affections .

A ministry is a specialised organization responsible for a sector of government public administration , sometimes led by a minister , but usually a senior public servant , that can have responsibility for one or more departments , agencies , bureaus , commissions or other smaller executive , advisory , managerial or administrative organizations . Ministries are usually subordinate to the cabinet , and prime minister , president or chancellor . A government will usually have numerous ministries , each with a specialised field of providing public service . National ministries vary greatly between countries , but some common ones include Ministry of Defense , Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ministry of Finance , and Ministry of Health . In the United Kingdom , all government organizations that consist of civil servants , and which may or may not be headed by a government minister or secretary of state , are considered as departments . The term `` ministry '' has been retained for the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Justice . In Canada , four of the ten provincial governments use the term `` ministry '' to describe their departments ( namely Ontario , Saskatchewan , British Columbia , and Alberta ) but the other six , along with the federal government , use the term `` department '' . Despite the difference in nomenclature , both the provincial and federal governments use the term `` minister '' to describe the head of a ministry or department . The specific tasks assigned to a minister is referred to as his or her `` portfolio '' . New Zealand 's state agencies include a large number of ministries and a somewhat smaller number of departments . Increasingly , state sector agencies are styled neither as ministries nor as departments . All New Zealand agencies are under the direction of one or more ministers or associate ministers , whether they are styled `` ministries '' or not , though each body also has an apolitical chief executive . In ministries and departments , these chief executives are often called Secretaries . Some countries such as Sweden , Norway , Switzerland , the Philippines and the United States do not use the term `` ministry '' for their sectors of government public administration , and instead call them `` departments '' . In Hong Kong , the term `` bureau '' is used , and departments are subordinate to bureaux , while in Mexico , ministries are referred to as secretariats . The government departments of the Soviet Union before 1946 were named `` People 's Commissariats '' . In the European Union , departments are termed Directorate ( s ) - General with the civil servant in charge called a Director-General ( in the European Commission , the political head of the department is one of the European Commissioners ) . The term `` ministry '' has also been widely used in satire and parody to describe fictional departments .

Red Hat Linux , assembled by the company Red Hat , was a popular Linux based operating system until its discontinuation in 2004 . Red Hat Linux 1.0 was released on November 3 , 1994 . It was originally called `` Red Hat Commercial Linux '' It was the first Linux distribution to use the RPM Package Manager as its packaging format , and over time has served as the starting point for several other distributions , such as Mandriva Linux and Yellow Dog Linux . Since 2003 , Red Hat has discontinued the Red Hat Linux line in favor of Red Hat Enterprise Linux ( RHEL ) for enterprise environments . Fedora , developed by the community-supported Fedora Project and sponsored by Red Hat , is the free version best suited for home use . Red Hat Linux 9 , the final release , hit its official end-of-life on 2004-04-30 , although updates were published for it through 2006 by the Fedora Legacy project until that shut down in early 2007 . Version 3.0.3 was one of the first Linux distributions to support Executable and Linkable Format instead of the older a. out format . Red Hat Linux introduced a graphical installer called Anaconda , intended to be easy to use for novices , and which has since been adopted by some other Linux distributions . It also introduced a built-in tool called Lokkit for configuring the firewall capabilities . In version 6 Red Hat moved to glibc 2.1 , egcs-1 .2 , and to the 2.2 kernel . It also introduced Kudzu , a software library for automatic discovery and configuration of hardware . Version 7 was released in preparation for the 2.4 kernel , although the first release still used the stable 2.2 kernel . Glibc was updated to version 2.1.92 , which was a beta of the upcoming version 2.2 and Red Hat used a patched version of GCC from CVS that they called `` 2.96 '' . The decision to ship an unstable GCC version was due to GCC 2.95 's bad performance on non-i386 platforms , especially DEC Alpha . Newer GCCs had also improved support for the C + + standard , which caused much of the existing code not to compile . In particular , the use of a non-released version of GCC caused some criticism , e.g. from Linus Torvalds ' and The GCC Steering Committee ; Red Hat was forced to defend their decision . GCC 2.96 failed to compile the Linux kernel , and some other software used in Red Hat , due to stricter checks . It also had an incompatible C + + ABI with other compilers . The distribution included a previous version of GCC for compiling the kernel , called `` kgcc '' . As of Red Hat Linux 8.0 , UTF-8 was enabled as the default character encoding for the system . This had little effect on English-speaking users , but enabled much easier internationalisation and seamless support for multiple languages , including ideographic , bi-directional and complex script languages along with European languages . However , this did cause some negative reactions among existing Western European users , whose legacy ISO-8859-based setups were broken by the change . Version 8.0 was also the second to include the Bluecurve desktop theme . It used a common theme for GNOME-2 and KDE 3.0.2 desktops , as well as OpenOffice-1 .0 . KDE members did not appreciate the change , claiming that it was not in the best interests of KDE . Version 9 supported the Native POSIX Thread Library , which was ported to the 2.4 series kernels by Red Hat . Red Hat Linux lacked many features due to possible copyright and patent problems . For example , MP3 support was disabled in both Rhythmbox and XMMS ; instead , Red Hat recommended using Ogg Vorbis , which has no patents . MP3 support , however , could be installed afterwards , although royalties are required everywhere MP3 is patented . Support for Microsoft 's NTFS file system was also missing , but could be freely installed as well . Red Hat Linux was originally developed exclusively inside Red Hat , with the only feedback from users coming through bug reports and contributions to the included software packages â `` not contributions to the distribution as such . This was changed in late 2003 when Red Hat Linux merged with the community-based Fedora Project . The new plan is to draw most of the codebase from Fedora when creating new Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions . Fedora replaces the original Red Hat Linux download and retail version . The model is similar to the relationship between Netscape Communicator and Mozilla , or StarOffice and OpenOffice.org , although in this case the resulting commercial product is also fully free software . The official name of the Red Hat Linux distribution is Red Hat Linux ( often abbreviated to RHL ) . The first part , Red Hat , is that of the Red Hat software company . The second word Linux refers to the underlying Linux kernel written by Linus Torvalds and associated open source software . Release dates drawn from announcements on comp . os . linux . announce . Version names are chosen as to be cognitively related to the prior release , yet not related in the same way as the release before that . The Fedora and Red Hat Projects were merged on September 22 , 2003 .
Michael Errol Thwaite ( born 2 May 1983 ) is an Australian football ( soccer ) player from Cairns who plays for Gold Coast United . His career began at Sydney University in the New South Wales Winter Super League . He then spent two seasons playing for Marconi Stallions ( 2002-2004 ) in the now defunct NSL , before heading to Romania . He was then signed to WisÅ a KrakÃ w on a Bosman transfer from FC NaÅ # ional BucureÅ ti in Romania 's Divizia A. On 28 January 2008 he signed for SK Brann and was loaned to the Melbourne Victory on 19 June 2008 . On 26 July 2008 he scored his first goal for the Victory in a pre-season cup game against Perth Glory , to guide the Victory to a 1-0 win in Perth . On 5 January 2009 he was signed from Melbourne by Gold Coast United after successfully negotiating his transfer from Brann . Thwaite was part of the Australian under-20s team in the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship in the U.A.E. . He was also involved with the 2004 Olympics qualifying team , but did not make the final squad for the tournament proper . He made his international debut on 9 October 2005 in a 5-0 win in a friendly match held in London against Jamaica . He was a squad member of the Australian national team in their historic World Cup qualifying tie against Uruguay , but did not play , as head coach Guus Hiddink preferred the more experienced Tony PopoviÄ and Tony Vidmar in the starting lineup .

Yorkshire pudding , also known as ` pockets ' , is a dish that originated in Yorkshire , England . It is made from batter and usually served with roast beef and gravy . When wheat flour began to come into common use for making cakes and puddings , cooks in the north of England devised a means of making use of the fat that dropped into the dripping pan to cook a batter pudding while the meat roasted . In 1737 a recipe for ' A dripping pudding ' was published in `` The Whole Duty of a Woman '' : Make a good batter as for pancakes ; put in a hot toss-pan over the fire with a bit of butter to fry the bottom a little then put the pan and butter under a shoulder of mutton , instead of a dripping pan , keeping frequently shaking it by the handle and it will be light and savoury , and fit to take up when your mutton is enough ; then turn it in a dish and serve it hot . Similar instructions were published in 1747 in â The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Simpleâ by Hannah Glasse under the title of ` Yorkshire pudding ' . It was she who re-invented and re-named the original version , called Dripping Pudding , which had been cooked in England for centuries , although these puddings were much flatter than the puffy versions known today . A 2008 ruling by the Royal Society of Chemistry has it that `` A Yorkshire pudding is n't a Yorkshire pudding if it is less than four inches tall '' . The Yorkshire pudding is a staple of the British Sunday lunch and in some cases is eaten as a separate course prior to the main meat dish . This was the traditional method of eating the pudding and is still common in parts of Yorkshire today . Because the rich gravy from the roast meat drippings was used up with the first course , the main meat and vegetable course was often served with a parsley or white sauce . It is often claimed that the purpose of the dish was to provide a cheap way to fill the diners - the Yorkshire pudding being much cheaper than the other constituents of the meal - thus stretching a lesser amount of the more expensive ingredients as the Yorkshire pudding was traditionally served first . There are other uses for the traditional Yorkshire pudding and in various parts of the country but particularly in the North of England , the yorkshire pudding is served as a snack with jam or as a ` pudding ' in the true sense , sometimes with jam and icecream . Yorkshire pudding is cooked by pouring a thin batter made from flour , eggs , and milk into a preheated and oiled baking pan .
The Province of Teramo is located in the Abruzzo region of Italy . Its capital is the city of Teramo . The province has an area of 1,948 kmÂ , a population of 296,063 ( 2005 ) , and is subdivided into 47 comunes , see Comunes of the Province of Teramo . The Province of Teramo shares its northern border with the Province of Ascoli Piceno in the Marche Region , southern and southwestern borders with the Province of L'Aquila in the Abruzzo Region , and a western border with the Province of Rieti in the Region of Lazio . To the south is the Abruzzo Province of Pescara and to the east is the Adriatic Sea . The landscape of the Province of Teramo is somewhat peculiar in that it is dominated almost entirely on the east by a large body of water and on the west by the Apennine Mountains . The province is divided latitudinally by the hills and valleys that begin in the Apennines and run almost to the coast . In addition to the provincial capital , the most populous and important commercial centers include Roseto degli Abruzzi and Giulianova with populations of 24,000 and 22,000 inhabitants respectively . The peaks of the Gran Sasso rise to the west of the Province of Teramo while those of the Monti della Laga dominate its northern border . These two ridges are among the most distinctive and perhaps the most important of the entire Apennine Mountain range . The majestic Gran Sasso rises at its peak , the Corno Grande , to an altitude of 2912 meters and is characterized by steep , and in places virtually inaccessible , gorges . Calderone , the southernmost glacier in Continental European , is found nearby . In contrast to the rugged and isolated Gran Sasso area , the Monti della Laga are characterised by thick forests , shallow gorges , rolling slopes and valleys , and several spectacular waterfalls . On the eastern portion of the province are the so called `` seven sister '' beaches directly adjacent to the Adriatic Sea . These resorts are noted for very fine white sand and their mild and wholesome Mediterranean climates which support a rich flora of palm , pine and oleander trees . Much of the province is hilly and very few large flat plains are to be found . Running from the west to the east are a number of valley streams and rivers which eventually empty into the Adriatic Sea . The Voman is one important river traversing the province and at its source is the large lake , the Lago di Campotosto . The Province of Teramo holds a great many art treasures including several very early Christian-era temples . Dotted among the countryside are hilltop towns which once served as watchpoints and guardians of the deep and rocky valleys below . Connecting these treasures are important roads and trails that cut from the east to the west . Many of these follow shepherding routes that once dominated the area . Two important towns in the Province of Teramo are Civitella del Tronto and Atri . The first stood as the northernmost protective point of the Bourbon Empire . It was the last fortress to fall into the hands of the conquering French forces of Savoy . Still today , this fortress and the thriving town at its base testify to the power that the Bourbon Empire of Napes once possessed . In Atri there is an extraordinary Roman Catholic cathedral and an imposing theater . The town 's grandeur speaks of the importance of the once powerful Counts of Acquaviva who laid claim to this region . The provincial capital of Teramo hosts a majestic cathedral and has for centuries served all of Abruzzo as a main administrative and economic center . An historical event took place in the Province of Teramo on 15 September 2005 . On that day the President of Italy , Azeglio Ciampi , came to the city of Teramo to make a special presentation in honor of the resistance movement that arose in this town against the Nazi forces during the Second World War . A special note was made of the young Italian partisans who gathered in the village of Bosco Martese . There they risked deportation , severe reprisals , and other barbarous acts . Several of them , most famously Mario Capuani , gave their lives during these struggles . The Province of Teramo can be reached from the north and the south by the main highway , the A14 , that runs along the Adriatic Coast . It can be reached from the west by the A24 coming from Rome via L'Aquila . The central railroad station of the province is located in Giulianova . From here is it possible to follow the coastline to the north and south or to travel in a westerly direction towards the provincial capital . The port of Giulianova is the maritime terminal of the Province of Teramo . Since 2009 , the president of the province has been Valter Catarra of the centre-right political party . Teramo ( 52,794 ) , Roseto degli Abruzzi ( 23,669 ) , Giulianova ( 21,875 ) , Silvi Marina ( 15,247 ) , Martinsicuro ( 15,047 ) , Pineto ( 13,763 ) , Atri ( 11,269 ) , Alba Adriatica ( 11,219 ) , Sant ` Egidio alla Vibrata ( 9,177 ) , Mosciano Sant ` Angelo ( 8,559 ) , Tortoreto ( 8,536 ) , Montorio al Vomano ( 8,072 ) , Campli ( 7,598 ) , Bellante ( 7,208 ) .
The 1998 Winter Olympics , officially the XVIII Olympic Winter Games , was a winter multi-sport event celebrated from 7 to 22 February 1998 in Nagano , Japan . Seventy-two nations and 2,176 participans contested in seven sports and 72 events at 15 venues . The games saw the introduction of Women 's ice hockey , curling and snowboarding . National Hockey League players were allowed to participate in the Men 's ice hockey . The host was selected in 1992 preference to Salt Lake City , Ã -- stersund , Jaca and Aosta . They were the third Olympic Games and second winter Olympics to be held in Japan , after the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo . The games were succeeded by the 1998 Winter Paralympics from 5 to 14 March . BjÃ rn DÃ hlie won three gold medals in cross-country skiing , making him the most-winning Winter Olympic competior ever . Alpine skier Hermann Maier survived a fall in the downhill and went on to gold in the super-G and giant slalom . Netherlands won five of the ten speed skating events , including two each by Gianni Romme and Marianne Timmer . Canada beat Denmark in the women 's curling final , securing the latter their first Winter Olympic medal ever . Other candidate cities for the 1998 Olympics were Aosta , Italy ; Jaca , Spain ; Ã -- stersund , Sweden ; and Salt Lake City , United States . The host city selection was held in Birmingham , United Kingdom , on June 15 , 1991 , at the 97th IOC session . Nagano prevailed over Salt Lake City by just 4 votes . Nagano officials said the outcome was decided by the `` Atlanta factor '' , in which they claim the reason they won the vote over Salt Lake City was because the 1996 Summer Olympics were already scheduled to be in the United States in Atlanta just two years prior to these games . ( Host nation is highlighted . ) 72 nations participated in the 1998 Winter Olympic Games . The nations Azerbaijan , Kenya , Macedonia , Uruguay , and Venezuela participated in their first Winter Olympic Games .
Native Esperanto speakers ( in Esperanto denaskuloj ) are born into families in which Esperanto is spoken ( usually along with other languages ) . This usually occurs when the parents meet each other at an Esperanto gathering but do not know each otherâ s native language . Often one or both parents choose to use Esperanto as the main language in communicating with the children , who thus acquire the language in the way that other children acquire their native languages ; those children then become natively multilingual . It also happens that the parents use Esperanto between themselves , but use another language when speaking with the children . Then the children , who wish to understand what the parents are saying between themselves , learn ( or at least comprehend ) spoken Esperanto . Esperanto is not the primary language of any geographic region , outside of temporary gatherings ( such as conventions like the World Congress of Esperanto ) and isolated offices ( such as the World Esperanto Association 's central office in Rotterdam ) . Consequently , native speakers have limited opportunity to meet one another except where meetings are specially arranged . For this reason , some parents consider it important to regularly bring their children to Esperanto conventions . Similarly , the annual Children 's Congress of Esperanto ( Infana Kongreseto ) happens alongside the largest Esperanto convention , the World Congress of Esperanto ( Universala Kongreso ) . According to Ethnologue , there are `` 200 -- 2000 who speak Esperanto as a first language . '' The most famous native speaker of Esperanto is businessman George Soros , son of Tivadar Soros , publisher and writer in Esperanto . Also notable are young Holocaust victim Petr Ginz , whose drawing of the planet Earth as viewed from the moon was carried aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia , and Daniel Bovet , the recipient of the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . This is not a complete list of native Esperanto speakers , but only of those who are notable enough to have a Wikipedia article .
Pe ( Ð Ð ; italics : Ð Ð ) is a letter of the Cyrillic alphabet . It commonly represents the voiceless bilabial plosive \/ p \/ , like the pronunciation of â pâ in `` pack '' . The Cyrillic letter Pe was derived from the from the Greek letter Pi ( Î Ï ) . The name of Pe in the Early Cyrillic alphabet was ( pokoi ) , meaning `` peaceful state '' . In the Cyrillic numeral system , Pe had a value of 80 . The capital Cyrillic letter Pe looks looks exactly like the Greek capital Pi , and small Pe looks like a smaller version of the same . The Cyrillic letter Pe is not to be confused with the Cyrillic letter El ( Ð Ð '' ; italics : Ð Ð '' ) , which has a hook on the left leg . Small cursive\/italics Cyrillic Pe â Ð â in the majority of fonts or hand-written looks like the small italic Latin N â nâ . The pronunciations shown in the table are the primary ones for each language ; for details consult the articles on the languages .
The Thunder Bay Thunder Cats was the name of the Rockford IceHogs of the UHL ( now the International Hockey League ) prior to moving to Rockford . The team went through a number of different names prior to being the Thunder Cats , including the Thunder Bay Thunder Hawks and the Thunder Bay Senators . After the success of the 5-time Allan Cup champion Thunder Bay Twins , the Colonial Hockey League took interest in expanding to the Northwestern Ontario city . In 1991 , the Colonial league introduced the Thunder Bay Thunder Hawks , spelling the end of the 21-year Twins franchise that stepped aside for the new Semi-Pro team . In 1993 , the team changed its name to the Thunder Bay Senators to reflect the teams affiliation with the National Hockey League 's Ottawa Senators . Soon after , the CoHL changed its name to the United Hockey League and in 1996 the team became the Thunder Bay Thunder Cats . After eight seasons in Thunder Bay , the Thunder Cats were bought , moved to Rockford , Illinois , and renamed the Rockford IceHogs in 1999 .
A postscript , abbreviated P.S. , is writing added after the main body of a letter ( or other body of writing ) . The term comes from the Latin post scriptum , an expression meaning `` written after '' ( which may be interpreted in the sense of `` that which comes after the writing '' ) . A postscript may be a sentence , a paragraph , or occasionally many paragraphs added , often hastily and incidentally , after the signature of a letter or ( sometimes ) the main body of an essay or book . In a book or essay , a more carefully composed addition ( e.g. , for a second edition ) is called an afterword . An afterword , not usually called a postscript , is written in response to critical remarks on the first edition . The word `` postscript '' has , poetically , been used to refer to any sort of addendum to some main work , even if not attached to a main work , as in SÃ ren Kierkegaard 's book titled Concluding Unscientific Postscript . Sometimes , when additional points are made after the first postscript , abbreviations such as PPS ( post-post-scriptum , or postquam-post-scriptum ) and PPPS ( post-post-post-scriptum , and so on , ad infinitum ) are used , though only PPS has somewhat common usage . A postscript may be used to add additional information about the book .

In computing , a Las Vegas algorithm is a randomized algorithm that always gives correct results ; that is , it always produces the correct result or it informs about the failure . In other words , a Las Vegas algorithm does not gamble with the verity of the result ; it only gambles with the resources used for the computation . A simple example is randomized quicksort , where the pivot is chosen randomly , but the result is always sorted . The usual definition of a Las Vegas algorithm includes the restriction that the expected run time always be finite , when the expectation is carried out over the space of random information , or entropy , used in the algorithm . Las Vegas algorithms were introduced by LÃ szlÃ Babai in 1979 , in the context of the graph isomorphism problem , as a stronger version of Monte Carlo algorithms . Las Vegas algorithms can be used in situations where the number of possible solutions is relatively limited , and where verifying the correctness of a candidate solution is relatively easy while actually calculating the solution is complex . The complexity class of decision problems that have Las Vegas algorithms with expected polynomial runtime is ZPP . which is intimately connected with the way Las Vegas algorithms are sometimes constructed . Namely the class RP consists of all decision problems for which a randomized polynomial-time algorithm exists that always answers correctly when the correct answer is `` no '' , but is allowed to be wrong with a certain probability bounded away from one when the answer is `` yes '' . When such an algorithm exists for both a problem and its complement ( with the answers `` yes '' and `` no '' swapped ) , the two algorithms can be run simultaneously and repeatedly : a few steps of each , taking turns , until one of them returns a definitive answer . This is the standard way to construct a Las Vegas algorithm that runs in expected polynomial time . Note that in general there is no worst case upper bound on the run time of a Las Vegas algorithm . Las Vegas algorithms can be contrasted with Monte Carlo algorithms , in which the resources used are bounded but the answer is not guaranteed to be correct 100 % of the time . By an application of Markov 's inequality , a Las Vegas algorithm can be converted into a Monte Carlo algorithm via early termination ( assuming the algorithm structure provides for such a mechanism ) .
Sadness was a survival horror game in development by Nibris for the Wii console , and was one of the earliest titles announced for the system . While the game initially drew positive attention for its unique gameplay concepts , such as black-and-white graphics and emphasis on psychological horror over violence , Sadness became notorious when no evidence of a playable build was ever publicly released during the four years it spent in development . It was revealed that Sadness had entered development hell due to problems with deadlines and relationships with outside developers , leading to its eventual cancellation by 2010 , along with the permanent closure of the company . Sadness was promoted as an unique and realistic survival horror game that would `` surprise players , '' focusing on psychological horror rather than violence , containing `` associations with narcolepsy , nyctophobia and paranoid schizophrenia . '' More notable was the announcement that the game would sport black-and-white visuals stylized as gothic horror . Nibris promised that Sadness would provide `` extremely innovative game play , '' fully utilizing the motion sensing capabilities of both the Wii Remote and the Nunchuk . For example , it was suggested that players would use the Wii Remote to wield a torch and wave it to scare off rats ; swinging the controller like a lasso in order to throw a rope over a wall ; or picking up items by reaching out with the Wii Remote and grabbing them . Sadness was also planned to have open-ended interactivity between the player and the game 's objects , being able to use any available item as a weapon . Suggestions included breaking a glass bottle and using the shards as a knife , or breaking the leg off a chair and using it as a club . The game would also not utilize in-game menus ( all game saves would be done in the background ) nor a HUD in favor of greater immersion . Set in pre-World War I Ukraine , Sadness was to follow the story of Maria Lengyel , a Victorian era aristocrat of Polish-Hungarian origin who has to protect her son Alexander after their train to Lviv derails in the countryside . Alexander , who is struck blind by the accident , begins to exhibit strange behavior that progressively worsens . The game 's scenarios and enemies , such as those based on the werewolf and the likho , are inspired by Slavic mythology . In order to `` make the player feel that he is participating in events ( and ) not merely playing a game , '' the game 's story was planned to be nonlinear , influenced by the player 's actions and concluding with one out of ten possible endings . Sadness was announced by Nibris on March 7 , 2006 as a title for Nintendo 's Revolution ( before its final name `` Wii '' was announced ) , later releasing a live action concept trailer which demonstrated potential Wii Remote control in gameplay . Nibris partnered with Frontline Studios , who would be in charge of programming Sadness , and Digital Amigos , who would develop the game visuals , and it was reported that the game would be released by the fourth quarter of 2007 . From 2007 onward , Nibris drew criticism from various websites and blogs for the lack of playable demos , trailers , or even screenshots of the game in action . Speculation that Sadness was nothing but vaporware intensified after Frontline Studios announced in April 2007 that it was no longer working on the project ( citing `` artistic differences '' ) , when Nibris made announcements that were never realized , such as a new trailer by late 2007 or an appearance at the 2008 Game Developer 's Conference , cessation of updates on Nibris ' official website , and finally the game 's delay to 2009 . Destructoid chose to stop covering Sadness following the delay , doubting the game 's existence and citing the lack of proof outside of concept art and `` fancy talk . '' Joystiq labeled Sadness as both a `` comedy of errors '' and a `` public embarrassment . '' Fog Studios , Nibris ' marketing partner , responded to the accusations on vaporware on at least two occasions , once in June 2008 and again in September 2009 , insisting that Sadness development was still underway , but was in need of a publisher . In May 2009 , N-Europe interviewed Adam Artur Antolski , an ex-Nibris employee and scriptwriter for Sadness , who revealed that the game 's delays were caused by prolonged dispute over the game design , which led to constant failures to meet deadlines . Antolski asserted that because no consensus could be made among the staff and with Frontline , the only progress made during the first year was completion of the script , concept design , and `` only one 3D object - some minecart I believe . '' When asked regarding the announcement that Nibris would be present at that year 's Electronic Entertainment Expo , Antolski expressed skepticism , stating that `` Nibris always was better in promoting than making anything . '' As such , Nibris did not appear at E3 2009 , and the game ultimately missed the projected Autumn 2009 release date . Finally , on April 5 , 2010 , N-Europe reported that Arkadiusz Reikowski , one of the game 's music composers , released some of his unfinished work to the public and confirmed that Sadness had been abandoned by Nibris and was no longer in the works .
Periodate ( pÉ Ë raÉ . É deÉ t ) is an anion composed of iodine and oxygen . Periodates include two forms . The metaperiodate ion is IO4 â ' ; the orthoperiodate ion is IO65 â ' . Usually both forms are called periodates . Periodate is the conjugate base of periodic acid . In neutral or weak acid conditions , IO4 â ' is most common , in equilibrium with a smaller amount of H4IO6 â ' . In basic conditions , H3IO62 â ' is formed , plus some other ions . Like its neighbor , tellurium , and unlike lighter halogens , iodine tends to be hexacoordinate , and the units HnIO6 ( 5 â n ) - are quite common ; but tetracoordinate units , such as IO4 â ' , are also quite common with iodine , tetracoordinate being the only form possible with lighter perhalogenates , such as perchlorate . Sodium metaperiodate can be isolated from the oxidation of sodium iodide with sodium hypochlorite and is best recrystallized from nitric acid . However , electrochemistry offers an easier alternative . Periodates can cleave carbon-carbon bonds when both carbon atoms bear an oxygen atom , either in the form of a hydroxyl or a carbonyl group . This property is often utilized in molecular biochemistry for the purposes of modifying saccharide rings , as many five - and six-membered sugars often have vicinal diols .

Verona Rupes is a cliff on Miranda , a moon of Uranus . The cliff face has been estimated to be from 5 kilometers ( 3 mi ) to 10 kilometers ( 6.2 mi ) high , which makes it the tallest known cliff in the solar system . It may have been created by a major impact , which caused the moon to disrupt and reassemble , or by the crust rifting .
Pardies is a commune in the PyrÃ nÃ es-Atlantiques department in south-western France .
Its capital city is RÃ cents mnicu VÃ cents lcea . In 2004 , it had a population of 416,908 and the population density was 71.7 \/ kmÂ . This county has a total area of 5,765 kmÂ . The North side of the county is occupied by the mountains from the Southern Carpathians group - The FÄ gÄ raÅ Mountains in the East with heights over 2200 m , and the Lotru Mountains in the West with heights over 2000 m. They are separated by the Olt River valley - the most accessible passage between Transylvania and Wallachia . Along the Olt River Valley there are smaller groups of mountains , the most spectacular being the Cozia Mountains . Towards the South , the heights decrease , passing through the sub-carpathian hills to a high plain in the West side of the Romanian Plain . The main river is the Olt River crossing the county from North to South . Its main affluents are the Lotru River in the North and the OlteÅ # River in the South . The city of RÃ cents mnicu VÃ cents lcea is the most industrialised in the county , the rest of the county having an agrarian development . In the West of the county coal and salt are extracted . The area in the center of the county is well suited for fruit orchards , wines and raising cattle . The South is better suited for growing cereals and vegetables . More information about Valcea County economy on Valcea Chamber of Commerce and Industry http://www.ccivl.ro VÃ cents lcea County is administered by a County Council , elected in the June 2008 local government elections , and is made up of 32 councillors , headed by Ion CÃ lea from the Social Democratic Party as President .

The Adur is a river in Sussex , England ; it gives its name to the Adur district of West Sussex . The river was formerly navigable for large vessels up as far as Steyning , where there was a large port , but over time the river valley became silted up and the port moved down to the deeper waters nearer the mouth in Shoreham-by-Sea . The Adur begins as two separate branches , the western Adur and the eastern Adur , which meet just west of Henfield at Betley Bridge . The western Adur rises at Slinfold from where it flows around Coolham and then through Shipley , where it meets Lancing Brook and flows on to West Grinstead and Knepp Castle . The western Adur is tidal as far north as Bines Bridge near Bines Green , south of West Grinstead . The eastern Adur rises at Ditchling Common , in East Sussex , from where it crosses into West Sussex and meets another major stream at Twineham . At Shermanbury , the eastern Adur is fed by the Cowfold Stream . From west of Henfield , the two branches of the river meet , before flowing between Upper Beeding and Bramber , past Coombes , through a gap in the South Downs near Lancing College where the Adur is fed by the Ladywell Stream . The river continues on to the English Channel at Shoreham-by-Sea . The mouth of the Adur is now two miles ( 3 km ) from the town center of Shoreham due to longshore drift . The Baybridge Canal uses part of the Adur 's watercourse . The name Adur is a relatively recent ( 17th Century ) invention , based on the name of the Roman fort Portus Adurni which was mistakenly believed to be at Shoreham . The river had previously been known as the Sore . From Norman times the county of Sussex was divided into sections known as rapes . Each rape was typically centred on a river and river port and was guarded by a castle . Bramber rape was centred on the port of Bramber and the river Adur , with Bramber Castle located close to the river . At various times in the medieval period , Bramber , Steyning and New Shoreham were all major ports on the river . The western Adur also flows close to Knepp Castle , near Shipley .
The anticipated 1916 Summer Olympics , which were to be officially known as the Games of the VI Olympiad , were to have been held in Berlin , Germany . However , due to the outbreak of World War I , the games were canceled . Work on the stadium , the Deutsches Stadion ( `` German Stadium '' ) , began in 1912 at what was the Grunewald Race Course . It was planned to seat over 18,000 spectators . On June 8 , 1913 the stadium was dedicated with the release of 10,000 pigeons . 60,000 people were in attendance . At the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , organization continued as no one anticipated that the war would continue for several years . Eventually , though , the Games were canceled . Alexandria and Budapest had also bid unsuccessfully for the 1916 Games . A winter sports week with speed skating , figure skating , ice hockey and nordic skiing was planned ; the concept of this week eventually gave rise to the Winter Olympics . The central venue was to have been the Deutsches Stadion , which was built in 1912 â `` 13 . Berlin returned to Olympic bidding in 1931 , when it beat Barcelona , Spain for the right to host the 1936 Summer Olympics .
Rolf RÃ 1\/4 ssmann ( 13 October 1950 â `` 2 October 2009 ) was a German football player . In 1969 FC Schalke 04 paid FC Schwelm 06 38,000 Deutsche Mark to sign promising stopper Rolf RÃ 1\/4 ssmann , who did not enjoy the best of starts at the Gelsenkirchen-based outfit under Rudi Gutendorf , but then gained more regular appearances for the club and seemed destined for a successful career . A German Cup winner with FC Schalke 04 in 1972 his career was brought to a halt after evidence proved RÃ 1\/4 ssmann was one of those players of FC Schalke 04 that got bribed by Arminia Bielefeld for fixing the result of a head-to-head Bundesliga match of both clubs on 17 April 1971 , for the benefit of Bielefeld . Initially RÃ 1\/4 ssmann ( among other Schalke players ) had controverted those claims . RÃ 1\/4 Ã mann was one of the crop of players that committed perjury in the affair and got , as a consequence , punished with a fine by a court in 1975 . In 1973 ( and shortly in the course of the 1976 â `` 1977 season ) RÃ 1\/4 ssmann was banned temporarily from club action by the German Football Association , but given the allowance for appearances in foreign leagues . So he left FC Schalke 04 in 1973 to see out his Bundesliga ban with Belgian outfit Club Brugge ( 11 matches , 0 goals ) . Returning to Schalke afterwards , RÃ 1\/4 ssmann stayed on with the club until December 1980 . Cash-strapped , Schalke had to sell him to arch-rival side Borussia Dortmund at that time with RÃ 1\/4 Ã mann staying on at Westfalenstadion until he retired in 1985 after 43 goals in 453 Bundesliga matches . A respected youth international for West Germany , RÃ 1\/4 ssmann was already on the verge of a West Germany debut in 1971 , but then saw his hopes ruined by his role in the match fixing Bundesligaskandal . Six years after the scandal , he was enjoying a bright season with his club and the German Football Association had eased their restrictions concerning players involved in the scandal ( see Klaus Fischer ) in the meantime , RÃ 1\/4 ssmann was re-called by Helmut SchÃ n to debut for the West Germans in a friendly win against Yugoslavia . Steady performances lead to more call-up 's and regular caps resulted in RÃ 1\/4 ssmann earning a spot in the 1978 FIFA World Cup squad of West Germany . He came to action in all six matches , but after their ( early ) elimination he did feature just one more time for his nation in the rest of his career . In total RÃ 1\/4 ssmann won 20 caps , scoring one goal ( winning goal versus the Soviet Union ) . In 1987 RÃ 1\/4 ssmann returned to FC Schalke 04 as an off-pitch authority and was general-manager of the club from 25 February to 10 August 1987 . With Borussia MÃ nchengladbach 's veteran general-manager Helmut Grashoff looking for a successor , RÃ 1\/4 ssmann started to work as assistant to Grashoff at MÃ nchengladbach in April 1990 and got Grashoff 's replacement later on . On 8 July 1992 , RÃ 1\/4 ssmann was sacked by MÃ nchengladbach , but re-appointed by the club in September 1992 due to a change of view inside the MÃ nchengladbach presidium . On 10 November 1998 , RÃ 1\/4 Ã mann was finally out of the door at MÃ nchengladbach following a complete change of environment caused by an ongoing desasterous run of results in the Bundesliga since 1996 . From 1 February 2001 , RÃ 1\/4 ssmann was general-manager of Bundesliga side VfB Stuttgart , getting the sack by Die Schwaben in December 2002 . He died on 2 October 2009 from prostate cancer less than two weeks before he would have turned 59 .
`` Bubble Cars '' have proved popular for preservation on heritage railways . The Class 123 was a design of Diesel Multiple Unit built for British Rail in 1963 . They were built by British Rail at Swindon Works , and designed like all Swindon units as inter-city sets . Ten of the four-car sets were built and introduced in 1963 . The units bear a visible similarity to the British Rail Class 309 , however there is no ` relation ' here as the two types were built by different manufacturers for different markets . The Class 123 's structure and internal construction have much more in common with BR coaching stock ( British Rail Mark 1 ) than they do with other DMU classes . The carriage 's underframes are longer and the end gangways are built to a different style . It was also unusual for a first-generation DMU to sport a front end gangway .

A Caesar salad is a salad of romaine lettuce and croutons dressed with parmesan cheese , lemon juice , olive oil , egg , Worcestershire sauce , and black pepper . It may be prepared tableside . The salad 's creation is generally attributed to restaurateur Caesar Cardini , an Italian-born Mexican . Cardini was living in San Diego but also working in Tijuana where he avoided the restrictions of Prohibition . His daughter Rosa ( 1928 â `` 2003 ) recounted that her father invented the dish when a Fourth of July 1924 rush depleted the kitchen 's supplies . Cardini made do with what he had , adding the dramatic flair of the table-side tossing `` by the chef . '' A number of Cardini 's staff have claimed to have invented the dish . Julia Child claimed to have eaten a Caesar salad at Cardini 's restaurant when she was a child in the 1920s . The earliest contemporary documentation of Caesar Salad is a 1946 Los Angeles restaurant menu , twenty years after the 1924 origin asserted by the Cardinis . The original Caesar salad recipe ( unlike Alex 's Aviator 's salad ) did not contain pieces of anchovy ; the slight anchovy flavor comes from the Worcestershire sauce . Cardini was opposed to using anchovies in his salad . In the 1970s , Cardini 's daughter said that the original recipe included whole lettuce leaves , which were meant to be lifted by the stem and eaten with the fingers ; coddled eggs ; and Italian olive oil . The trademarks `` Cardini 's '' , `` Caesar Cardini 's '' and `` The Original Caesar Dressing '' are all claimed to date to February 1950 , though they were only registered decades later , and more than a dozen varieties of bottled Cardini 's dressing are available today . Some recipes include mustard , avocado , tomato , bacon bits , garlic cloves or anchovies . Cardini 's Brand original Caesar dressing is somewhat different from Rosa 's version . Many restaurants offer a more substantial salad by topping a Caesar salad with grilled chicken , steak , or seafood . Certain Mexican restaurants may improvise on items such as substituting tortilla strips for croutons and Cotija cheese for the Parmesan , or the addition of tomatoes . There is potential risk of infection by salmonella bacteria occasionally found in raw egg from cracked or improperly washed eggshells . This is a concern with many similar dressings that are emulsified with eggs , though generally the pH level is thought to be acidic enough to kill those bacteria . Nevertheless , later versions of the recipe call at least for briefly-cooked coddled eggs or pasteurized eggs . Recipes may omit the egg and produce a `` Caesar vinaigrette '' . Yogurt is sometimes substituted for the eggs to maintain a creamy texture .

The McIntosh Red ( or McIntosh ; colloquially , the Mac ) is an apple cultivar with red and green skin , a tart flavor , and tender white flesh . It ripens in late September . It is traditionally the most popular cultivar in Eastern Canada and New England , well known for the pink applesauce unpeeled McIntoshes make . It is also well-suited for cider and pies . It is common to find this cultivar packed in children 's lunches in North America owing to its small to medium size and longstanding reputation as a healthy snack . Every McIntosh apple has a direct lineage to a single tree discovered in 1811 by John McIntosh on his farm in Dundela , a hamlet near Morrisburg , in Dundas County , Ontario , Canada . He discovered the tree as one of 20 apple seedlings while clearing the farm , which he had just purchased . He transplanted the seedlings , cultivated them , and only one of them was still alive by 1830 . The surviving apple tree lived until 1906 . The Snow Apple , also known as the Fameuse , is believed to be a parent of the McIntosh . Offspring of the Mac include , among many others , the firmer Macoun ( a Jersey Black cross ) , the Spartan ( recorded as a Newtown Pippin cross ) , the Cortland , the Empire , the Jonamac , the Jersey Mac and possibly the Paula Red . The McIntosh was the source of the name of Apple 's Macintosh computer . In a 1965 episode of Get Smart titled `` Too Many Chiefs '' , KAOS impersonator Alexei Sebastian , pretending to be the Chief , tricks Maxwell Smart with a false new code sign : `` I say Apples and you say McIntosh .

Alphanumeric ( sometimes shortened to alphameric ) is a combination of alphabetic and numeric characters , and is used to describe the collection of Latin letters and Arabic digits or a text counstructed from this collection . There are either 36 ( single case ) or 62 ( case-sensitive ) alphanumeric characters . The alphanumeric character set consists of the numbers 0 to 9 and letters A to Z. In computing terminology , a character stored in alphanumeric form may potentially occupy less space than storing an 8-bit ASCII character , as each character requires only 6 bits for encoding . There is no standard for storing 6-bit alphanumeric data . A 6-bit field has 64 possible values , so if only 36 are used in single case , there is room for another 28 characters ( usually slashes and other punctuation ) , making alphanumeric data useful for storing text and website addresses . When a string of mixed alphabets and numerals is presented for human interpretation , ambiguities arise . The most obvious is the similarity of the letters I , O and Q to the numbers 1 and 0 . Therefore , depending on the application , various subsets of the alphanumeric were adopted to avoid-misinterpretation by humans . In passenger aircraft , aircraft seat maps and seats were designated by row number followed by column letter . For wide bodied jets , the seats can be 10 across , labeled ABC-DEFG-HJK . The letter I is skipped to avoid mistaking it as row number 1 . In Vehicle Identification Number used by motor vehicle manufacturers , the letters I , O and Q are omitted for their similarity to 1 or 0 . Tiny embossed letters are used to label pins on an V. 35\/M34 electrical connector . The letters I , O , Q , S and Z were dropped to ease eye strain with 1 , 0 , 5 , and 2 . That subset is named DEC Alphabet after the company that first used it . For alphanumerics that are frequently handwritten , in addition to I and O , V is avoided because it looks like U in cursive , and Z for its similarity to 2 . In the TV show ReBoot , `` alphanumeric '' was an interjection used by Enzo as an equivalent of `` cool ! '' or `` awesome ! '' In the episode `` Talent Night '' , it was used to mean `` everything is all right . ''

Oval tube station in Kennington is a station on the Northern line of the London Underground between Stockwell and Kennington stations . It is the only station on the Morden branch of the Northern line whose name begins with a vowel and is one of only two stations on the London Underground with only four letters in its name ( the only other being Bank ) . Oval station is in Travelcard Zone 2 . It is named after The Oval , which it serves . The station is located at the junction of Kennington Park Road ( heading north-east ) , Camberwell New Road ( south-east ) , Clapham Road ( south west ) and Harleyford Street ( north west ) and is about 500 yards from the Oval cricket ground . It opened on 18 December 1890 as part of the City & South London Railway . Also close by are Kennington Park and the imposing St Mark 's Church . The station has cricket-themed decorations , with murals , statues and banners all celebrating the illustrious game . The station building was rebuilt in the early 1920s when the line was modernized and was refurbished during late 2007\/early 2008 at street level with a modern tiling scheme inside and out , giving the station a more modern look . Reflecting its proximity to the cricket ground , the internal decorative tiling features large images of cricketers in various stances . Oval tube station was the intended site of one of the attempted London bombings on 21 July 2005 . London Bus routes 3 , 36 , 59 , 133 , 155 , 159 , 185 , 333 , 415 , 436 and Night routes N133 , N136 , N155 and N159 all serve the station and its surrounding areas .
The Manitoba Moose are a professional ice hockey team in the American Hockey League . They play in Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada , at the MTS Centre . In 1996 the Minnesota Moose moved north from St. Paul , Minnesota , to fill the vacated Winnipeg Arena , becoming the Manitoba Moose . At the time , they were a member of the IHL , and enjoyed moderate regular season and playoff success under head coach and former Winnipeg Jets player Randy Carlyle . When the IHL folded , the Manitoba Moose joined the AHL and became the official farm team of the Vancouver Canucks . Upon joining the AHL , former Canuck player Stan Smyl became the Moose coach . However , he was later replaced by Randy Carlyle . Carlyle soon acquired a job with the Anaheim Ducks , and Alain Vigneault was hired for one season , before himself being called up to the Vancouver Canucks . Scott Arniel , himself a former Winnipeg Jet and Manitoba Moose , was hired as head coach . In his third year as a coach in the AHL , Arniel was awarded the Louis A. R. Pieri Memorial Award as AHL coach of the year in 2009 . Arniel was hired by the Columbus Blue Jackets replacing interim head coach Claude Noel . Noel was later hired by the Moose to replace Arniel in 2010 . In November 2004 , the Manitoba Moose unveiled their new logo , and officially opened the new downtown arena in Winnipeg known as the MTS Centre . In the spring of 2009 , the Moose played in their first ever Calder Cup Finals against the Hershey Bears . They lost the best of seven series 4-2 . With speculation in 2010 that the Phoenix Coyotes could be brought back to Winnipeg ( through a deal involving Moose-partner Mark Chipman and David Thomson ) should the franchise fail to find a new owner in its current city , it has been speculated that the Manitoba Moose franchise would then move to Thunder Bay , Ontario if an NHL team does come to Winnipeg . In the second round of the 2009 Calder Cup Playoffs the Moose achieved their very first playoff sweep in franchise history , winning the series 4-0 against the Grand Rapids Griffins . After beating the Houston Aeros 3-1 for a 4 games to 2 Western Conference final on May 25 , 2009 , the Moose advanced to the Calder Cup Championship series for the first time . They faced the previous year 's winner , the Hershey Bears . Game 1 of the 2009 Calder Cup Championship series in Winnipeg was sold out with 15,003 fans ( largest crowd in Game 1 of the AHL Final history ) cheering on the Moose , the Moose ultimately lost the game in overtime to Hershey . Game 2 of the 2009 Calder Cup Championship series included a Jason Jaffray hat trick . The first on a power play at 7:59 in the second period tying the game at one . The second came with 47 seconds left in the third , being the game winner . His third goal was an empty net power play goal at 19:50 . The final attendance was 14,737 , a successful first two games for the Moose headed off to Hershey , with almost 30,000 people in attendance . Games 3 and 4 had two wins for the Bears and only one goal scored by the Moose in the two games by Raymond Sawada . Game 3 was 3-0 and 4 was 2-1 . The series was now at 3-1 for the Hershey Bears . Going into Game 5 the Giant Center was sold out for the third time with 10,860 tickets sold besides the capacity of 10,500 . It was the largest crowd in Giant Center history ready to see the Calder Cup . The Moose had something to say about that . At 17:00 in the second period , Michael Grabner put one past goaltender Michal Neuvirth . 67 later Cody Hodgson put another one past him . After a goal from Hershey 's Graham Mink , an empty net goal by Jason Krog and another Hershey goal with 30 seconds left , the Moose made the series 3-2 going back to the MTS Centre for games 6 & 7 . Cory Schneider received first star in game 5 with 31 saves and the Giant Center held 31,860 fans for all three games . Goals : 45 Scott Thomas ( 1998 â `` 99 ) Assists : 81 Stephane Morin ( 1994 â `` 95 ) Points : 114 Stephane Morin ( 1994 â `` 95 ) Penalty minutes : 285 Wade Brookbank ( 2004 â `` 05 ) Wins : 35 Cory Schneider ( 2009-10 ) GAA : 2.04 Cory Schneider ( 2008-09 ) SV % : .928 Cory Schneider ( 2008-09 ) These are the top-ten point-scorers in franchise history .

Salamandridae is a family of salamanders consisting of true salamanders and newts . There are currently 74 species ( with more expected ) spread all over the northern hemisphere - Europe , Asia , the northern tip of Africa and North America . Salamandrids are distinguished from other salamanders by the lack of rib or costal grooves along the sides of the body , and usually have rough skin . Salamandrids generally have patterns of bright and contrasting colors , although there are a few exceptions . They have four well-developed limbs , with four toes on the forelimbs , and ( in most cases ) five toes on the hindlimbs . They vary from 7 c to 30 c in length . The Alpine salamander and Lanza 's fire salamander give birth to live young , without a tadpole stage , but the other species lay their eggs in water . Some newts are neotenic , being able to reproduce before they are fully metamorphosed . The genera Chioglossa , Lyciasalamandra , Mertensiella and Salamandra are grouped in the subfamily Salamandrinae , the rest in Pleurodelinae . Those with a more thoroughly aquatic lifestyle are referred to as `` newts '' , but this is not a formal taxonomic description .
The manticore ( Early Middle Persian Martyaxwar ; Î ' Î Ï á 1\/4 Î Î Ï Baricos in Greek ) is a legendary creature similar to the Egyptian sphinx . It has the body of a red lion , a human head with three rows of sharp teeth ( like a shark ) , and a trumpet-like voice . Other aspects of the creature vary from story to story . It may be horned , winged , or both . The tail is that of either a dragon or a scorpion , and it may shoot poisonous spines to either paralyze or kill its victims . It devours its prey whole . It leaves no clothes , bones , or possessions of the prey behind . During the early centuries , it was often believed that when a person would go missing , it was evidence that it was caused by a manticore and that manticore were real . The creature 's feet may be those of a dragon , but are most often described as the paws of a lion . Its size ranges from the size of a lion to the size of a horse . It is also mistaken as a bearded man when seen from a distance . The manticore myth was of Persian origin , where its name was `` man-eater '' ( from early Middle Persian Ù Ø Ø Ø Û Ø martya `` man '' ( as in human ) and Ø Ù Ø Ø xwar - `` to eat '' ) . The English term `` manticore '' was borrowed from Latin mantichora , itself borrowed from Greek Î 1\/4 Î Î 1\/2 Ï Î Ï Ï Ï Î Ï â '' an erroneous pronunciation of the original Persian name . It passed into European folklore first through a remark by Ctesias , a Greek physician at the Persian court of King Artaxerxes II in the fourth century BC , in his notes on India ( `` Indika '' ) , which circulated among Greek writers on natural history but have not survived . The Romanised Greek Pausanias , in his Description of Greece , recalled strange animals he had seen at Rome and commented , Pliny the Elder did not share Pausanias ' skepticism . He followed Aristotle 's natural history by including the martichorasâ '' mistranscribed as manticorus in his copy of Aristotle and thus passing into European languagesâ '' among his descriptions of animals in Naturalis Historia , c. 77 AD . Later , in The Life of Apollonius of Tyana Greek writer Flavius Philostratus ( c. 170-247 ) wrote : Pliny 's book was widely enjoyed and uncritically believed through the European Middle Ages , during which the manticore was sometimes illustrated in bestiaries . The manticore made a late appearance in heraldry , during the 16th century , and it influenced some Mannerist representations , as in Bronzino 's allegory The Exposure of Luxury , ( National Gallery , London ) â '' but more often in the decorative schemes called `` grotteschi '' â '' of the sin of Fraud , conceived as a monstrous chimera with a beautiful woman 's face , and in this way it passed by means of Cesare Ripa 's Iconologia into the seventeenth and eighteenth century French conception of a sphinx .
In linguistics , mutual intelligibility is recognized as a relationship between languages in which speakers of different but related languages can readily understand each other without intentional study or extraordinary effort . It is sometimes used as a criterion for distinguishing languages from dialects , though sociolinguistic factors are also important . Intelligibility between languages can be asymmetric , with speakers of one understanding more of the other than speakers of the other understand of the first . It is when it is relatively symmetric that it is characterized as ` mutual ' . It exists in differing degrees among many related or geographically proximate languages of the world , often in the context of a dialect continuum . For individuals to achieve moderate proficiency or understanding in a language ( called L2 ) other than their mother tongue or first language ( L1 ) typically requires considerable time and effort through study and\/or practical application . However , for those many groups of languages displaying mutual intelligibility , namely , those , usually genetically related languages , similar to each other in grammar , vocabulary , pronunciation , or other features , speakers of one language usually find it relatively easy to achieve some degree of understanding in the related language ( s ) . Languages mutually intelligible but not genetically related may be creoles and parent languages . Intelligibility among languages can vary between individuals or groups within a language population , according to their knowledge of various registers and vocabulary in their own language , their interest in or familiarity with other cultures , the domain of discussion , psycho-cognitive traits , the mode of language used ( written vs. oral ) , and other factors . According to some definitions , two or more languages that demonstrate a sufficiently high degree of mutual intelligibility should properly not be considered two distinct languages but , in fact , multiple varieties of the same language . Conversely , it is sometimes the case that different varieties of what is considered the same languageâ '' according to popular belief , governmental stance , or historical conventionâ '' are not , in fact , mutually intelligible in practice . Asymmetric intelligibility is a term used by linguists on two languages that are considered mutually intelligible , but one group would find it harder to understand the other . Portuguese and Spanish have a relationship like this , as Portuguese speakers would find it easier to understand Spanish than vice versa . Russian and Ukrainian also have a relation like this , as Russians may not understand Ukrainian very well , while Ukrainians could understand Russian much better , possibly due to more exposure of the other language . Norwegian BokmÃ l , Standard Danish and Standard Swedish also have a relationship like this , as speakers of Danish can understand Norwegian and Swedish better than vice versa .
Maple syrup urine disease ( MSUD ) , also called branched-chain ketoaciduria , is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder affecting branched-chain amino acids . It is one type of organic acidemia . The condition gets its name from the distinctive sweet odor of affected infants ' urine . MSUD is caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex ( BCKDC ) , leading to a buildup of the branched-chain amino acids ( leucine , isoleucine , and valine ) and their toxic by-products in the blood and urine . The disease is characterized in an infant by the presence of sweet-smelling urine , with an odor similar to that of maple syrup . Infants with this disease seem healthy at birth but if left untreated suffer severe brain damage and eventually die . From early infancy , symptoms of the condition include poor feeding , vomiting , dehydration , lethargy , hypotonia , seizures , hypoglycemia , ketoacidosis , opisthotonus , pancreatitis , coma and neurological decline . Maple syrup urine disease can be classified by its pattern of signs and symptoms , or by its genetic cause . The most common and severe form of the disease is the classic type , which appears soon after birth . Variant forms of the disorder may appear later in infancy or childhood and are typically less severe , but still involve mental and physical problems if left untreated . Keeping MSUD under control requires careful monitoring of blood chemistry and involves both a special diet and frequent testing . A diet with minimal levels of the amino acids leucine , isoleucine , and valine must be maintained in order to prevent neurological damage . As these three amino acids are required for proper metabolic function in all people , specialized protein preparations containing substitutes and adjusted levels of the amino acids have been synthesized and tested , allowing MSUD patients to meet normal nutritional requirements without causing harm . Usually , patients are also monitored by a dietitian . Their diet must be adhered to strictly and permanently . However , with proper management those afflicted are able to live healthy , normal lives and not suffer the severe neurological damage associated with the disease . Maple syrup urine disease affects approximately 1 out of 180,000 infants . Due in part to the founder effect , however , MSUD has a much higher prevalence in children of Amish , Mennonite , and Jewish descent . These four genes produce proteins that work together as the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex . The complex is essential for breaking down the amino acids leucine , isoleucine , and valine , which are present in many kinds of food ( particularly protein-rich foods such as milk , meat , and eggs ) . Mutations in any of these genes reduce or eliminate the function of the enzyme complex , preventing the normal breakdown of isoleucine , leucine , and valine . As a result , these amino acids and their by-products build up in the body . Because high levels of these substances are toxic to the brain and other organs , this accumulation leads to the serious medical problems associated with maple syrup urine disease . This condition has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern , which means the defective gene is located on an autosome , and two copies of the gene - one from each parent - must be inherited to be affected by the disorder . The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the defective gene , but are usually not affected by the disorder .
Rip Slyme ( often stylized as RIP SLYME ) is a Japanese hip hop group . It is composed of 4 MCs ; Ryo-Z , Ilmari , Pes & Su , and 1 DJ , Fumiya . Their sound derives its influences from old school hip hop and other Hip Hop such as The Pharcyde , De La Soul , Public Enemy , Jurassic 5 , the Beastie Boys , DJ Premier , Leaders of the New School . The group was formed in 1994 by Ryo-Z and Ilmari , who were later joined by Pes ( he attended the same school as Ilmari ) . The Rip in Rip Slyme stands for their initials . Slyme was a popular children 's toy at that time . Their name is also a pun on the phrase `` lips ' rhyme '' . Winning an amateur rapping contest `` Young MCs In Town '' , they started their musical career with their first album Lips Rhyme in 1995 . Later they added DJ Fumiya ( who had studied under East End X Yuri 's DJ Yoggy ) and Su ( previously a backup dancer for East End X Yuri ) . In 1998 they released their second album , `` Talkin ' Cheap '' and also took part in Dragon Ash 's Total Communication event . They became ever more successful and signed to Warner Music Group in 2000 . By then they had release several indie singles include their EP `` Underline No. 5 '' and `` Mata Au Hi Made '' which had received the help of Fantastic Plastic Machine . `` Mata Au Hi Made '' was released on Warner Music Group 's Indies label . Their first major single was `` Stepper 's Delight '' released 22 March 2001 . The title was a play on The Sugarhill Gang 's `` Rapper 's Delight '' . In general , Fumiya composes most of the music , while Ryo-Z , Pes , Ilmari , and Su write their own lyrics . However , before Fumiya became a member , Pes composed most of the songs . Each member has tried their hand at composing music for Rip Slyme , and Pes occasionally plays guitar on some tracks ( Such as Home and More & More , for example ) . Allegedly , Pes was in a rock band before being introduced to hip hop music by Ilmari and Ryo-Z . In 2002 they received MTV Video Music Awards Japan for `` Best Newcomer '' and `` Best Hip-hop Group '' . The same year they released a big-budget album `` Tokyo Classic '' , which became Japan 's first million-selling hip-hop album , with a sound compared to James Brown 's soul and funk . Two singles from the album , `` Funkastic '' and `` Rakuen Baby '' collected MTV awards in 2003 . `` Super Shooter '' , featured as a B-side to their single `` Galaxy '' , is the theme song for the anime Gantz . To date they have released 6 indies singles with 17 major singles . They as well have released 2 indie albums , 7 major albums , 1 live album , 1 indies collection album , and 1 best of album . From late 2005 ( after the release of Good Job in August ) through 2006 , DJ Fumiya has been on extended break , citing illness . For performances , a friend of the band by the name of DJ Soma has been standing in . Fumiya 's break has led to several interesting side projects and collaborations from other members . Fumiya is supposed to have returned to activity for concerts in late summer 2006 . He has returned for the latest Rip Slyme release , Epoch . On 7 July 2007 Rip Slyme performed their single `` Nettaiya '' at Live Earth in Kyoto , Japan . Later that year , they would go on to release their fifteenth major single , Speed King , and their seventh Warner album , Funfair , shortly after . In summer 2008 , they released Taiyou to Bikini , their only single that year . Later that year , three digital singles would debut , all of which would be on the February 2009 single Stairs . Rip Slyme released their eighth album , Journey , on June 10 , 2009 . Rip Slyme has provided voiceover work as well as the ending theme for the Japanese dub of SpongeBob Squarepants . The episode aired on May 6 , 2009 .
Yuji Okuma ( born 19 January 1969 ) is a former Japanese football player .
The Grimsby & Immingham Electric Railway was an electric tramway linking Grimsby with the port of Immingham in Lincolnshire , England . It is probably best described by the American term `` interurban '' as it ran on reserved track rather that through the streets . With silting problems occurring at Grimsby , a problem with that site since it was first used by the monks of the local priory , the owners of the docks , the Great Central Railway company were forced to look elsewhere in order to maintain and strengthen their hold on seaborne traffic on the River Humber . The company were looking for a site which could be made accessible at all states of the tide to vessels of up to 6,000 gross registered tons ( grt ) . Taking into account the fact that the deep water channel of the river comes nearest the south bank at Immingham this was chosen as the site for the new deep water dock and estate . Immingham village , and the land purchased for this new venture , were rather inaccessible by road , and the G.C.R. sent a delegation to Bristol and Cardiff , two cities where their docks were situated some distance from the center , the homes of the workforce . It seemed essential that direct communications between the town center at Grimsby and the new dock estate at Immingham would have to be built . The docks were opened in 1912 and with them the electric railway . At the grouping in 1923 the line became part of the London and North Eastern Railway and was nationalised in 1948 . Closure came in summer 1961 , with replacement by buses . The GCR reached agreement for the purchase of the land required and presented two Bills in Parliament of which the second was accepted as the Humber Commercial Railway and Dock Act 1904 . An application for a Light Railway Order was drawn by the GCR 's solicitor for a link between the dock estate and Grimsby . The railway portions were built first as to carry the goods necessary for the construction of the street tramway . Originally it was planned to use electric traction between Corporation Bridge , Grimsby and the Pyewipe Depot , where a change would be made to steam powered trains . The plans were amended in 1909 and electric traction was to be used throughout . The main line ran from Immingham Town to Grimsby ( Corporation Bridge ) and to this was added a short line from Immingham Town to Immingham Dock ( not to be confused with the main line railway station of the same name by the Western Jetty ) , to serve the workers who lived there and to take them and their families to Grimsby . The Immingham Dock - Town line was double track set on its own reserved way but becoming a street tramway once reaching the village . Trams reversed towards Grimsby and the line and once on their reserved way maintained a south-eastward course across the marshes on a near straight five-mile stretch to Pyewipe depot . Along this section were constructed seven passing points , three closing in 1917 . They were not known by name but titled , for example , `` No. 4 Passing Point '' etc. . The system also included a short Immingham branch to serve the new locomotive depot and a station was opened in Queens Road near the footpath linking the line to the depot . This line had `` an occasional and irregular service '' . At the depot , the line veered to the right to become a street tramway , using Gilbey Road and finally Corporation Road . This was single track with three passing points . A waiting room and parcels office were built next to Corporation Bridge as the Grimsby terminus . An extension over Corporation Bridge project was authorised but never built , as work on the reconstruction of Corporation Bridge took too long , finishing only in 1928 . The Corporation Road and Gilbey Road section was cut back in 1956 . The section from Corporation Bridge to Immingham was closed in 1961 Direct current electric power was supplied by two substations . The first was built three miles from Immingham by Siemens Brothers whose contract included the construction of the overhead line and the installation of 184 Baltic Redwood fir poles which would run alongside the line . Two Westinghouse 250 kW rotary converters produced 500 V DC for the trams . Traction feeders were installed every half mile . The substation itself was a redbrick construction , built by Dennis Gill & Sons of Doncaster for Â # 507 . The second substation , continuously manned , was also built by Dennis Gill , for Â # 707 , next to the car sheds at Pyewipe . It contained three 250 kW Westinghouse rotary converters . One converter was used for lighting , one for traction and the third as a standby . The curiously named sheds , taking their name from the local marshes , the habitat of the peewit ( curlew ) and known after its call , near the Grimsby Borough boundary , serviced all the trams . Pyewipe was built by H. Marrows for Â # 1464 . The sheds did not house the cars , which spent all their life outdoors , only entering the workshop if repairs were needed . The workshop had the capacity to hold three trams on two tracks and the depot the rest of the fleet . It also housed a machine shop and store .

Monkfish ( or Headfish ) is the English name of a number of types of fish in the northwest Atlantic , most notably the species of the anglerfish genus Lophius and the angelshark genus Squatina . The term is also occasionally used for a European sea monster more often called a sea monk . Monkfish is the most common English name for the genus Lophius in the northwest Atlantic but goosefish is used as the equivalent term on the eastern coast of North America . Lophius has three long filaments sprouting from the middle of the head ; these are the detached and modified three first spines of the anterior dorsal fin . As in most anglerfish species , the longest filament is the first ( illicium ) , which terminates in an irregular growth of flesh , the esca . This modified fin ray is movable in all directions . This esca is used as a lure to attract other fishes , which monkfish then typically swallow whole . Experiments have shown , however , that whether the prey has been attracted to the lure or not is not strictly relevant , as the action of the jaws is an automatic reflex triggered by contact with the esca . It grows to a length of more than 1.5 m ( 5 ft ) ; specimens of 1 m ( 3 ft ) are common . The largest recorded specimen caught weighed 99.4 kg ( 219 lbs ) . Two species Lophius piscatorius and Lophius budegassa are found in north-western Europe and referred to as monkfish , with L. piscatorius by far the most common species around the British Isles and of major fishery interest . Under UK Labelling Regulations , the phrase `` monkfish '' is only permitted for Lophiodes caulinaris , Lophius americanus , Lophius budegassa and Lophius piscatorius . In Europe and North America , the texture of the tail meat of fish of the genus Lophius , is sometimes compared to lobster tail and has been alluded to as the `` poor man 's lobster , '' although today it commands prices equivalent to , and in some cases exceeding , lobster and other marine delicacies . According to Seafood Watch , monkfish consumption raises sustainability concerns due to past overfishing and damage to the seafloor habitat resulting from the use of trawlers and gillnets to catch this fish . A second group of fish also known as monkfish are members of the genus Squatina , in the angel shark family Squatinidae . These are of somewhat similar shape to the anglerfish , but completely unrelated ; as they are elasmobranchs . These fish are only of minor significance for human consumption , though they are endangered because they are caught as bycatch by trawlers . Monkfish is commonly eaten in all northern and southern coastal regions of Spain , such as Catalonia , Valencia and Galicia .
Rho ( uppercase Î , lowercase Ï or Ï ; Ë roÊ ) is the 17th letter of the Greek alphabet . In the system of Greek numerals , it has a value of 100 . It is derived from Semitic resh `` head '' . Its uppercase form is not to be confused with the Latin letter P , although both are typeset using the same glyph . Rho is classed as a liquid consonant ( together with lambda and sometimes the nasals mu and nu ) , which has important implications for morphology . In both Ancient and Modern Greek , it represents a trilled or tapped r. In polytonic orthography a rho at the beginning of a word is written with a rough breathing ( equivalent to h ) â '' rh â '' and a double rho within a word is written with a smooth breathing over the first rho and a rough breathing over the second â '' rrh â '' apparently reflecting an aspirated or voiceless pronunciation in Ancient Greek , hence the various Greek-derived English words which start with rh or contain rrh . The name of the letter is written in Greek as ( polytonic ) or Ï Ï \/ Ï Î ( monotonic ) . Letters that arose from rho include Roman R and Cyrillic Er ( Ð ) . The characters Î , Ï and Ï are also used outside its Greek alphabetical context in science and mathematics . When rho is fused within a single typespace with the Greek letter Chi , it forms the labarum , which is used to represent Jesus Christ . Former Rhodes Scholars are entitled to use the Greek letter rho as a designation of their status . When used , the symbol should precede the name . Rho is encoded by & Rho ; in the upper case and & rho ; in the lower case .
The Second Geneva Convention , for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded , Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea , is one of the four treaties of the Geneva Conventions . It was first adopted in 1906 , after the Russo-Japanese war , but was significantly updated in 1929 and again in 1949 . It adapts the main protections of the First Geneva Convention to combat at sea . The treaty is a lengthy document consisting of 63 articles . The most essential provisions of the treaty are : For a detailed discussion of each article of the treaty , see the original text and the commentary . There are currently 194 countries party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions , including this second treaty but also including the other three .

`` Poisonous snake '' redirects here . For true poisonous snakes , see Rhabdophis . Venomous snakes are snakes which have venom glands and specialized teeth for the injection of venom . Members of the families Elapidae , Viperidae and Atractaspididae ( and some from Colubridae as well ) are major venomous snakes . Venomous snakes use modified saliva , snake venom , usually delivered through highly specialized teeth such as hollow fangs , for the purpose of prey immobilization and self-defense . In contrast , non-venomous species either constrict their prey , or simply overpower it with their jaws . Venomous snakes include several families of snakes and do not form a single taxonomic group . This has been interpreted to mean that venom in snakes originated more than once as the result of convergent evolution . Evidence has recently been presented for the Toxicofera hypothesis however ; venom was present ( in small amounts ) in the ancestor of all snakes ( as well as several lizard families ) as ` toxic saliva ' and evolved to extremes in those snake families normally classified as venomous by parallel evolution . The Toxicofera hypothesis further implies that ` non venomous ' snake lineages have either lost the ability to produce venom ( but may still have lingering venom pseudogenes ) , or actually do produce venom in small quantities , likely sufficient to assist in small prey capture , but cause no harm to humans if bitten . Lists or rankings of the world 's `` most venomous snakes '' are tentative and differ greatly due to numerous factors , including the recentness and reliability of the data , the number of species analyzed , and the testing methods used . Moreover , in terms of many other factors , the most venomous species may not always be the most dangerous ; for example , while the Russell 's viper , the Saw-scaled viper , the King cobra and the Black mamba have a significantly weaker venom than the Inland taipan , the prior two are responsible for far more deaths due to various factors ( such as their wide distributions and inconspicuous appearance ) , while the latter two cause higher mortality rates and a quicker death time in humans due to their high attack position and large dose of highly potent venom delivered . While there have been numerous studies on snake venom , potency estimates can vary , creating overlap and greatly complicating the task . Further , may be measured through intramuscular , intraperitoneal , intravenous or subcutaneous injections on small rodents , although the latter is the most applicable to actual bites . It should also be considered that mice , the most commonly used animals in determining LD50 , may react to some snake venoms differently than humans do . Thus , it remains difficult to compile such lists . Many of these lists only take into account of terrestrial and arboreal snakes and neglect to list the of venom of the sea snakes . Species of sea snakes have been listed to have more toxic venom than even that of the inland taipan and further investigations of some species ' venom are needed . Venomous snakes are often said to be poisonous , although this is not the correct term , as venoms and poisons are different . Poisons can be absorbed by the body , such as through the skin or digestive system , while venoms must first be introduced directly into tissues or the blood stream ( envenomated ) through mechanical means . It is , for example , therefore harmless to drink snake venom as long as there are no lacerations inside the mouth or digestive tract . There are however two exceptions : the Rhabdophis snakes ( keelback snakes ) secrete poison from glands that it gets from the poisonous toads that it preys on ; similarly certain garter snakes from Oregon retain toxins in their liver from the newts they eat . Over 600 species are known to be venomousâ '' about a quarter of all snake species . The following table lists some major species .

Silver ( I ) fluoride ( AgF ) , also known as argentous fluoride and silver monofluoride , is a compound of silver and fluorine . It is a ginger-coloured solid , melting point 435 Â C , which blackens on exposure to moist air . Unlike other silver halides such as silver chloride it is soluble in water to the extent of 1.8 kg\/L , and it even has some solubility in acetonitrile . AgF is made from silver ( I ) carbonate and hydrofluoric acid . Silver ( I ) fluoride finds most application in organofluorine chemistry for addition of fluoride across multiple bonds . For example , AgF adds to perfluoroalkenes in acetonitrile to give perfluoroalkylsilver ( I ) derivatives : RFCF = CF2 + AgF â ' RFCF ( CF3 ) Ag . Silver also forms a higher fluoride , silver ( II ) fluoride .
Samuel P. Taylor State Park is a state park located in Marin County , California . It contains approximately 2700 a of redwood and grassland . The park contains about 600 a of old-growth forest , some of which can be seen along the Pioneer Tree Trail . The park is named for Samuel Penfield Taylor , who found gold during the California Gold Rush and used some of his money to buy a parcel of land along Lagunitas Creek . In 1856 , Taylor built the Pioneer Paper Mill , the first paper mill on the Pacific Coast . In the 1870s , the North Pacific Coast Railroad was built between Cazadero and a pier in Sausalito where folks could catch a ferry to San Francisco . The railroad passed near Taylor 's mill , and , ever the entrepreneur , he built the `` Camp Taylor Resort '' alongside the tracks . A destination for city-weary San Franciscans , the resort offered both a hotel and tent camping , as well as swimming , boating , fishing , and a dance pavilion . Taylor died on January 22 , 1886 , and his family lost the mill and resort in the Panic of 1893 . However , a 1910 newspaper advertisement for the `` Camp Taylor Resort , '' touting its dance pavilion and on-site grocery and butcher , indicates that the resort continued to operate . The mill burned down in 1916 , and in 1945 the State of California took possession of the property for non-payment of taxes .
Rebellion , or uprising , is a refusal of obedience or order . It may , therefore , be seen as encompassing a range of behaviors from civil disobedience and mass nonviolent resistance , to violent and organized attempts to destroy an established authority such as a government . Those who participate in rebellions are known as `` rebels '' . A rebel is distinguished from an outsider . An outsider is one who is excluded from a group whereas a rebel goes against it . Also , a rebel 's potential to overthrow the leadership is recognized and substantial , unless the rebellion is crushed , whereas an outsider has been marginalized and is considered to be degenerate . Throughout history , many different groups that opposed their governments have been called rebels . Over 450 peasant revolts erupted in southwestern France between 1590 and 1715 . In the United States , the term was used for the Continentals by the British in the Revolutionary War , and for the Confederacy by the Union in the American Civil War . Most armed rebellions have not been against authority in general , but rather have sought to establish a new government in their place . For example , the Boxer Rebellion sought to implement a stronger government in China in place of the weak and divided government of the time . The Jacobite Risings ( called `` Jacobite Rebellions '' by the government ) attempted to restore the deposed Stuart kings to the thrones of England , Ireland and Scotland , rather than abolish the monarchy completely . A limited rebellion is an insurrection , and if the established government does not recognize the rebels as belligerents then they are insurgents and the revolt is an insurgency . In a larger conflict the rebels may be recognized as belligerents without their government being recognized by the established government , in which case the conflict becomes a civil war . There are a number of terms that fall under the umbrella of rebel and they range from those with positive connotations to those with pejorative connotations . Examples include :
One Piece is the first ever manga series to hold a `` Dome Tour , '' in which there will be events held in famous dome venues of Osaka and Tokyo in Spring 2011 . A style guide or style manual is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents , either for general use or for a specific publication , organization or field . The implementation of a style guide provides uniformity in style and formatting of a document . A set of standards for a specific organization is often known as `` house style '' . Style guides are common for general and specialized use , for the general reading and writing audience , and for students and scholars of various academic disciplines , medicine , journalism , the law , government , business , and industry . Organizations advocating for social minorities sometimes establish what they believe to be fair and correct language treatment of their audiences . Some style guides focus on graphic design , focusing on such topics as typography and white space . Web site style guides cover a publication 's visual and technical aspects , along with text . Many style guides are revised periodically to accommodate changes in conventions and usage . The Associated Press Stylebook , for example , is revised annually . Publishers ' style guides establish house rules for language use , such as spelling , italics and punctuation ; their major purpose is consistency . They are rulebooks for writers , ensuring consistent language . Authors are asked or required to use a style guide in preparing their work for publication ; copy editors are charged with enforcing the publishing house 's style . Academic organization and university style guides are rigorous about documentation formatting style for citations and bibliographies used for preparing term papers for course credit and manuscripts for publication . Professional scholars are advised to follow the style guides of organizations in their disciplines when they submit articles and books to academic journals and academic book publishers in those disciplines for consideration of publication . Once they have accepted work for publication , publishers provide authors with their own guidelines and specifications , which may differ from those required for submission , and editors may assist authors in preparing their work for press . Some organizations , other than those previously mentioned , produce style guides for either internal or external use . For example , communications and public relations departments of business and nonprofit organizations have style guides for their publications ( newsletters , news releases , web sites ) . Organizations advocating for social minorities sometimes establish what they believe to be fair and correct language treatment of their audiences . Many publications ( notably newspapers ) use graphic design style guides to demonstrate the preferred layout and formatting of a published page . They often are extremely detailed in specifying , for example , which fonts and colors to use . Such guides allow a large design team to produce visually consistent work for the organization . Several basic style guides for technical and scientific communication have been defined by international standards organizations . These are often used as elements of and refined in more specialized style guides that are specific to a subject , region or organization . One example is ISO 215 -- Presentation of contributions to periodicals & other serials . The European Union publishes an Interinstitutional Style Guideâ '' encompassing 23 languages across the European Union . This manual is `` obligatory '' for all those employed by the institutions of the EU who are involved in preparing EU documents and works . The Directorate-General for Translation of the European Commission publishes its own English Style Guide , intended primarily for English-language authors and translators , but aiming to serve a wider readership as well . In the United States , most non-journalistic professional writing follows The Chicago Manual of Style Scholarly writing may follow the MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing . A classic style guide for the general public is The Elements of Style .
Potassium arsenate is the chemical compound with the formula KH2AsO4 . Other salts are also called potassium arsenate , including K2HAsO4 and K3AsO4 . Each of these species is derived from arsenic acid : H3AsO4 + KOH â ' KH2AsO4 + H2O KH2AsO4 + KOH â ' K2HAsO4 + H2O K2HAsO4 + KOH â ' K3AsO4 + H2O These species are closely related to the corresponding potassium phosphates . The anions H2AsO4 , HAsO42 , and AsO43 feature tetrahedral AsO4 with two , one , or no H atoms attached to the oxygen atom ( s ) , respectively . Although this and related arsenic salts have been prescribed for health purposes , such compounds are highly toxic .
Saxe-Gotha was one of the Saxon duchies held by the Ernestine of the Wettin dynasty in the former Landgraviate of Thuringia . The ducal residence was erected at Gotha . It was established in 1640 , when Duke Wilhelm von Saxe-Weimar created a subdivision for his younger brother Ernest I the Pious . Duke Ernest took his residence at Gotha , where he had the Friedenstein Palace built between 1643 and 1654 . At the same time , the Duchy of Saxe-Eisenach was created for the third brother Albert IV . Nevertheless Albert died in 1644 , and Ernest inherited large parts of his duchy , though not the core territory around the residence at Eisenach and the Wartburg , which fell to his elder brother Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar . Ernest could also incorporate several remaining estates of the extinct House of Henneberg in 1660 , which had been vacant since 1583 . Finally in 1672 he received the major part of Saxe-Altenburg through his wife Elisabeth Sophie , after Altenburg 's last duke Frederick William III had died without heirs . Ernest would then be called Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg . When Ernest died in 1675 , he left his seven sons a significantly enlarged territory . The eldest , Frederick I at first ruled jointly with his brothers until in 1680 the duchy was divided . The area around Gotha and also Altenburg passed to Frederick I , who retained the title of a Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg . For later history of the duchy , see Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg . When the house of Saxe-Gotha and Altenburg became extinct in 1825 , Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg was split . Saxe-Gotha passed to the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld who in turn gave Saalfeld to Saxe-Meiningen . The Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen received Saxe-Altenburg , and gave the district of Hildburghausen to Saxe-Meiningen . After the abolition of German monarchies at the end of the First World War it became a part of the newly created state of Thuringia in 1920 .
In front of the construction there is a pond with carp , turtles , teal , herons , etc. , and offers a lake , an auditorium , a library , an expositions area , a theater , tennis courts and a cycle track . Samekh or Simketh is the fifteenth letter in many Semitic alphabets , including Phoenician , Hebrew , and Aramaic , representing \/ s \/ . The Arabic alphabet , however , uses a letter based on Phoenician Å in to represent \/ s \/ ( see there ) ; however , that glyph takes Samekh 's place in the traditional Abjadi order of the Arabic alphabet . The Phoenician letter gave rise to the Greek Xi ( Î , Î 3\/4 ) . . The origin of Samekh is unclear . The Phoenician letter may continue a glyph from the Middle Bronze Age alphabets , either based on a hieroglyph for a fish like Nun ( Ø Ù Ù samak is fish in Arabic ) , or a tent peg \/ some kind of prop ( s ` mikhah , , or t ` mikhah , , in modern Hebrew means to support ) , and thus may be derived from the Egyptian hieroglyph djed . R11 Samekh represents \/ s \/ , a voiceless alveolar fricative . Unlike most Semitic consonants , the pronunciation of \/ s \/ remains constant between vowels and before voiced consonants . Samekh in gematria has the value 60 . Samekh and Mem form the abbreviation for the Angel of Death , whose name in Hebrew is Samael . It also stands for centimetre . In some legends , samekh is said to have been a miracle of the Ten Commandments . records that the tablets `` were written on both their sides . '' The Jerusalem Talmud interprets this as meaning that the inscription went through the full thickness of the tablets . The stone in the center parts of the letters ayin and teth should have fallen out , as it was not connected to the rest of the tablet , but it miraculously remained in place . The Babylonian Talmud ( tractate Shabbat 104a ) , on the other hand , attributes this instead to samekh , but samekh did not have such a hollow form in the sacred Paleo-Hebrew alphabet that would presumably have been used for the tablets .
Mount Fure is a mountain in the Nasu Volcanic Zone . It is located in Chitose , HokkaidÅ , Japan . The mountain is the source of the Shiribetsu River .
Arsenic trichloride is an inorganic compound with the formula AsCl3 , also known as arsenous chloride or butter of arsenic . This poisonous oil is colourless , although impure samples may appear yellow . It is an intermediate in the manufacture of organoarsenic compounds . AsCl3 is a pyramidal molecule with C3v symmetry . The As-Cl bond is 2.161 Ã and the angle Cl-As-Cl is 98 Â 25 â Â 30 . AsCl3 has four normal modes of vibration : Î 1\/2 1 ( A1 ) 416 , Î 1\/2 2 ( A1 ) 192 , Î 1\/2 3 393 , and Î 1\/2 4 ( E ) 152 cmâ ' 1 . Arsenic trichloride contains predominantly covalent bonds , which explains its low melting point . It can also be prepared by chlorination of arsenic at 80-85 Â C , but this method requires elemental arsenic . 2 As + 3 Cl2 â ' 2 AsCl3 Arsenic trichloride can also be prepared by the reaction of arsenic oxide and sulfur monochloride . This method requires simple apparatus and proceeds efficiently : AsCl3 + 3 H2O â ' As ( OH ) 3 + 3 HCl Although AsCl3 is less moisture sensitive than PCl3 , it still fumes in moist air . AsCl3 undergoes redistribution upon treatment with As2O3 to give the inorganic polymer AsOCl . With chloride sources , AsCl3 , forms salts containing the anion ( AsCl4 ) â `` . Reaction with potassium bromide and potassium iodide give arsenic tribromide and arsenic triiodide , respectively . Arsenic compounds are highly toxic , and AsCl3 especially so because of its volatility and solubility .

Meguro is one of the 23 special wards of Tokyo , Japan . It calls itself Meguro District in English . Meguro hosts fifteen foreign embassies and consulates . One of Tokyo 's most exclusive residential neighborhoods ( Kakinokizaka ) is located in Meguro . As of December 31 , 2007 , the ward has an estimated population of 259,968 and a density of 17,685 persons per kmÂ . The total area is 14.70 kmÂ . The ward was founded on March 15 , 1947 . The Higashiyama shell mound contains remains from the paleolithic , JÅ mon , Yayoi , and Kofun periods . The area now known as Meguro was originally two towns , Meguro proper and Hibusuma , all parts of the former Ebara District of Musashi Province . The two were merged into a Meguro ward for Tokyo City in 1932 and since then the ward has remained with no alterations to its territory . Four other special wards surround Meguro . They are Shibuya ( to the northeast ) , Setagaya ( to the west ) , Å ta ( to the south ) and Shinagawa ( to the southeast ) . The current mayor is Aoki Eiji , an independent . Meguro has a city assembly with 36 elected members . Public elementary and junior high schools are operated by the Meguro City Board of Education . Public high schools are operated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education . In addition the metropolis operates a consolidated junior and senior high school called Ohsyukan Secondary Education School .
The British Rail Class 506 was a 3 carriage Electric Multiple Unit ( EMU ) built for local services between Manchester , Glossop and Hadfield on the Woodhead Line , which was electrified in 1954 . There were eight three-car units , ordered in 1938 and built in 1950 , but they did not enter service until June 1954 . Similar in design to the Class 306 EMUs ( prior to their conversion to 25 kV AC operation ) , and built on the same production lines ( making a total of 100 units of basically similar design ) , they were equipped with air-operated sliding doors . Each unit was formed of a Driving Motor Brake Third ( seating 52 ) ; a Trailer Composite ( seating 24 first class and 38 third class passengers ) ; and a Driving Trailer Third ( seating 60 ) . Third class was redesignated Second across the whole of BR on 3 June 1956 , whilst the first class seating of these units was declassified to second in early 1960 . The EMUs were equipped with a single diamond-shaped pantograph , mounted over the driver 's cab and adjacent guard 's compartment at the outer end of the driving motor carriage . This gave a ready identification feature , because ( following the withdrawal of the Manchester-Altrincham units in May 1971 ) , all other overhead-line EMUs operating in the Manchester area had the motor coach ( and thus the pantograph ) in the middle of the unit . Unlike class 306 , the eight class 506s remained solely equipped for 1500V DC operation for their entire lives . This made them unable to operate on any lines other than the Woodhead route â '' although they rarely operated east of Hadfield due to low gearing and the risk of overheating . The eight 3-car sets were formed into 6-car trains at peak hours . The frequency of the Glossop\/Hadfield service at peak times was every 30 minutes , and the round trip took nearly 90 minutes , requiring six of the eight units in service each weekday . With one spare unit , and one away for works overhaul at a time , there was no scope to use the units for other tasks . Being built against an LNER order , the numbers were in the former LNER series . To distinguish these from other similarly-numbered carriages , BR used letter prefixes and suffixes , but these varied . At the time that they were delivered , the numbers were in fact unique ; but from 1959 , new Diesel multiple-units were delivered carrying similar numbers , in the BR series . The Manchester-Glossop-Hadfield EMU number prefixes and suffixes may be summarised thus : The `` E '' suffix seems to have been dropped a few years prior to the change to `` M '' ; photographs exist from the 1964-1968 period showing unsuffixed numbers , including M59404 , M59405 and M59408 . No unit numbers were carried , however the cars were normally formed so that the last two digits corresponded , ie 59401-59501-59601 etc. , and the units were known locally as 01 , 02 , etc. . On the few occasions that units were reformed , one car would be renumbered to correspond with the others in its new unit ; thus 59406 became 59408 in December 1983 ( 59506 , 59606 and the real 59408 being withdrawn ) ; whilst 59401 ( crudely renumbered 59402 ) was formed with 59502 and 59602 about September 1984 ( 59501 , 59601 and the real 59402 being stored out of service ) . There is a suggestion that the motor coaches would originally have been numbered 29401-8 , but this may be a typo - the initial digit `` 2 '' would imply the North Eastern Area of the former LNER , whilst `` 5 '' denotes the Great Central Section . Originally , no special class code was allotted , the units being known as `` Manchester-Glossop-Hadfield '' stock . The class were officially numbered 506 under the TOPS system , however they never carried 506xxx numbers in service . The individual coach types were in the Eastern Region carriage diagram book as Dia . 363F ( Driving Motor ) , 366 ( Trailer ) and 365F ( Driving Trailer ) . Under TOPS , design codes EB2 .05.0 A , EH2 .04.0 A and EE2 .04.0 A respectively were allotted . In 1981 the Woodhead line was closed east of Hadfield . In December 1984 the remaining section was converted to the standard 25 kV AC overhead system and the Class 506 EMUs were withdrawn following the last run on 7 December . Following withdrawal , unit 59404-59504-59604 was set aside for preservation , but the rest were all sent to Vic Berry in Leicester for scrap , being cut up in April 1985 . They were replaced by Class 303s transferred from Glasgow ( themselves since withdrawn ) . The Manchester-Hadfield line is now operated by Class 323 EMUs . Whilst one complete unit was scheduled for preservation by West Yorkshire Transport Museum - being originally based at Dinting Railway Museum , then moved to the former BR depot at Bradford ( Hammerton Street ) , and finally to Butterley - it deteriorated severely ; two cars , and most of the third , were scrapped in August 1995 by Booth , Rotherham . All that remains is a severed driving end of a motor open brake second , M59404 , which is preserved at the Barrow Hill Roundhouse .
Oregon-grape ( Mahonia aquifolium , Berberidaceae ) is an evergreen shrub related to the barberry . Some authors place Mahonia in the barberry genus , Berberis . The Oregon-grape is not related to true grapes , but gets its name from the purple clusters of berries whose color and slightly dusted appearance is reminiscent of grapes . The name is often left un-hyphenated as Oregon grape , though doing so invites confusion with the true grapes . It also occasionally appears in print as Oregongrape . It is sometimes called Tall Oregon-grape to distinguish it from Creeping Oregon-grape ( M. repens ) and `` Cascade '' or Dwarf Oregon-grape ( M. nervosa ) . The botanic name aquifolium means that the leaf is holly-like ( from the Roman name for holly , aquifolium , ` prickly leaved ' ) . The plant grows to 1 â tall . Its leathery leaves resemble holly and the stems and twigs have a thickened , corky appearance . The flowers , borne in late spring , are yellow . Oregon-grape is used in gardens and natural landscaping similarly to barberry , as a plant suited for low-maintenance plantings and loose hedges . Oregon-grape is resistant to summer drought , tolerates poor soils , and does not create excessive leaf litter . Its berries attract birds . The small purplish-black fruits , which are quite tart and contain large seeds , are included in smaller quantities in the traditional diets of Pacific Northwest aboriginal peoples , mixed with Salal or another sweeter fruit . Today they are sometimes used to make jelly , alone or mixed with salal . Oregon grape juice can be fermented to make wine , similar to European barberry wine folk traditions , although it requires an unusually high amount of sugar . The inner bark of the larger stems and roots of Oregon-grape yield a yellow dye ; the berries give purple dye . As the leaves of Oregon-grape are holly-like and resist wilting , the foliage is sometimes used by florists for greenery and a small gathering industry has been established in the Pacific Northwest . Mahonia aquifolium is a native plant on the North American west coast from British Columbia to northern California , occurring in the understory of Douglas-fir forests and in brushlands . It is the state flower of Oregon . In some areas outside its native range , Oregon-grape has been classified as an invasive exotic species that may displace native vegetation . Some Plateau Indian tribes used Oregon-grape to treat dyspepsia . The plant is used medicinally by herbalists . Oregon-grape root is commonly used medicinally as an effective alternative to the threatened goldenseal . Both plants similarly contain the alkaloid berberine , known as an anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial used in the treatment of infection . Mahonia aquifolium is also known to be capable of treatment on inflammatory skin diseases such as Eczema and Psoriasis . Other actions may include alterative , diuretic , laxative and tonic . Recent studies indicate that M. aquifolium contains a specific multidrug resistance pump inhibitor ( MDR Inhibitor ) named 5 ` methoxyhydnocarpin ( 5 ` MHC ) which works to decrease bacterial resistance to antibiotics and antibacterial agents .

Leisure , or free time , is time spent away from business , work , and domestic chores . It is also the periods of time before or after necessary activities such as eating , sleeping and , where it is compulsory , education . The distinction between leisure and unavoidable activities is loosely applied , i.e. people sometimes do work-oriented tasks for pleasure as well as for long-term utility . A distinction may also be drawn between free time and leisure . For example , Situationist International maintains that free time is illusory and rarely free ; economic and social forces appropriate free time from the individual and sell it back to them as the commodity known as `` leisure '' . Leisure studies is the academic discipline concerned with the study and analysis of leisure . Time for leisure varies from one society to the next , although anthropologists have found that hunter-gatherers tend to have significantly more leisure time than people in more complex societies . As a result , band societies such as the Shoshone of the Great Basin came across as extraordinarily lazy to European colonialists . Workaholics are those who work compulsively at the expense of other activities . They prefer to work rather than spend time socializing and engaging in other leisure activities .

For the 2009 tsunami , see the main article : 2009 Samoa tsunami . Niuatoputapu is an island in the island nation of Tonga , Pacific Ocean . Its name means sacred island . Older European names for the island are Traitors island or Keppel island . Niuatoputapu is located in the north of the country , 300 km away from Vavau near the border with SÄ moa . Its closest neighbors are the small island of Tafahi , only 9 kilometers to the north-northeast , and the island of Niuafo ` ou . The three islands together form the administrative division of the Niuas . There is an airport in Niuatoputapu , Mataaho airport , which is designated to accept international flights . The population of Niuatoputapu was 934 in 2006 . The inhabitants formerly spoke the Niuatoputapu language , but it has now been extinct for centuries . Now the inhabitants speak Tongan . Nevertheless SÄ moan , Uvean and Futunan elements can be noticed . The central top of Niuatoputapu , just beside Vaipoa , is a hill of only 157 meters in height . It is the eroded remnant of a large volcano , which erupted about 3 million years ago . The island is surrounded by a large reef , uplifted and largely covered with volcanic ash , which has yielded it a fertile soil . Niuatoputapu consists primarily of three villages : Hihifo ( meaning `` west '' in Tongan ) , Vaipoa , and Falehau . Hihifo is the largest village , and , as its name suggests , lies in the west of the island . It contains the majority of the governmental facilities of the island , including the post office , telecommunications , police station and a high school ( there are primary schools in all 3 villages ) . Vaipoa lies in the middle of the island . To the east is Falehau , which contains Niuatoputapu 's port . The traditional line of lords of the island is the MÄ atu dynasty . According to the legends , an early member of them became the fish god Seketoa . Niuatoputapu was put on the European maps by Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire during their famous circumnavigation of the globe in their ship the Eendracht ( Unity ) in 1616 . After successful bartering with the inhabitants of Tafahi , but not finding a suitable anchorage there , they proceeded to its neighbor . There their reception was less peaceful . Natives boarded their ship and attacked the Dutch with clubs , until they found out what muskets were and could do . After that an uneasy truce existed , enabling the barter of more coconuts , ubes roots ( probably ufi ( yam ) ) , hogs and water . A ` king ' of the island came along , but not on board . `` He was equally naked with all the rest '' , only distinguishable by the respect the islanders paid to him . The next day the Dutch felt that something was in the air , and indeed when the king came again along he suddenly ordered his people into an attack . There were about 700 to 800 of them in 23 double canoes and 45 single canoes . But the Dutch fired their muskets and 3 canons , and the islanders then quickly made themselves scarce . Schouten and LeMaire continued their westwards trip , leaving Verraders ( Traitors ) island behind . The 2001 film The Other Side of Heaven , depicts the LDS missionary efforts of John Groberg on Niuatoputapu . The film was , however , filmed on Rarotonga in the Cook Islands and in Auckland , New Zealand as well . The island of Niuatoputapu was affected by a tsunami following a 2009 Samoa earthquake of an 8.0 Mw earthquake in the Samoan Islands region at 06:48:11 local time on 29 September 2009 ( 17:48:11 UTC ) .

Misanthropy is generalized dislike , distrust , disgust , contempt or hatred of the human species or human nature . A misanthrope is someone who holds such views or feelings . The word 's origin is from Greek words Î 1\/4 á -- Ï Î Ï ( misos , `` hatred '' ) and á 1\/4 Î 1\/2 Î Ï Ï Ï Î Ï ( anthrÅ pos , `` man , human being '' ) . Misanthropy has been ascribed to a number of writers of satire , such as William S. Gilbert ( `` I hate my fellow-man '' ) , but such identifications must be closely scrutinized because a critical or darkly humorous outlook toward mankind may be mistaken for genuine misanthropy . Jonathan Swift is widely accused of misanthropy ( see A Tale of a Tub and , most especially , Book IV of Gulliver 's Travels ) . In Western philosophy , misanthropy has been connected to isolation from human society . In Plato 's Phaedo , Socrates defines the misanthrope in relation to his fellow man : `` Misanthropy develops when without art one puts complete trust in somebody thinking the man absolutely true and sound and reliable and then a little later discovers him to be bad and unreliable ... and when it happens to someone often ... he ends up ... hating everyone . '' Misanthropy , then , is presented as the result of thwarted expectations or even excess optimism , since Plato argues that `` art '' would have allowed the potential misanthrope to recognize that the majority of men are to be found in between good and evil . Aristotle follows a more ontological route : the misanthrope , as an essentially solitary man , is not a man at all : he must be a beast or a god , a view reflected in the Renaissance of misanthropy as a `` beast-like state . '' It is important to distinguish between philosophical pessimism and misanthropy . Immanuel Kant said that `` Of the crooked timber of humanity , no straight thing can ever be made , '' and yet this was not an expression of the uselessness of mankind itself . Kant further stated that hatred of mankind can take two distinctive forms , aversion from men ( Anthropophobia ) or enmity towards them . The condition can arise partly from dislike and partly from ill-will . Another example of mistaken misanthropy is Jean-Paul Sartre 's quote `` Hell is other people . '' On the face of it , this looks deeply misanthropic , but actually Sartre was making an observation about the tendency of human beings to lack self-knowledge . We tend to project our worst fears , and our most deeply disliked personal characteristics , onto other people , rather than look inside and face them within ourselves . Thus , when we look at other people we often see the worst of what is in our own personality . The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer , on the other hand , was almost certainly as famously misanthropic as his reputation . He wrote that `` human existence must be a kind of error . '' It should be added , however , that misanthropy does not necessarily equate with an inhumane attitude towards humanity . Schopenhauer concluded , in fact , that ethical treatment of others was the best attitude , for we are all fellow sufferers and all part of the same will-to-live ; he also discussed suicide with a sympathetic understanding which was rare in his own time , when it was largely a taboo subject . More specifically , Schopenhauer has also been accused of misogyny . Martin Heidegger also showed misanthropy in his concern of the `` they '' â '' the tendency of people to conform to one view , which no-one has really thought through , but is just followed because , `` they say so '' . Unlike Schopenhauer , Heidegger was opposed to any ethics or reason to treat others with respect . Though rare , misanthropy has appeared in forms of popular entertainment . Deep ecology , as upheld by thinkers such as Pentti Linkola and Earth First ! founder David Foreman , has been criticized as being misanthropical by Murray Bookchin . Detestation of people , humanity in general may be a reaction to social orders perceived as barbaric , repressive , unfair , or hyper-competitive . In his 1949 article Why Socialism ? Einstein gives the example of a cultured man who states that the destruction of humanity would not be a bad thing . Serial killers and other sociopaths frequently express misanthropic attitudes . Serial murderer Carl Panzram was remembered for his violent and indiscriminate misanthropy , with his last words before being hanged recorded as `` I wish all mankind had one neck so I could choke it ! '' . In early and pre-Islamic philosophy , certain thinkers such as Ibn al-Rawandi , a skeptic of Islam , and Muhammad ibn Zakariya ar-Razi often expressed misanthropic views . In the Judeo-Islamic philosophies ( 800 â `` 1400 ) , the Jewish philosopher Saadia Gaon , uses the Platonic idea that the self-isolated man is dehumanized by friendlessness to argue against the misanthropy of anchorite asceticism and reclusiveness .
Hiromasa Suguri ( born 29 July 1976 ) is a former Japanese football player .
Lars Ricken ( born 10 July 1976 in Dortmund ) is a retired German footballer . The skilled midfielder represented Borussia Dortmund during his entire professional career , which spanned 15 years . He was the youngest player to ever appear for Borussia in an official match , a record later broken by Nuri Å ahin . Ricken joined BV Borussia Dortmund at an early age , and made his senior debut on 8 March 1994 ( not yet 18 ) , in a 1 â `` 2 home defeat against VfB Stuttgart . From the following season onwards , he became a regular , scoring a memorable long distance goal in the 1997 UEFA Champions League Final against Juventus FC . That goal made Ricken the youngest goalscorer and scorer of the fastest goal in a Champions League final , finding the net after just 16 seconds on the field as a substitute . He also combined for 47 matches and eight goals in the side 's back-to-back national titles ( 1994 â `` 96 ) . In the following years , Ricken 's success was tampered by a series of injuries . An international since 10 September 1997 , in a 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Armenia , he missed that major international tournament , as well as UEFA Euro 2000 . Later , he restored his form , helping Dortmund to claim the league title in 2002 , scoring a career-best six goals , and being selected by national coach Rudi VÃ ller for the German squad at that year 's World Cup . Ricken did not play in the tournament , as Germany emerged runners-up . Ricken 's injury woes returned after the World Cup and , as a consequence , he failed to earn recognition at both European or international level . In early April 2007 , he was demoted to the reserve team by then Dortmund coach Thomas Doll , due to substandard performance . On November , Ricken announced to retire from football . In an attempt to return to football , he briefly attended a training camp in February 2008 with the Columbus Crew of the Major League Soccer , but returned to Germany and Dortmund in a few days . On 11 June 2008 , Borussia Dortmund sport director Michael Zorc , also a former club footballer , announced that Ricken was to be hired as youth coordinator , with immediate effect , while still appearing for the club 's amateur side , in Regionalliga West . However , on 16 February 2009 , he announced his retirement from professional football .
The Opel Agila is a city car built from 2000 onwards . It is a badge-engineered version of the Suzuki Wagon R and Suzuki Splash manufactured by Magyar Suzuki and sold by German automaker Opel . It is badged as a Vauxhall in the United Kingdom . The first-generation Agila was a rebadged version of the Suzuki Wagon R + , which was produced in Japan . The Agila 's Opel-sourced 1.0 and 1.2-litre petrol engines were smaller than the European-market 1.3-litre found in the European-market Wagon R + , but were more powerful and refined . Equipment levels , low asking prices and running costs also contributed towards the Agila 's success . The Agila was built at Opel 's factory in Gliwice , Poland . The Suzuki Wagon R + was built at the Suzuki plant in Esztergom , Hungary until 2004 , and since January 2005 has also been built in Poland . While many city cars such as the Ford Ka , Volkswagen Lupo and Fiat Nuova 500 come with just three doors , the Agila came with five . It was as tall as Korean city cars such as the Hyundai Atos and Kia Picanto . The high roof-line and boxy image suited Japanese tastes of getting the most from a car of the smallest size . This however seriously affects the handling and ride of the car . If taken into a corner too quickly , it has serious amounts of body roll and wobbles side to side when driven next to large trucks or in cross-winds . But the car was not made for the circuit or motorways , but for city use , like Tokyo . The vehicle is ideal for the budget family motorist or for transporting tall people . The second-generation Agila was officially announced on May 15 , 2007 , and was presented at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show . Suzuki sells this model as the Splash . The car is 200 m longer than its predecessor , that is bigger than traditional city cars and similar to small superminis and mini MPVs like the Citroen C3 Picasso , Toyota Yaris , Honda Jazz and Nissan Micra . Petrol engines are a three cylinder 1.0-litre , 65 P and a four cylinder 1.2-litre 86 P , and the diesel unit a four cylinder 1.3-litre 75 P with common rail technology . The Agila comes in two different trim levels : Base\/Essentia and Edition\/Enjoy .

Tongeren is a city and municipality located in the province of Limburg , Flemish region , Belgium . Tongeren is the oldest town in Belgium being founded in 15 BC . Inhabited in the Roman period by the Tungri , and known as Atuatuca Tungrorum , it was the administrative center of the district under Roman rule . Before the Roman conquests , this area was inhabited by the Atuatuci , part of the Belgic confederacy . During Julius Caesarâ s campaigns in this area in the 1st century BC , the Belgae united against Caesar . The Atuatuci were too late for the general Belgic muster and defeat by Caesar ; they retreated to their town where the Romans besieged them . They decided to surrender and gave up most of their weapons , but next day sortied against the Roman troops , who defeated them . The day after , the Romans broke down the undefended gates and sold the entire tribe of the Atuatuci into slavery . The Tungri , a coalition of Belgic tribes , took their place . The town grew into a sizeable settlement known as Atuatuca Tungrorum . Located on the important road linking Cologne to Bavay via the relay of Liberchies , and surrounded by the fertile lands of the Hesbaye region , the settlement quickly became one of the largest Gallo-Roman administrative and military towns in the 1st century . Atuatuca Tungrorum suffered from a destructive fire during the Batavian siege in 70CE . In the 2nd century , it erected a defensive wall , portions of which can still be seen today . Typical Roman buildings were built in town , while villas and graves ( tumuli ) dotted the surrounding area . In the 4th century , the city became the center of a Christian diocese -- one of the earliest in the Low Countries -- under the influence of Saint Servatius , bishop of Tongeren , later also bishop of Maastricht , who died in 384CE . It may have been destroyed by the Huns in 451CE . The Merovingian period between the 5th and the 8th century is not well documented . The building of a new church and the foundation of a chapter of canons took place in Carolingian times , at the very place where the old bishopsâ houses stood , and where the basilica still stands today . The construction of the current basilica started at the beginning of the 13th century in the prevalent Gothic style of that period . Other buildings were added to the religious core of the city , including new commercial areas , hospitals and artisans quarters . The 13th century also saw the building of the medieval defensive wall , several new churches and cloisters , and the beguinage . The city became one of the â bonnes villesâ ( or principal cities ) of the Prince-Bishopric of LiÃ ge . In 1677 , the city was burned almost entirely by Louis XIVâ s troops , a catastrophe from which Tongeren never completely recovered . The rebirth of the city dates from after 1830 . Tongeren is currently the judicial capital of the Limburg province . ( ( File : Tongeren Innenstadt . jpg thumb right PÃ mpkÃ `` skal ( Pump-chat , pÃ mpkÃ `` = pump ( diminutive ) , kal = chat ) .

Perchloric acid is the inorganic compound with the formula HClO4 . Usually encountered as an aqueous solution , this colourless compound is a strong acid comparable in strength to sulfuric and nitric acids , as well as a powerful oxidizing agent . It is useful for preparing perchlorate salts , especially ammonium perchlorate , an important rocket fuel . Perchloric acid is also dangerously corrosive and readily forms explosive mixtures . Perchloric acid is produced industrially by two routes . The traditional method exploits the very high aqueous solubility of sodium perchlorate ( 209 g\/100 mL of water at room temperature ) . Treatment of such solutions with hydrochloric acid gives perchloric acid , precipitating solid sodium chloride : NaClO4 + HCl â ' NaCl + HClO4 The concentrated acid can be purified by distillation . The alternative route , which is more direct and involves no salts , entails anodic oxidation of aqueous chlorine at a platinum electrode . Treatment of barium perchlorate with sulfuric acid precipitates barium sulfate , leaving perchloric acid . It also can be made by mixing nitric acid with ammonium perchlorate . The reaction gives nitrous oxide and perchloric acid due to a concurrent reaction involving the ammonium ion . Anhydrous perchloric acid is an oily liquid at room temperature . It forms at least five hydrates , several of which have been characterized crystallographically . These solids consist of the perchlorate anion linked via hydrogen bonds to H2O and H3O + centers Perchloric acid forms an azeotrope with water , consisting of about 72.5 % perchloric acid . This form of the acid is stable indefinitely and is commercially available . Such solutions are hygroscopic . Thus , if left open to the air , concentrated perchloric acid dilutes itself by absorbing water from the air . Perchloric acid is mainly produced as a precursor to ammonium perchlorate , which is used as rocket fuel . The growth in rocketry has led to increased production of perchloric acid . Several million kilograms are produced annually . Perchloric acid , a superacid , is one of the strongest BrÃ nsted-Lowry acids . Its pKa is â ' 10 . It provides strong acidity without interference from potential nucleophiles such as sulfate or chloride that complicate the use of sulfuric and hydrochloric acids . Other acids of noncoordinating anions , such as fluoroboric acid and hexafluorophosphoric acid are susceptible to hydrolysis , whereas perchloric acid is not . Despite hazards associated with the explosiveness of its salts , the acid is often preferred in certain syntheses . For similar reasons , it is a useful eluent in ion-exchange chromatography . It is also used for electropolishing\/etching of aluminum , molybdenum , and other metals . Anhydrous and monohydrated perchloric acid are explosive , but the usual aqueous solutions are stable in the absence of organic compounds . It is very corrosive to skin and eyes . Upon contact with concentrated perchloric acid , organic materials such as cloth and wood ignite . Salts of perchloric acid are also powerful oxidizers that can be explosive . Perchlorate salts tend to be more stable than their chlorate counterparts , which has led to their increased use in pyrotechnic compositions due to safety concerns . Because of these hazards , perchloric acid is usually handled under fume hoods with wash-down and air scrubbing capabilities , which are not available on standard laboratory fume hoods . The crystalline form of the acid , which is explosive and shock sensitive , can precipitate on hood surfaces ; washing down the hood interior solves this problem . On February 20 , 1947 , in Los Angeles California , 17 people were killed and 150 injured when a bath , consisting of over 1000 litres of 75 % perchloric acid and 25 % acetic anhydride by volume , exploded . The plant , 25 other buildings and 40 automobiles were obliterated and 250 nearby homes were damaged . The bath was being used to electro-polish aluminum furniture , and despite knowing the explosive dangers of the bath , the plant chemist , Robert M. McGee , allowed production to continue after the refrigeration system , to keep the batch cool , failed . In addition , organic compounds were added to the overheating bath when an iron rack was replaced with one coated with cellulose acetobutyrate ( Tenit-2 plastic ) . A few minutes later the bath exploded .
Bryan Adams was the self-titled debut solo album by Canadian rock singer Bryan Adams released in February 1980 on A&M Records . While the album did not gain attention in the US , `` Hidin ' From Love '' reached # 64 and `` Give Me Your Love '' reached # 91 both on Canada 's RPM 100 Singles chart . In early 1978 , Bryan Adams teamed up with Jim Vallance ( formerly of Canadian band Prism ) to form a song-writing duo . A&M signed the pair as songwriters and A&M signed him as an artist shortly afterwards . He worked on his debut album for the balance of 1979 with it being released in February 1980 . The first single was `` Hidin ' from Love '' in 1980 ( # 43 on the Billboard dance charts ) which was followed up by `` Give Me Your Love '' and `` Remember '' . Although the album never received any US notoriety on its debut , it was the door opener that led to getting radio play , tours , management , agents and the music business in general , interested in the 20 year old songwriter . The first tour was across Canada playing clubs and colleges . It was during this time that Adams developed the songs for the US breakthrough album You Want It You Got It ( 1981 ) .
Burst kinetics is a form of enzyme kinetics that refers to an initial high velocity of enzymatic turnover when adding enzyme to substrate . This initial period of high velocity product formation is referred to as the `` Burst Phase '' . This period is observed as the enzymes become saturated with substrate up until all enzymes are saturated . Once all enzymes are saturated , the Burst Phase gives way to a linear reaction velocity . An example of a burst kinetics is observed in Step 6 of Glycolysis involving GAP Dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) and the reduction of NAD + to NADH . Furthermore , the production of NADH can be measured as it is yellow and absorbs at 340 nm .

Noodle soup refers to a variety of soups with noodles and other ingredients served in a light broth . Noodle soup is an East and Southeast Asian staple . Less well known , a form of fresh ( typically home made ) noodle is used in soup in certain parts of Europe ( see SpÃ tzle ) , and in northern China ; usually , it is served for breakfast or brunch . The type of noodles range from rice noodles to egg noodles . There are a myriad of noodle soup dishes originating in China , and many of these are eaten in , or adapted in various Asian countries . Philippine noodle soups can be seen served in street stalls , as well as in the home . They show a distinct blend of Oriental and Western culture adjusted to suit the Philippine palate . They are normally served with condiments such as patis , soy sauce , calamansi juice , as well as pepper to further adjust the flavor . Like other types of soup , they may be regarded as comfort food and are regularly associated with the cold , rainy season in the Philippines . They are normally eaten with a pair of spoon and fork , alternating between scooping the soup , and handling the noodles , and are less commonly eaten with the combination of chopsticks and a soup spoon . Thai noodle soups are popular in street stalls , canteens and food courts . The noodles are served in a light ( chicken ) stock , often topped with meat or fish balls and coriander leaves . The diner then adjusts the flavor by themselves using sugar , nam pla ( fish sauce ) , dried chilli and chilli in vinegar provided at the table . Unlike most other Thai food , noodles are eaten with chopsticks .
Bernhard `` Berni '' Klodt ( 26 October 1926 -- 23 May 1996 ) was a German football player . He was born in Gelsenkirchen-Bismarck ; the goalkeeper Hans Klodt was his brother . Between 1950 and 1959 , he played 19 times and scored three goals for the Germany national football team . He was part of the 1954 FIFA World Cup-winning squad , and also played in the 1958 FIFA World Cup . For his club career , he played for FC Schalke 04 . He died in Garmisch-Partenkirchen . He debuted in the senior team on 14 March 1943 at the age of 16 , when FC Schalke 04 beat VfL Bochum by 10 â `` 1 . During the 1954 World Cup , Klodt had started in the outside right position instead of Helmut Rahn . He played in both games against Turkey . Although he played fairly well in both games , Sepp Herberger decided to replace him with Rahn for the quarterfinal against Yugoslavia . Herberger 's decision at first was not exclusively greeted with enthusiasm by the press , but after Rahn had scored against Yugoslavia , Klodt was out of the team for good . The basis for Herberger 's decision was his hope that Rahn with his unconventional style and shooting prowess was more likely to turn around a game than any other player . Contrary to Rahn , Klodt was said to be less of an individualist and more of a teamplayer . Aged 36 , Klodt ended his career in 1963 with the start of the Bundesliga . In his last game , he scored the only goal in Schalke 's 1 â `` 0 victory against the Bulgarian national team on 18 June 1963 . Klodt had played in 330 Oberliga games in which he scored 131 goals . After his retirement from football , Klodt among other things coached the youth team of FC Schalke 04 and also worked as salesman for a brewery . After suffering a heart attack and a stroke in 1990 , he was paralysed from the right .

Alvin `` Moose '' Wistert ( June 26 , 1916 -- October 3 , 2005 ) was an American football player . He played college football for the University of Michigan Wolverines . He was the last of the three Wistert brothers ( Francis , Albert ( Al ) ) who were named All-American tackles at Michigan and later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame . He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1981 . The World War II Marine Corps veteran was the oldest college football player ever selected as an All-American at age 33 . He and his brothers are three of the seven players who have had their numbers retired by the Michigan Wolverines football program . After dropping out from Schurz High School , Wistert had to pass a series of tests similar to the modern day General Educational Development tests . Wistert used the World War II G.I. Bill to attend college . He lettered as a 30 year old freshman at Boston University before transferring to the University of Michigan . He was the last of the Wistert brothers to play for the Wolverines where he , like his brothers before him , wore number 11 , which has since been retired by the University of Michigan , he played there from 1947-1949 . He was a consensus All-American in both 1948 and 1949 . He was team captain in 1949 . He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1981 as the third Wistert Brother so honored . In 1981 , he was named to the University of Michigan Hall of Honor in the fourth class of inductees alongside his brothers . Only five Michigan football players earned this honor before him . The 1947 , 1948 , and 1949 teams were all Big Ten Conference champions . Both the 1947 team , Fritz Crisler 's last team , and 1948 team were undefeated and finished the season ranked number 1 in the Associated Press polls . The 1947 team , referred to as `` The Mad Magicians '' , is widely considered to be the greatest University of Michigan football team of all time . In the 1948 Rose Bowl the team tied the record for the most points scored in a Rose Bowl game , beating the USC Trojans 49-0 . ( 1902 Rose Bowl , Michigan def . Stanford University 49 - 0 ) Wistert was from a Lithuanian family . His father was a Spanish-American War veteran who was later killed in the line of duty while working for the Chicago Police Department . Wistert had not played football in high school before dropping out . He had been a salesman until World War II and then served in the Marine Corps . After football , he worked in the insurance business and later worked in manufacturing . Wistert had two daughters and four grandchildren . His only grandson , Jason Alvin Neeser , played basketball at Dartmouth College .
Perdita is an inner satellite of Uranus . Perdita 's discovery was complicated . The first photographs of Perdita were taken by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986 , but it was not recognized from the photographs for more than a decade . In 1999 , the moon was noticed by Erich Karkoschka and reported . But because no further pictures could be taken to confirm its existence , it was officially demoted in 2001 . However , in 2003 , pictures taken by the Hubble Space Telescope managed to pick up an object where Perdita was supposed to be , finally confirming its existence . Following its discovery in 1999 , it was given the temporary designation of S\/1986 U 10 . It was named Perdita ( Latin for ` lost ' ) after the daughter of Leontes and Hermione in William Shakespeare 's play The Winter 's Tale . The moon is also designated Uranus XXV . The moon orbits between Belinda and Puck . The abovementioned Hubble measurements prove that Perdita does not follow a direct Keplerian motion around Uranus . Instead , it is clearly caught in a 43:44 orbital resonance with the nearby moon Belinda . It is also close to an 8:7 resonance with Rosalind . Perdita belongs to Portia Group of satellites , which also includes Bianca , Cressida , Desdemona , Portia , Juliet , Cupid , Rosalind and Belinda . These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties . Little is known about Perdita apart from its orbit , radius of 15 km and geometric albedo of 0.08 .

The per capita income for the city was $ 15,653 . About 9.5 % of families and 11.3 % of the population were below the poverty line , including 11.5 % of those under age 18 and 14.0 % of those age 65 or over . In 1961 , Flora was named `` Ford Town USA '' and some 1500 vehicle owners were supplied with a new Ford car or truck . Flora 's main industry is agriculture , although there are companies located in Flora that employ several hundreds . Flora is surrounded by a gently rolling countryside , with approximately 80-85 % of it dedicated to farming and livestock . Current DCCA profile information is available on the City of Flora 's website http://florail.us/dcca1.htm In 1987 a group of Flora officials formed the Barbed Wire Choir and recorded a music video in an attempt to land a state prison . The song featured several city officials , including the mayor , asking then-Gov . Jim Thompson `` Is we is or is we is n't \/ gonna get ourselves a prison . '' After initially being shown on local TV stations , the video was soon picked up by national stations such as WGN , MTV and ABC 's `` Good Morning America . '' Mayor Charles Overstreet appeared on the `` The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers , '' and weatherman Spencer Christian later visited the town . After the hoopla died down , Flora lost their bid to three other communities . It also appeared briefly on Oprah at one point .
1901 ( MCMI ) was a common year starting on Tuesday ( link will display calendar ) of the Gregorian calendar and a common year starting on Monday of the 13-day-slower Julian calendar . It was also the first year of the 20th century . The date of Fri December 13 20:45:52 1901 is significant for modern computers because it is the earliest date representable with a signed 32-bit integer on systems that reference time in seconds since the Unix epoch . This corresponds to -2147483648 seconds from Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 1970 . For the same reason , many computer storage systems are also unable to represent an earlier date . For related reasons , many computer systems suffer from the Year 2038 problem . This is when the positive number of seconds since 1970 exceeds 2147483647 ( 01111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 in binary ) and wraps to -2147483648 . Hence the computer system erroneously displays or operates on the time Fri Dec 13 20:45:52 1901 . In this way the year 1900 is to the Year 2000 problem as is the year 1901 to the Year 2038 problem .
The calcareous sponges of class Calcarea are members of the animal phylum Porifera , the cellular sponges . They are characterized by spicules made out of calcium carbonate in the form of calcite or aragonite . While the spicules in most species have three points , in some species they have either two or four points . All sponges in this class are strictly marine , and , while they are distributed worldwide , most are found in shallow tropical waters . Like all other sponges , they are sedentary filter feeders . All three sponge body plans are represented within class Calcarea : asconoid , syconoid , and leuconoid . Typically , calcareous sponges are small , measuring less than 10 c in height , and drab in color . However , a few brightly colored species are also known . Calcareous sponges vary from radially symmetrical vase-shaped body types to colonies made up of a meshwork of thin tubes , or irregular massive forms . The skeleton has either a mesh or honeycomb structure . Of the 15,000 or so species of Porifera that exist , only 400 of those are Calcareans . Calcarean sponges first appeared during the Cambrian and their diversity was greatest during the Cretaceous period . Recent molecular analysis suggests that the class Calcarea should be designated as a phylum , in particular the first to have diverged in the Kingdom Animalia ; the other sponges belong to the phylum Silicarea .
Michael FrolÃ k ( ; born February 17 , 1988 ) is a Czech professional ice hockey player currently playing for the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . FrolÃ k played two seasons in the Czech Extraliga for Rabat Kladno before being selected tenth overall in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft by the Florida Panthers .

In 2004 , scientists announced that they had succeeded in carrying out the first acid-base reaction with a hassium compound : Roraima ( Tupi : Green Plateau ) is the northernmost and least populated state of Brazil , located in the Amazon region . It borders the states of Amazonas and ParÃ , as well as the nations of Venezuela and Guyana . The population is 400,000 ( 2006 ) and the capital is Boa Vista . Roraima is the Brazilian state with the fewest municipalities , 15 in total . The climate of Roraima is tropical with an annual mean temperature of 26 Â C ( 78.8 Â F ) . The state 's southern part is located in the Amazon rainforest , while the north has open grassland fields , and there is a small strip of savanna to the east . The state is rich in mineral deposits - especially gold , diamonds , cassiterite , bauxite , marble and copper . Many of these deposits are located in indigenous reserves , and illegal mining has resulted in frequent conflicts with the native population , especially the Yanomami and the Macuxi and allied groups . The Monte Roraima National Park is located around one of the highest mountains of both Venezuela ( outside of the Andes ) and Brazil , and the highest in Guyana , a 2,875 m ( 9,432 ft ) high tepui known as Monte Roraima . Only a small fraction of the mountain is in Brazilian territory , however , and the highest point of the Brazilian part is at 2,734 metres ( 8,970 ft ) . Except for the higher mountains where the climate is cooler but very wet , Roraima has an equatorial climate . This is a type of tropical climate in which there is no dry season â `` all months have mean precipitation values of at least 60 mm . It is usually found at latitudes within five degrees of the equator â `` which are dominated by the Intertropical Convergence Zone . The equatorial climate is denoted Af in the KÃ ppen climate classification . Tropical rainforest is the natural vegetation in equatorial regions . The Amazon represents over half of the planet 's remaining rainforests and comprises the largest and most species-rich tract of tropical rainforest in the world . Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich biome , and tropical forests in the Americas are consistently more species rich than the wet forests in Africa and Asia . As the largest tract of tropical rainforest in the Americas , the Amazonian rainforests have unparalleled biodiversity . More than 1\/3 of all species in the world live in the Amazon Rainforest . Since the beginnings of the 16th century , the region now considered the state of Roraima was disputed territory , because of its rich mineral reserves . It was sought by the Spanish , Portuguese , Dutch and English until the beginning of the last century . But in 1943 , together with a section from the state of Amazonas , the Federal Government created the territory of Rio Branco , which became Roraima in 1962 . In 1988 , Roraima became a state by decision of the National Congress . The name of the state was taken from Mount Roraima , whose name comes from the Pemon words â roroiâ ( â cyanâ ) and â maâ ( â largeâ ) . According to the IBGE of 2007 , there were 405,000 people residing in the state . The population density was 1.8 inh . \/ kmÂ . Urbanization : 80.3 % ( 2004 ) ; Population growth : 4.6 % ( 1991 â `` 2000 ) ; Houses : 97,465 ( 2005 ) . The last PNAD ( National Research for Sample of Domiciles ) census revealed the following numbers : 278,000 Brown ( Multiracial ) people ( 68.8 % ) , 81,000 White people ( 20.0 % ) , 29,000 Black people ( 7.4 % ) , 15,000 Asian or Amerindian people ( 3.8 % ) . The Brazilian Indian agency , ( FUNAI ) estimates the state 's indigenous population at 30,715 . The largest indigenous groups are the Macuxi ( 16,500 ) and the better-known Yanomami . ( 11,700 ) Much of the state 's indigenous population lives in several large , legally recognized indigenous reserves and a number of smaller ones , totalling 46.13 % of the land area of the state . The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 87.5 % , followed by the industrial sector at 8.7 % . Agriculture represents 3.8 % , of GDP ( 2004 ) . Roraima exports : wood 74 % , leather 22.6 % ( 2002 ) . Share of the Brazilian economy : 0.1 % ( 2005 ) . Portuguese is the official national language , and thus the primary language taught in schools . But English and Spanish are part of the official high school curriculum . Boa Vista International Airport was opened on February 19 , 1973 , and underwent its first big remodeling in 1998 . The passenger terminal , runway and apron were all enlarged , and a separate taxiway was built . The airport has the capacity to receive 675,000 passengers a year . The blue of the flag represents the pure air and the sky of Roraima , the white strip symbolizes peace , and the green to the right represents the forests and fields . The star - symbolizing the state in the national flag of Brazil - is yellow , which symbolizes the mineral resources of the state . The red line in bottom stands for the equator , which cuts through the state .
Operation Cornflakes was a World War II Office of Strategic Services PSYOP mission in 1944 and 1945 which involved tricking the German postal service Deutsche Reichspost into inadvertently delivering anti-Nazi propaganda to German citizens through mail . The operation involved special planes that were instructed to airdrop bags of false , but properly addressed , mail in the vicinity of bombed mail trains . When recovering the mail during clean-up of the wreck , the postal service would hopefully confuse the false mail for the real thing and deliver it to the various addresses . The content of the mail often included copies of Das Neue Deutschland , the Allies ' German language propaganda news sheet . The postage stamps used on the envelopes were forged 6-pf and 12-pf Hitler-head stamps intended to look identical to genuine German stamps of the era , though these forgeries were printed by the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) . In addition to these two forgeries , the OSS printed another design of the 12-pf stamp not-too-subtly redrawn so that Adolf Hitler 's face shows his partially exposed skull . Also , the country identifier ` Deutsches Reich ' ( German Empire ) read ` Futsches Reich ' ( lost , destroyed , or collapsed empire ) . Copies of this ` death head ' stamp were inserted in the envelopes along with other propaganda materials . The first mission of Operation Cornflakes took place on 5 January 1945 , when a mail train to Linz was bombed . Bags containing a total of about 3800 propaganda letters were then dropped at the site of the wreck , which were subsequently picked up and delivered to Germans by the postal service .

RÃ 1\/4 diger Abramczik ( born 18 February 1956 in Gelsenkirchen-Erle ) is a former German football player and coach , best known for his ability to cross the ball ( `` Flankengott '' ) . Abramczik , whose younger brother Volker later became also a professional footballer for Schalke 04 , joined the ranks of the city 's biggest club , FC Schalke 04 , from native SV Erle 08 at the age of ten after former German international Bernhard Klodt spotted him . Schalke 's former Bundesliga player Friedel Rausch was partly coaching him in the youth of Schalke then , getting impressed by his unique mobility and pace . It was Rausch who warmly recommended young Abi to Schalke 's manager Ivica Horvath , feeling the schoolboy international ( 23 caps ) could already do a job on the highest level . For the kick-off of the 1973 â `` 74 Bundesliga season , FC Schalke 04 traveled to VfB Stuttgart to see Horvath handing him a starting role . Schalke lost , with Stuttgart 's Hermann Ohlicher 's hat-trick the only goals in the game , but Abramczik 's appearance on that 11 August made him the youngest ever player used on Bundesliga level at that time . Making fourteen appearances in his Bundesliga debut season , he went on to become a key player for his club in less than three years , netting ten goals for Schalke in 1976 â `` 77 , when they finished runner-up behind Borussia MÃ nchengladbach . The yield of ten goals scored by the then 20-year-old Abramczik remained the best effort of a young Bundesliga player until Lukas Podolski hit ten for 1 . FC KÃ ln as an eighteen year old in 2003 â `` 04 . KÃ ln 's MÃ 1\/4 ngersdorfer Stadion witnessed RÃ 1\/4 diger Abramczik 's Germany debut when the side of Helmut SchÃ n beat Northern Ireland ( 5 â `` 0 ) on 27 April 1977 . Abramczik , who was forming a formidable striker duo with Klaus Fischer for Schalke at that time , was called up further by SchÃ n and with the 1978 FIFA World Cup at stage , Abramczik enjoyed his taking part in it for the defending champion . Tipped to be a delight for Germany , failing to produce greater consistency in his game appeared to be the bar to his further proceedings in Die Nationalmannschaft . His life as a German international lasted for only nineteen caps in between 1977 and 1979 , with a 3 â `` 1 win against Malta at Gzira his last international cap , an abrupt end furthered by a voiced conflict with then DFB president Hermann Neuberger . Joining FC Schalke 04 's bitter arch-rival Borussia Dortmund at the end of the 1979 â `` 80 season , Abramczik 's days in Dortmund lasted until he joined 1 . FC Nuremberg in 1983 . That worked out to be a disastrous career move for the Gelsenkirchen-born , his new club was relegated from Bundesliga with him getting suspended by the club for committing misconduct . He then showed up for Galatasaray Istanbul under Jupp Derwall and had a spell with Rot-Wei Ã Oberhausen in the 2nd Bundesliga before heading back to hometown club FC Schalke 04 in October 1987 . Coming to action in four further Bundesliga matches in the space of five weeks for them , a campaign in which Schalke was chanceless to avoid the drop to 2nd Bundesliga , Abramczik decided to retire from the professional game to go on playing on amateur level for Wormatia Worms and FC GÃ 1\/4 tersloh . RÃ 1\/4 diger Abramczik 's career in coaching was caused by his decision to work as assistant-manager of Peter Neururer at 1 . FC SaarbrÃ 1\/4 cken when he run a dyeworks shop in Gelsenkirchen . A year later , SaarbrÃ 1\/4 cken appointed him Neururer 's successor in 1992 . He managed Antalyaspor from 1999 to 2000 .

A French press , also known as a press pot , coffee press , coffee plunger , cafetiere ( UK ) or Ñ afetiÃ re Ã piston , is a simple coffee brewing device which was invented in France in the late 19th century . It was first patented by Italian designer Attilio Calimani in 1929 . The French press goes by various names around the world . In Italy the press is known as a `` Feurn de Leur '' , a French name . In New Zealand , Australia and South Africa the apparatus is known as a coffee plunger , and coffee brewed in it as plunger coffee . Its French name is cafetiÃ re Ã piston . In French , it is also known by its brand names , notably , Melior , from an old brand of this type . In the UK and the Netherlands the device is known as a cafetiÃ re ; the French word for a coffee maker or pot . The French press underwent several design modifications over the years . The first coffee press , which may have been made in France , was the modern coffee press in its most rudimentary form : a metal or cheesecloth screen fitted to a rod , and pressed down into a pot of boiling water . The coffee press was patented by Milanese designer Attilio Calimani in 1929 . It underwent several design modifications through Faliero Bondanini , who patented his own version in 1958 and began manufacturing it in a French clarinet factory called Martin S.A. , where its popularity grew . It was further popularized across Europe by a British company by the name of Household Articles Ltd. , and most notably , the Danish tableware and kitchenware company , Bodum . The modern French press consists of a narrow cylindrical beaker usually made of glass or clear plastic , equipped with a lid and a `` plunger '' , made of metal or plastic , which fits tightly in the cylinder and which has a fine wire or nylon mesh filter . The simplicity of the mechanism and its potential for attractive after-dinner presentation have led to a variety of more-or-less aesthetic designs . A French press requires coffee of a coarser grind than does a drip brew coffee filter , as finer grounds will seep through the press filter and into the coffee . Coffee is brewed by placing the coffee and water together , stirring it and leaving to brew for a few minutes , then pressing the plunger to trap the coffee grounds at the bottom of the beaker . Because the coffee grounds remain in direct contact with the brewing water and the grounds are filtered from the water via a mesh instead of a paper filter , coffee brewed with the French press captures more of the coffee 's flavor and essential oils , which would become trapped in a traditional drip brew machine 's paper filters . As with drip-brewed coffee , French pressed coffee can be brewed to any strength by adjusting the amount of ground coffee which is brewed . If the used grounds remain in the drink after brewing , French pressed coffee left to stand can become bitter , though this is an effect that many users of French press consider beneficial . For a 1\/2 l French press , the contents are considered spoiled , by some reports , after around 20 minutes . Other approaches consider a brew period that may extend to hours as a method of superior production . French presses are more portable and self contained than other coffee makers . Travel mug versions exist which are made of tough plastic instead of the more common glass , and have a sealed lid with a closable drinking hole . Some versions are marketed to hikers and backpackers not wishing to carry a heavy , metal percolator or a filter using drip brew . Other versions include stainless steel , insulated presses designed to keep the coffee hot , similar in design to thermos flasks . A French press can also be used in place of a tea infuser to brew loose tea . However , the tea will continue to steep even after the plunger is depressed , causing the tea remaining in the press to become bitter and undrinkable .

Valentino Mazzola ( January 26 , 1919 - May 4 , 1949 ) was an Italian footballer and captain of the legendary Grande Torino side killed in the Superga air disaster . He is considered one of the best football players of all time and perhaps the first modern all-around footballer , as he was an attacking midfielder who could score , tackle , defend and lead his teammates to victory with his charismatic presence ( Mazzola was famous for raising his shirt 's sleeves when his team was not playing well as a signal to his teammates and the fans ) . Mazzola was born at Cassano d'Adda , in the province of Milan . Mazzola first broke into football by playing for the team at the Alfa Romeo Milano factory where he worked , just before the war . In 1939 , Mazzola was called up to join the Italian Navy at Venezia . While there , he was encouraged to attend the trials at Venezia A.C. and did so . When the 20 year old Mazzola was informed that no boots were available for him , he replied `` I can even play barefooted '' . It was during this time at Venezia that Mazzola first met Ezio Loik , when the latter moved to the club from Milan . A nine-year partnership in both triumph and tragedy began . They debuted together in the 1942 game Italy played against Croatia and won 4-0 . Both were very different , although they came from very humble backgrounds : Fiume-born Loik was quiet and somewhat defensive , while Lombard Mazzola was much more impulsive and friendly . Loik did not like Valentino at first instance , taking his reserve for arrogance , but both soon found a way of understanding each other . The partnership of both half-wings ( mezzala in Italian ) was based on the Fiuman 's stubborn generosity and the Milanese 's rare talent . Soon , they became Italy 's most coveted uprising young players . Ironically for a man later to die in an accident himself , at the age of ten , Mazzola saved the life of Andrea Bonomi , later a defender for A.C. Milan , by rescuing him from a river . Mazzola 's career with Venezia started modestly , with a tenth-placed finish in 1940 and a twelfth-place finish the next season . In 1941 , however , the team won the Coppa Italia Final against Roma and finished third in the league in 1942 . Mazzola then made his debut for the national side on April 5 , 1942 , when he scored a goal . As they finished third in the league , Venezia were only a single point behind Torino , who promptly began to take notice of Mazzola . The only problem was that Juventus had a verbal agreement with Venezia that they would sign Mazzola . However , Torino eventually offered two hundred thousand lira plus two players and won the player 's signature . Although the deal was intended to be kept secret , news of the upcoming move got out and as Venezia played Torino , the crowd began to taunt Mazzola , calling him a `` sell-out '' . The outraged Mazzola clenched his fists and promptly led Venezia to a 3-1 win . With Torino , Mazzola won the wartime league title in 1943 . In 1944 , the championship ended early , but Mazzola managed to score 10 goals ( in context , however , Silvio Piola scored 31 ) . In 1946 , Mazzola helped the team to the title , which they won over Inter Milan by 13 points . The next season , Torino won the title again , beating second-placed Juventus by 10 points . In 1948 , Torino broke numerous records , including ending the season with the biggest ever advantage over the second-placed team ( they beat Milan to the title by 16 points ) and on May 11 , 1947 , Torino provided 10 of the 11 players who took to the field against Hungary . Mazzola played 12 matches with the Italian National Team and scored 4 goals . In the 1948-49 season , Torino won the last title they would get until 1976 . Mazzola scored 109 goals in the Italian Championship with Venezia and Torino over 8 years . Mazzola 's first child , Sandro Mazzola , was born on November 8 , 1942 , just after Valentino had arrived at Torino . On February 1 , 1945 , his second son was born and was named ` Ferruccio ' after Ferruccio Novo , the president of Torino . Around 1946 , however , his marriage ended in divorce . Valentino remarried and got custody of one son , Sandro . The football lessons given to Alessandro by his father would pay off later , when the young boy would play for Inter Milan and Italy . He won 4 Championship , 2 Champions Cups , 2 Intercontinental Cups and the 1968 European Cup with Italy , and played in the 1970 World Cup final against Pele 's great Brazil team . Despite suffering from illness , Mazzola was determined to attend the match he had organised for Torino in Lisbon in 1949 . On May 4 , on the return journey from the game , the aircraft carrying Mazzola and the rest of the team crashed , killing everyone on board and leaving only one first-team player at Torino alive .

The name comes from the Greek para ( `` beside '' , i.e. , abnormal ) and aisthesia ( `` sensation '' ) . Paresthesias of the hands and feet are common , transient symptoms of the related conditions of hyperventilation syndrome , often open mouth , and panic attacks . Other common examples occur when sustained pressure has been applied over a nerve , inhibiting\/stimulating its function . Removing the pressure will typically result in gradual relief of these paresthesias , often described as a `` pins and needles '' feeling . Chronic paresthesia indicates a problem with the functioning of neurons . In older individuals , paresthesia is often the result of poor circulation in the limbs ( such as in peripheral vascular disease , also referred to by physicians as PVD or PAD ) , most often caused by atherosclerosis , the build up of plaque within artery walls , over decades , with eventual plaque ruptures , internal clots over the ruptures and subsequent clot healing but leaving behind narrowing of the artery openings or closure , both locally and in downstream smaller branches . Without a proper supply of blood and nutrients , nerve cells can no longer adequately send signals to the brain . Because of this , paresthesia can also be a symptom of vitamin deficiency and malnutrition , as well as metabolic disorders like diabetes , hypothyroidism , and hypoparathyroidism . Irritation to the nerve can also come from inflammation to the tissue . Joint conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome are common sources of paresthesia . Nerves below the head may be compressed where chronic neck and spine problems exist and can be caused by , amongst other things , muscle cramps which may be a result of clinical anxiety or excessive mental stress , bone disease , poor posture , unsafe heavy-lifting practices or physical trauma such as whiplash . Paresthesia can also be caused simply by putting pressure on a nerve by applying weight ( or pressure ) to the limb for extended periods of time . Another cause of paresthesia , however , may be direct damage to the nerves themselves , i.e. , neuropathy , which itself can stem from injury or infection such as frostbite or Lyme disease , or which may be indicative of a current neurological disorder . Chronic paresthesia can sometimes be symptomatic of serious conditions , such as a transient ischemic attack , motor neuron disease , or autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus . The herpes zoster virus ( shingles ) can attack nerves causing numbness instead of pain commonly associated with shingles . A diagnostic evaluation by a medical doctor is necessary to rule these out . Demyelinating diseases may also cause cross-talk between adjacent axons and lead to parasthesia . During impulse conduction some aberrant current that escaped a demyelinated axon can circulate in the exterior and depolarize an adjacent demyelinated , hyperexcitable axon . This can generate impulses conducted in both directions along this axon since no part of the axon is in a refractory state . This becomes very serious in conditions such as multiple sclerosis and Guillainâ `` BarrÃ syndrome . Acroparesthesia is severe pain in the extremities , and may be caused by Fabry disease , a type of sphingolipidosis . The nerve conduction study usually provides useful information for making diagnosis . A CT scan is sometimes used to rule out some causes from the central nervous system . Medications offered can include the immunosuppressant prednisone , intravenous gamma globulin ( IVIG ) , anticonvulsants such as gabapentin or Gabitril and antiviral medication , amongst others , according to the underlying cause . In addition to treatment of the underlying disorder , palliative care can include the use of topical numbing creams , such as lidocaine or prilocaine . Care must be take to apply only the necessary amount , as excess can contribute to the condition . Otherwise , these products offer extremely effective , but short-lasting , relief from the condition . In some cases , rocking the head from side to side will painlessly remove the `` pins and needles '' sensation in less than a minute . A tingly hand or arm is often the result of compression in the bundle of nerves in the neck . Loosening the neck muscles releases the pressure . Compressed nerves lower in the body govern the feet , and standing up and walking around will typically relieve the sensation . An arm that has `` fallen asleep '' may also be `` awoken '' more quickly by clenching and unclenching the fist several times ; the muscle movement increases blood flow and helps the limb return to normal . However , in some cases this clenching action simply exacerbates the discomfort . More rapid relief can sometimes be obtained by gently and systematically massaging the affected area of the body . Manipulation of the neck may aid facial paresthesia , as the trigeminal nerve which innervates the face originates in the upper portion of the spinal cord . Manipulation can also be particularly beneficial when paresthesia is present in the upper or lower extremities . Manipulation should only be carried out by an appropriately qualified chiropractor , osteopath , physical therapist or physician specifically skilled to do so . Paresthesia caused by shingles is treated with appropriate antiviral medication .

Heinz Strehl ( 20 July 1938 â `` 11 August 1986 ) was a former German football player . A Bundesliga title-winner with 1 . FC Nuremberg in 1968 , Heinz Strehl was one of the proven goalscorers in West Germany in the 1960s and able to cap his West Germany debut against Yugoslavia on 30 September 1962 , with a hat-trick in between the 23rd and the 62nd minute . An effort that still lists Strehl among the fastest fifteen hat-trick outputs in West German football history . Thanks to Strehl 's goals West Germany came out 3-2 winner in Zagreb that day . Beforehand , Strehl had already been part of Sepp Herberger 's squad at the 1962 FIFA World Cup , not making any appearance . He added a fourth goal to his West German tally in spring 1965 against Cyprus ( 5-0 ) in a World Cup qualifier that remained his final match for West Germany . Nominally a center forward , Strehl 's international career was hindered by Uwe Seeler , who played in the same position , which meant that Strehl would only get first team action when Seeler was not available . As a player , he was resilient and great at heading but also technically sound . Oftentimes he was used as an inside forward due to his good passing skills and vision . Apart from winning the Bundesliga in 1968 , Strehl also won the West German football championship in 1961 and the West German Cup in 1962 . After suffering a meniscus injury in 1970 , Strehl retired from professional football . He continued to act as a player manager for FC Schwaig until 1973 . Aged 48 , Heinz Strehl died on 11 August 1986 , of heart failure .
Acoustic music comprises music that solely or primarily uses instruments which produce sound through entirely acoustic means , as opposed to electric or electronic means . The retronym `` acoustic music '' appeared after the advent of electric instruments , such as the electric guitar , electric violin , electric organ and synthesizer . Performers of acoustic music often increase the volume of their output using electronic amplifiers . However , these amplification devices remain separate from the amplified instrument and reproduce its natural sound accurately . Often a microphone is placed in front of an acoustic instrument which is then wired up to an amplifier . Following the increasing popularity of the television show MTV Unplugged during the 1990s , acoustic ( though in most cases still electrically-amplified ) performances by musical artists who usually rely on electronic instruments became colloquially referred to as `` unplugged '' performances . Writing for Splendid , music reviewer Craig Conley suggests , `` When music is labeled acoustic , unplugged , or unwired , the assumption seems to be that other types of music are cluttered by technology and overproduction and therefore are n't as pure .

Yuri Valeryevich Nikiforov ( alternate spelling Valeriovych ; , , born 16 September 1970 ) is a retired Ukrainian-Russian footballer , who played mainly as a central defender . Born in Odessa , Ukraine , Nikiforov started playing professionally with hometown 's FC Chornomorets . After one year with FC Dynamo Kyiv solely appearing for the reserve side , he returned to his first club , playing in the inaugural edition of the Ukrainian Premier League . In early 1993 , Nikiforov moved to Russia with FC Spartak Moscow , being an instrumental defensive unit as the capital side won three out of four league titles , with the player also netting regularly . His first abroad experience came with Sporting de GijÃ n , to where he arrived at the same time as former compatriot Dmitri Cheryshev ( he would also share team with another Russian while in Asturias , Igor Lediakhov ) . After GijÃ n 's relegation from La Liga , Nikiforov played five years in Holland , starting with PSV Eindhoven , which he helped to consecutive Eredivisie accolades . In 2002 -- 03 , the 32-year old played with lowly RKC Waalwijk , with the club finishing in a comfortable ninth place . He finished his career in Japan , after one year with Urawa Red Diamonds . Nikiforov played four times for the Commonwealth of Independent States in 1992 , as the national team that rose from the ashes of the Soviet Union took part in that year 's UEFA European Football Championship - he did not make the squad for the finals . His debut came on January 25 , in a 1 -- 0 friendly with the United States , in Miami . After briefly representing Ukraine , also in that year , Nikiforov switched to Russia , with which he would participate in two FIFA World Cups - 1994 and 2002 - as well as UEFA Euro 1996 ( eight matches in total , but with the national side always exiting in the group stage ) . In 2009 , Nikiforov was part of the Russian squad that won the Legends Cup . Nikiforov 's older brother , Oleksandr , also played professional football , also representing Chornomorets ( four different spells ) , and coinciding with Yuri from 1989 -- 90 .
`` Wibbling Rivalry '' is the title of a single released under the name `` Oas \* s '' by the Fierce Panda record label in 1995 . It is a recording of John Harris ( working for NME at the time ) interviewing brothers Noel Gallagher and Liam Gallagher of Oasis in early 1994 , on the verge of their commercial breakthrough . The musicians live up to their reputation as feuding siblings by getting sidetracked into a curse-laden argument over an incident that happened on a ferry . As such , the title is a portmanteau of the expression sibling rivalry and the word wibble . The single contains a ` Liam Track ' featuring predominantly Liam 's use of profanities and a ` Noel Track ' featuring Noel . `` Wibbling Rivalry '' holds the record as the highest charting interview release in the UK , reaching number 52 on November 25 , 1995 .
Social studies is the `` integrated study of the social sciences and humanities to promote civic competence , '' as defined by the National Council for the Social Studies . Social studies is most commonly recognized as the name of a course or set of courses taught in primary and secondary schools or elementary , middle , and high schools , but may also refer to the study of particular aspects of human society at certain post-secondary and tertiary schools around the globe . At the elementary school level , social studies generally focuses first on the local community and family . By middle and high school , the social studies curriculum becomes more discipline-based and content-specific . It includes various fields which involve past and current human behavior and interactions , such as sociology , history , political science , economics , religion , geography , psychology , anthropology , and civics .
Tramway track is used on tramways or light rail operations . Grooved rails ( or girder rails ) are often used in order to make street running feasible . Like standard rail tracks , tram tracks consist of two parallel steel rails . Tram rails can be placed in several surfaces , such as with standard rails on sleepers like railway tracks , or with grooved rails on concrete sleepers into street surfaces ( pavement ) for street running . Another environmentally-friendly or ecologically-friendly alternative is to lay tracks into grass turf surfaces ; this is known as grassed track ( or track in a lawn ) , first used in Liverpool in 1924 . The first tramways were laid in 1832 in New York by John Stephenson , to assist horses pulling buses through dirt roads , especially in wet weather when muddy . By laying rails , a horse could easily pull a load of 10 tonnes rather than 1 tonne on a dirt road . The evolution of street tramway tracks paralleled the development from horse power to mechanical , especially electric power . In a dirt road , the rails needed a foundation , usually a mass concrete raft . Highway authorities often made tramway companies pave the rest of the road , usually with granite or similar stone blocks , an extra cost . The first tramways had a rail projecting above the road surface , or a step set into the road , both of which were apt to catch the narrow tyres of horse drawn carriages . The invention by Alphonse Loubat in 1852 of grooved rail enabled tramways to be laid without causing a nuisance to other road users , except unsuspecting cyclists , who could get their wheels caught in the groove . Electrification needed other developments , most notably heavier rails to cope with electric tramcars weighing 12 tonnes rather than the 4 tonne horse-drawn variety ; switching points , as electric trams could not be pulled onto the correct track by horses ; and the need for electrical connections , to provide the return path for the electric current , which was usually supplied through an overhead wire . Prior to the universal introduction of electric power , many tramways were cable hauled , with a continuous cable carried in a conduit under the road , and with a slot in the road surface through which the tram could clasp the cable for motion . This system can still be seen in San Francisco in California as well as the system of the Great Orme in Wales . These needed a rather more substantial track formation . In some cities where overhead electric cables were deemed intrusive , underground conduits with electrical conductors were used . Examples of this were New York , Washington DC , Paris , London , Brussels and Budapest . The conduit system of electrical power was very expensive to install and maintain , although Washington did not close until 1962 . Attempts were made with alternative systems not needing overhead wires . There were many systems of â surfaceâ contact , where studs were set in the road surface , and energised by a passing tram , either mechanically or magnetically to supply power through a skate carried under the tram . Unfortunately these systems all failed due to the problem of reliability and not always turning off after the tram had passed , resulting in the occasional electrocution of horses and dogs . In the last five years a new system of surface contact has been installed in the Bordeaux tramway by Alstom . A grooved rail , groove rail , or girder rail is a special rail designed for tramway or railway track in pavement or grassed surfaces ( grassed track or track in a lawn ) . This was invented in 1852 by Alphonse Loubat , a French inventor who developed improvements in tram and rail equipment , and helped develop tram lines in New York City and Paris . An alternative to the conventional girder profiled grooved track is the LR55 profile . This is considerably cheaper and easier to install and maintain than conventional girder rail as it requires a smaller footprint foundation and existing utility services need not be disturbed .

Arsenal tube station is a London Underground station located in Highbury , London . It is on the Piccadilly Line , in Travelcard Zone 2 , between Holloway Road and Finsbury Park . Originally known as Gillespie Road , it was renamed in 1932 after Arsenal Football Club , who at the time played at the nearby Arsenal Stadium . It is the only Tube station named directly after a football club . Although Arsenal Stadium closed in 2006 , the station retains its name and is still used by spectators attending matches at Arsenal 's new Emirates Stadium , but it is otherwise quieter than other stations on the same stretch of line . Arsenal tube station was opened by the Great Northern , Piccadilly and Brompton Railway ( GNP&BR ) as Gillespie Road on 15 December 1906 . The GNP&BR later renamed the Piccadilly line after the consolidation & nationalisation of the Tube network as London Underground . The original station building and ticket hall were red terracotta-clad buildings designed by Leslie Green , similar to neighbouring Holloway Road and Caledonian Road stations . At the time of Gillespie Road 's construction , it served a residential area and a local divinity college . In 1913 , Arsenal Football Club moved to Highbury on the site of the college 's playing fields , and the club 's presence there eventually led to a campaign for a change of name . Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman was a particularly keen advocate , and on 5 November 1932 it was renamed Arsenal ( Highbury Hill ) . The station was expanded in the 1930s , with the original station building demolished and being replaced with a wider building of a more modern design . The ( Highbury Hill ) suffix was dropped from the station 's name some time around 1960 , giving the current name of Arsenal . The original tiled walls of the platforms still bear the Gillespie Road name , spelt out in large letters . In 2007 , the station underwent a major upgrade ; as part of this the wall tiling was completely restored , the floor resurfaced and an electronic Tannoy system introduced . The station is in a narrow Victorian residential street : when built , the station building was squeezed incongruously between residential properties on each side , occupying the width of just two terraced houses . Even after the surface building was rebuilt in the early 1930s and widened , with a further house being demolished , it has one of the narrowest frontages of any underground station . It is also unusual in not having any bus routes pass its entrance , though routes 4 , 19 , 106 and 236 serve nearby Blackstock Road . Unusually for a `` deep level '' tube station , Arsenal possesses neither escalators nor lifts . Instead , a sloping passageway leads down to the platforms . This is due to the combination of the tunnels being both relatively shallow at this point and being some distance from the station entrance ( being underneath the East Coast Main Line ) . Due to short flights of stairs at both ends of the passageway the station is not wheelchair accessible . When the station was rebuilt in the early 1930s an extra tunnel was dug to platform level from the main access passage in anticipation of increased traffic , which is now used to handle the large crowds on match days . The station has a `` tidal '' system unique on the Underground network , with a narrow section on one side divided from the main passageway by a full-height fence . The narrow section is used on match days for the lighter flow , according to time of day - for passengers catching trains before matches , or leaving the station afterwards . The station is located in a residential area , away from any main roads , and is considerably less busy than other stations on the same stretch of line . In 2007 only 2.735 million entries and exits were recorded , compared with Holloway Road 's 7.487 m and Caledonian Road 's 5.333 m. It is largely deserted outside rush hours except on Arsenal match days . In 2006 Arsenal FC moved to a new stadium , the Emirates Stadium . The stadium is on the site of Ashburton Grove , a former industrial estate approximately 500 yards from Highbury , and closer to Drayton Park and Holloway Road stations . However , Drayton Park ( along with the rest of the Northern City Line ) is closed on weekends and weekday evenings , and trains do not stop at Holloway Road before and after matches to prevent overcrowding . Arsenal station meanwhile is still within easy walking distance of the new stadium and is recommended by the club for use on matchdays . The station thus still retains the `` Arsenal '' name and , along with Finsbury Park and Highbury & Islington , is still used by many Arsenal supporters to get to matches . As part of the commemoration of Arsenal 's move , a temporary mural was placed along the walls of the station passageways as part of London Underground 's Art on the Underground scheme . It was unveiled in February and removed in September 2006 .

Lidl ( generally in English-speaking countries and in its country of origin ) is a German discount supermarket chain that operates over 7200 stores worldwide . The company 's full name is Lidl Stiftung & Co. . KG . It belongs to the holding company Schwarz , which also owns the store chains Handelshof and Kaufland . Lidl is the chief competitor of the similar German discount chain Aldi . Founded in the 1930s by a member of the Schwarz family ( and called at the time Schwarz Lebensmittel-Sortimentsgro Ã handlung ( Schwarz Assorted wholesale Foods ) ) , Lidl has â `` since the opening in 1973 of the first of its stores in their present incarnation â `` now established itself in over 20 countries in Europe . In 1930 , Josef Schwarz became a partner in SÃ 1\/4 dfrÃ 1\/4 chte GroÃ handel Lidl & Co. , a fruit wholesaler , and he developed the company into a general food wholesaler . In 1977 , under his son Dieter Schwarz , the Schwarz-Gruppe began to focus on discount markets , larger supermarkets , and cash and carry wholesale markets . The first Lidl discount store was opened in 1973 , copying the Aldi concept . By the year 1977 , the Lidl chain comprised 33 discount stores . Amongst other brands , Lidl owns the Silvercrest brand , which manufactures electronic products such as satellite and Freeview receivers . Most Lidl stores follow the same basic layout flow with tins and carbonated drinks in the first aisle and alcohol in the last . The chiller always runs along the back wall of the store , with chilled convenience foods such as sandwiches , pasta salads and fruit in the first chiller bay . Older stores did not have aisle breaks ( gaps in between the shelving ) , which ensured customers followed the flow of the store . This practice has been largely reduced with older stores being re-merchandised to accommodate these breaks . Fruit and vegetables are normally in the first aisle of the store , as are bread and cakes . The UK stores , however are currently undergoing a major remerchandising program . This is to bring all stores up to date and to follow the same merchandising policies . The major change to the store layout is that the carbonated drinks and fruit juices are moved to the center of the store with the non-food ( specially listed lines ) items in this area moving to the back . This creates a more even layout of the store and creates a more open feel . The increase in the number of food specials ( special offer non-permanent lines ) has resulted in an enlarged area being allocated to these products above the frozen cabinets and highlighted with bright orange day-glo signage . In late October 2009 Lidl UK launched a DVD rental service ` Lidl Movies ' , undercutting Tesco DVD rental which had previously been the UK 's cheapest online DVD rental service . The service is powered by OutNow DVD rental . Trade unions in Germany and other countries have repeatedly criticised Lidl for mistreatment of workers , breach of European directives on working time and other abuses . These have been published in the Black Book on the Schwarz Retail Company published in Germany and now available in English . While The Times notes that Lidl managers work excessive hours , being obliged to sign out of the working time directive when starting with the company , both The Guardian and The Times in the UK amongst other allegations have reported that Lidl spies on its workforce with cameras , makes extensive notes on employee behavior , particularly focusing on attempting to sack female workers who might become pregnant and also forces staff at warehouses to do `` piece-rate '' work . Lidl management has denied the charges . In Italy , in 2003 , a judge in Savona sentenced Lidl for anti-union policies , a crime in that country . Lidl has been criticised in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland for not allowing workers to join unions . In March 2008 the German news magazine Stern released a cover story reporting systematic surveillance of Lidl workers , including the most intimate details of their private affairs . Further instances of Lidl 's purported mistreatment of past and present employees are documented on a website created by a former employee .

Robbie Williams enjoyed a similar success with his 1998 single `` Millennium '' , as did Pulp for their 1995 song `` Disco 2000 '' . The Chen Dynasty ( 557-589 ) , also known as the Southern Chen Dynasty , was the fourth and last of the Southern dynasties in China , eventually destroyed by the Sui Dynasty . When the dynasty was founded by Emperor Wu , it was exceedingly weak , possessing only a small portion of the territory once held by its predecessor Liang Dynasty -- and that portion was devastated by wars that had doomed Liang . However , Emperor Wu 's successors Emperor Wen and Emperor Xuan were capable rulers , and the state gradually solidified and strengthened , becoming roughly equal in power to rivals Northern Zhou and Northern Qi . After Northern Zhou destroyed Northern Qi in 577 , Chen was cornered .
Pasture is land with vegetation cover used for grazing of livestock as part of a farm , or in ranching or other unenclosed pastoral systems or used by wild animals for grazing or browsing . Prior to the advent of factory farming , pasture was the primary source of food for grazing animals such as cattle and horses . It is still used extensively , particularly in arid regions where pasture land is unsuitable for any other agricultural production . In more humid regions , pasture grazing is exploited extensively for free range and organic farming . Pasture growth can consist of grasses , legumes , other forbs , shrubs or a mixture . Soil type , minimum annual temperature , and rainfall are important factors in pasture management .
Levi Lincoln , Sr. ( May 15 , 1749 â `` April 14 , 1820 ) was an American revolutionary and statesman who served as a Minuteman at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War , a state legislator in Massachusetts , a participant in Massachusetts ' state constitutional convention , Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts , a U.S. Representative , Attorney General for President Thomas Jefferson and Acting Secretary of State . Lincoln was born in Hingham , Massachusetts , on May 15 , 1749 . He graduated from Harvard in 1772 and studied law under Joseph Hawley . When the Battle of Lexington occurred he volunteered to fight with the Minutemen . From 1775 to 1781 , he served as clerk of the court and probate judge of Worcester County . Though elected to the Continental Congress in 1781 , he declined to serve . Lincoln was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1796 , and of the Senate in 1797 . In 1800 , he was elected to Congress and served until March 5 , 1801 , when President Jefferson appointed him Attorney General of the United States . He held the office until March 5 , 1805 .

Limburger is a cheese that originated in the historical Duchy of Limburg , which is now divided among modern-day Netherlands , Belgium , and Germany . The cheese , which is especially known for its pungent odor , was first made in the 19th century . It was first produced by Rudolph Benkerts in 1867 in his cellar from pasteurized goat 's milk . A few years later , 25 factories produced this cheese . Today , most Limburger is made in Germany . The Williams Cheese Company , located in Linwood , Michigan , and the Chalet Cheese Cooperative in Monroe , Wisconsin are the only North American companies that make this cheese . Herve cheese is a kind of Limburger produced in the Land of Herve , a region of Wallonia located between the Vesdre and Meuse rivers and the borders separating Belgium from the Netherlands and Germany . In its first month , the cheese is more firm and crumbly , similar to the texture of feta cheese . After about six weeks , the cheese becomes softer along the edges but is still firm on the inside and can be described as salty and chalky . After two months of its life , it is mostly creamy and much smoother . Once it reaches three months , the cheese produces its notorious smell because the bacterium used to ferment Limburger cheese and many other smear-ripened cheeses is Brevibacterium linens , the same one found on human skin that is partially responsible for body odor . One of the most traditional forms of eating limburger is the limburger sandwich . After three months , when the cheese has ripened , it becomes spreadable . The cheese is often spread thickly ( ) 0.5 cm ) on firm textured 100 % rye bread , with a large , thick slice of onion , and is typically served with strong black coffee or lager beer . Alternatively , for heartier eaters , chunks or slices of the cheese up to 1.5 cm thick can be cut off the block and placed in the sandwich . This sandwich still remains very popular among the descendants of German immigrants residing in the midwest part of America , such as in Cincinnati , or German Village in Columbus , Ohio . However , it is markedly less popular among the descendants born after ca . 1960 , mainly because of the permeating smell , and the inconvenience of going to specialty cheese and sausage shops to obtain it . In Wisconsin , the Limburger sandwich can be found on menus at certain restaurants , accompanied with brown mustard . Limburger and its characteristic odor are a frequent butt of jokes and gags . In 2006 , a study showing that the malaria mosquito ( Anopheles gambiae ) is attracted equally to the smell of Limburger and to the smell of human feet earned the Ig Nobel Prize in the area of biology . A 100 grams of Limburger contains about 327 calories and has 27 grams of fat , which is about 42 percent of the daily value of a person eating on a 2,000 calorie per day diet . Although it does provide calcium , protein and Vitamin A , it also makes up for 30 percent of the daily value of cholesterol and 33 percent of the daily value of sodium . This assumes eating 3.5 servings of the cheese . Limburger was used commonly in the gags of Golden Age cartoons ( ex . Porky 's Pastry Pirates ) . The 1979 song `` Dance This Mess Around '' by The B-52 's features the repeatedly shouted line , `` Why do n't you dance with me ? ! I 'm not no limburger ! '' in reference to this cheese 's pungent odor . It was featured in various gags in the comedy shows ` The Three Stooges ' and ` The Little Rascals\/Our Gang ' . Typically , a sick character would accidentally replace a jar of salve with Limburger cheese . This led to the cheese being spread on the character 's chest instead of the salve . The character would then walk in public only to be shooed away because of the stench while the character was oblivious to the fact that he just smeared Limburger cheese on himself . A character in Samuel R Delany 's The Mad Man describes the fermented sperm in his foreskin as `` really first class Limburger '' .
Turban is an English word used to refer to several sorts of headwear . A commonly used synonym is a Pagri , the Indian word for turban . Turbans are a popular form of headgear worn in the Middle East , North Africa and Southwest Asia . They are designed to help keep the user cool in hot desert environments such as the Sahara . A turban is a type of headdress usually worn by Sikhs , Middle Eastern , Central Asians , and South Asians . Contemporary turbans come in many shapes , sizes , and colors . Afghan men wear a variety of turbans , known as Lungee . Lungee is worn in Afghanistan and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan , especially in the tribal areas . The lungee is usually worn in tribal meetings , but a majority of Pashtuns prefer to wear it in everyday life too . In India , turbans are referred to as a Pagri . The word specifically refers to the headdress that is worn by men and needs to be manually tied . There are several styles which are specific to regions , religion , etc. . A Pagri is a symbol of honor and respect across all regions where it is a practice to wear one . It is also why almost of all of these will honor important guests by offering them one to wear . In British period , The Muslim elites of South Asia especially of western Punjab used to wear long pagri which was also a symbol of nobility , honor and respect . In Punjab and Sindh members of the landed aristrocray always wore this pagri . This pagri was a part of full formal dress and was used to wear with Sherwani . The Sikh turban , known as the Dastar , is mandatory for all Khalsa Sikhs to wear . The Pheta is worn in Maharashtra and also has regional variants like Puneri and Kolhapuri pheta . In Mysore and Kodagu the turban is known as the Mysore Peta . The Rajastani turban is commonly called the Pagari . It will vary by caste , class , religion and region . It also serves practical functions like protecting from the elements , used as a pillow , blanket or towel . When unravelled , it is used like a rope where it is tied to a bucket to draw water from the well . The Pagri will also vary in shape , size and color . The color will vary related to occasion it will be worn . For example , Saffron ( associated with valor ) is worn during rallies , White ( associated with peace ) is worn by elders , Pink ( associated with spring ) is worn during the spring season or marriage ceremonies , etc. Turbans have been worn by men and women since the 17th century , without ever becoming very common . Poet Alexander Pope is sometimes depicted wearing a turban . Now that hats are infrequently worn , turbans too are relatively uncommon . They are worn primarily by women of West Indian descent , Karinas . Some women wear them to make a statement of individuality , such as the British social entrepreneur Camila Batmanghelidjh , who usually wears a colourful matching turban and robe . Ethiopian Orthodox Christians usually wear short white turbans made of thin cotton , as do the Ethiopian Muslims . Although the turban is mentioned in the Bible , Christians in general do not see wearing turbans as part of their religious practice . The men of many Islamic cultures have worn or wear a headdress of some sort that may be considered a turban . Islam considers the turban as being a Sunnah Mu ` akkadah ( Confirmed Tradition ) . Head wraps that men wear are called several names and worn in different ways dependent on region and culture . Examples include Amamah in Arabic , `` sarÄ k '' in Turkish and dastÄ r in Persian . In most of the Arabian peninsula countries , they wear a form of turban that is plain or checkered scarf ( called keffiyeh , ghutrah or shumagh ) , though the Arabic Amamah tradition is still strong in Oman ( see Sultan Qaboos of Oman ) , Egypt , Sudan as well as some parts of the Arabian peninsula . Members of the Bobo Shanti mansion of the Rastafari movement have been wearing turbans over their dreadlocks along with robes since their founding in the 1950s , which make them highly distinctive in appearance in Jamaica and elsewhere .
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung ( English literally Frankfurt General Newspaper ) , short F.A.Z. , also known as the FAZ , is a national German newspaper , founded in 1949 . It is published daily in Frankfurt am Main . The Sunday edition is the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung ( F.A.S. ) . F.A.Z. has a circulation of 366,844 ( 3rd quarter 2008 ) and has a slight centre-right or conservative bias . The F.A.Z. has the legal form of a GmbH . The independent FAZIT-Stiftung ( FAZIT Foundation ) is its majority shareholder . About 40 percent of its shares are held by the company itself . The F.A.Z. runs its own correspondent network . Its editorial policy is not determined by a single editor , but cooperatively by five editors . It is the German newspaper with the widest circulation abroad , with its editors claiming to deliver the newspaper to 148 countries every day . The first edition of the F.A.Z. appeared on November 1 , 1949 ; its founding editor was Erich Welter . Some editors had worked for the Frankfurter Zeitung which was banned in 1943 . Traditionally , many of the headlines in the F.A.Z. were styled in orthodox blackletter format and no photographs appeared on the title page . Some of the rare exceptions were a picture of the celebrating people in front of the Reichstag in Berlin on the German Unity Day on 4 October 1990 , and the two pictures in the edition of 12 September 2001 showing the collapsing World Trade Center and the American president George W. Bush . Since October 5 , 2007 , the F.A.Z. altered their traditional layout to include color photographs on the front page and exclude blackletter typeface outside the nameplate . Currently , the F.A.Z. is produced electronically using the Networked Interactive Content Access ( NICA ) and Hermes . For its characteristic comment headings , a digital Fraktur font was ordered . The Fraktur has since been abandoned , however , with the above-mentioned change of layout . After introducing on August 1 , 1999 , the new spelling prescribed by the German spelling reform of 1996 , the F.A.Z. returned exactly one year later to the old spelling , declaring that their experience had shown that the reform was ambiguous and partly nonsensical . After several changes had been made to the new spelling , F.A.Z. accepted it and started using it ( in a custom version ) on January 1 , 2007 . Due to its traditionally sober layout , the introduction of color photographs in the F.A.Z. was controversially discussed by the readers . The F.A.Z. is one of a small number of high-profile national newspapers in Germany ( along with its closest competitors , the SÃ 1\/4 ddeutsche Zeitung , Die Welt and the Frankfurter Rundschau ) . It maintains the largest number of foreign correspondents of any European newspaper ( 53 as of 2002 ) . The F.A.Z. promotes an image of making its readers think . The truth is stated to be sacred to the F.A.Z. , so care is taken to clearly label news reports and comments as such . Its political orientation is classical liberal with an occasional support for conservative views by providing a forum to commentators with different opinions . In particular , the feuilleton and some sections of the Sunday edition can not be said to be specifically conservative or liberal at all .
`` Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite ! '' is a song from the 1967 album by The Beatles , Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . It was composed by John Lennon . The song is credited to Lennon\/McCartney . Lennon was inspired to write the song by a 19th century circus poster for Pablo Fanque 's circus he purchased in an antique shop on 31 January 1967 , while filming the promotional video for `` Strawberry Fields Forever '' in Kent . Lennon said that `` Everything from the song is from that poster , except the horse was n't called Henry . '' ( The poster identifies the horse as `` Zanthus '' . ) Mr. Kite is believed to be William Kite , who worked for Pablo Fanque from 1843 to 1845 . One of the most musically complex songs on Sgt. Pepper , it was recorded on 17 February 1967 with overdubs on 20 February ( organ sound effects ) , 28 March ( harmonica , organ , guitar ) , 29 March ( more organ sound effects ) , and 31 March . Lennon wanted the track to have a `` carnival atmosphere '' , and told producer George Martin that he wanted `` to smell the sawdust on the floor . '' In the middle eight bars , multiple recordings of fairground organs and calliope music were spliced together to attempt to produce this request ; after a great deal of unsuccessful experimentation , Martin instructed Geoff Emerick to chop the tape into pieces with scissors , throw them up in the air , and re-assemble them at random . On 17 February Lennon sings `` For the benefit of Mr. Kite '' in a joke accent , just before Emerick announces , `` For the Benefit of Mr. Kite ! , this is take 1 . '' Lennon immediately responds , `` Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite ! '' , reinforcing his title preference , a phrase lifted intact from the original poster . The exchange is recorded in The Beatles Recording Sessions ( slightly misquoted ) and audible on track 8 of disc 2 of Anthology 2 . The original recording can also be heard during the loading screen for the song if it is downloaded in the video game The Beatles : Rock Band . Although Lennon once said of the song that he `` was n't proud of that '' and `` I was just going through the motions , '' in 1980 he described it as `` pure , like a painting , a pure watercolor . '' It was one of three songs from the Sgt. Pepper album that was banned from playing on the BBC , supposedly because the phrase `` Henry the Horse '' combined two words that were individually known as slang for heroin . Lennon denied that the song had anything to do with heroin . The chords sound somewhat like the theme song from the TV show , `` Get Smart '' ( which began two years earlier and was quite popular at the time ) .
A.C. Milan Roberto Oscar Bonano ( born 24 January 1970 in Rosario , Santa Fe ) is a retired Argentine footballer who played as a goalkeeper . Already in his 30 's , he moved from River Plate to Spain , where he played the remainder of his 17-year professional career , representing three teams , mainly AlavÃ s. Bonano represented in his native country Rosario Central and Club AtlÃ tico River Plate , winning several titles with the latter , including five national championships . In 2001 , at 31 , he moved to FC Barcelona , initially as first-choice ; he made his La Liga debut on 26 August , in a 2 â `` 1 win at Sevilla FC . After the emergence of VÃ ctor ValdÃ s from the Catalans ' youth ranks , Bonano was deemed surplus to requirements , and moved to Real Murcia , then Deportivo AlavÃ s. With the Basque , he was instrumental in a 2005 top flight promotion but , in the following campaign , played second-fiddle to compatriot Franco Costanzo , who also played with him at River , as the season ended in relegation . Bonano 's last year at AlavÃ s was highly turbulent , after being suspended by the club 's elusive chairman\/owner\/manager Dmitry Pietrman , after the latter had had a run-in with teammate LluÃ s Carreras . He retired at the season 's close , aged 38 . Bonano represented Argentina in various youth levels . He made his senior debut on 28 December 1996 , in a 2 â `` 3 friendly loss with Yugoslavia .
The Sepang International Circuit ( SIC ) is a racing circuit in Sepang , Selangor , Malaysia . It is located near Kuala Lumpur International Airport , approximately 60 km south of the capital city Kuala Lumpur . It is the venue used for the Formula One Malaysian Grand Prix , A1 Grand Prix as well as the Malaysian Motorcycle Grand Prix . It is also used as a venue for many other major motorsport events . The circuit was designed by German designer Hermann Tilke , who would subsequently design the new facilities in Shanghai , Bahrain and Turkey . The main circuit , normally raced in a clockwise direction , is 5.54 kilometres long , and is noted for its sweeping corners and wide straights . The layout is quite unusual , with a very long back straight separated from the pit straight by just one very tight hairpin . Other configurations of the Sepang circuit can also be used . The north circuit is also raced in a clockwise direction . It is basically the first half of the main circuit . The course turns back towards the pit straight after turn 6 and is 2.71 kilometres long in total . The south circuit is the other half of the racecourse . The back straight of the main circuit becomes the pit straight when the south circuit is in use , and joins onto turn 8 of the main circuit to form a hairpin turn . Also run clockwise , this circuit is 2.61 km in length . Sepang International Circuit also features kart racing and motocross facilities .
The mandrill ( Mandrillus sphinx ) is a primate of the Cercopithecidae ( Old-world monkeys ) family , closely related to the baboons and even more closely to the Drill . Both the mandrill and the drill were once classified as baboons in genus Papio , but recent research has determined that they should be separated into their own genus , Mandrillus . The mandrill is the world 's largest species of monkey . The mandrill is recognized by its olive-colored fur and the colorful face and rump of males , a coloration that grows stronger with sexual maturity ; females have duller colors . This coloration becomes more pronounced as the monkey becomes excited and is likely to be an example of sexual selection . The coloration on the rump is thought to enhance visibility in the thick vegetation of the rainforest and aids in group movement . Males average 25 â `` 35 kg ( 55-77 lb ) , females less than half that weight ( 11-14 kg , or 25-30 lb ) . Unusually large males can weigh 50 kg ( 110 lb ) . The average male is 81-90 cm ( 32-36 in ) and the female is 56-66 cm ( 22-26 in ) , with the tail adding another 5 â `` 8 cm ( 2 â `` 3 in ) . They can survive up to 31 years in captivity . Females reach sexual maturity at about 3.5 years . The mandrill is found in the tropical rainforests and occasionally woodlands of southern Cameroon , Gabon , Equatorial Guinea , and Congo . Its distribution is bounded by the Sanaga River to the north and the OgoouÃ and White rivers to the east . Recent research suggests that mandrill populations north and south of the OgoouÃ river are so genetically different as to be separate subspecies . Mandrills are social animals and live in large groups , primarily including females and young males and led by a single dominant male . Most adult males are solitary . It is difficult to accurately estimate group size in the forest , but filming a group crossing a gap between two forest patches or crossing a road is a reliable way of estimating group size . The largest group verifiably observed in this way contained over 1300 individuals , in LopÃ National Park , Gabon -- the largest aggregation of non-human primates ever recorded . The mandrill is an omnivore and acquires its food by foraging ( mainly plants , insects and smaller animals ) from the ground as it is terrestrial . Although the mandrill does not normally hunt larger prey , males have been observed to hunt and consume duiker ( a small antelope ) . Its main natural predators are leopards , pythons and humans . Attacks on subadults by African Crowned Eagles have also been reported . Mandrills are hunted for food throughout their range , either with guns or using dogs and nets . In Cameroon , habitat loss to agriculture is also a threat . A large group of mandrills can cause significant damage to crops in a very short time , and where common they are widely perceived as pests . The gestation ( pregnancy ) time for the mandrill is 6 â `` 7 months and young are usually born between January and April . However , the mandrill mates throughout the year during the estrous cycle , which occurs once every 33 days . The interbirth interval is typically 13 â `` 14 months . During courtship , the female will walk after the male . If the male is interested he will stop and turn towards her . He will then mount her and they will copulate . In the film titled `` Mask of the Mandrill '' in the Nature series , the courtship was outlined differently . The dominant male is the only male in the troop allowed to copulate . He will follow a high ranking , sexually receptive female ( which can be determined by how swollen her posterior is ) smacking his lips and the female will either go along with copulation or will run away . He will continue in this behavior with the same female until he is successful and then he will move on to the next high ranking and sexually receptive female . Mandrill infants are born with their eyes open and with hair . They have a black coat and pink skin for the first two months . They cling to their mother 's belly immediately and can support their own weight . Mothers form bonds with their children , which last into adulthood with the daughters , while the bonds with the sons last only until the males ' sexual maturity . These bonds entail the two sitting with each other and grooming each other .
`` Never Gonna Give You Up '' is a song written and produced by Stock , Aitken & Waterman and sung by English singer Rick Astley . The song was released as the first single from Astley 's multi-million selling debut album , Whenever You Need Somebody . The song was a worldwide number-one hit , initially in the singer 's native United Kingdom in 1987 , where it stayed at number one for five weeks and was the best-selling single of that year . It eventually topped the charts in 25 countries , including the US and Germany . The song won Best British Single at the 1988 Brit Awards . The music video for the song has become the basis for the `` Rickrolling '' Internet meme . In 2008 , Rick Astley won the MTV EMA awards for `` Best Act Ever '' with the song `` Never Gonna Give You Up '' , as a result of collective voting from thousands of people on the internet , due to the popular phenomenon of rickrolling . In the `` Never Gonna Give You Up '' music video , directed by Simon West , and edited by Robert Bannochie a smiling Astley sings and dances to the song in various outfits and venues in west London , sometimes accompanied by backup dancers . A bartender played by Clive Clarke gradually shifts from casually noticing Astley 's singing to being fully engrossed in the song with energetic acrobatic moves . The athletic exertion of many of the other dancers also becomes more intense over the course of Astley 's performance . `` Never Gonna Give You Up '' is the subject of a popular Internet prank known as `` rickrolling '' involving misleading links redirecting to the song 's music video . By May 2007 , the practice had achieved notoriety on the Internet , and it increased in popularity after its use as a 2008 April Fool 's Day joke by various media companies and websites , including YouTube rickrolling all of its featured videos on that day and a website allowing people to Rickroll their friends ' phones . In ' a couple of weeks ' , about 13 million people had been ` rickrolled ' into watching Astley 's video , the BBC reported on 1 April 2008 . `` I think it 's just one of those odd things where something gets picked up and people run with it , '' Astley told the Los Angeles Times in late March 2008 , adding : `` That 's what 's brilliant about the Internet . '' Rick Astley also appeared in the 2008 Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade interrupting a song performed by those on a float promoting the Cartoon Network program Foster 's Home for Imaginary Friends with a lipsynched performance of `` Never Gonna Give You Up '' . In several of its protests against Scientology , Anonymous has employed The Rickroll . In 1997 , the French band 2Be3 covered the song under the name `` Toujours lÃ pour toi '' , which had a great success in France ( number four ) and Belgium ( Wallonia ) ( number 12 ) . The Rickrollerz is a pseudonym used by a group of London dance producers that made a house music cover version of `` Never Gonna Give You Up '' on the day , and in honor of , the London Liverpool Street Station rickmob on 11 April 2008 . In May 2008 , the track entered the UK Club Charts at number 22 . On Friday 11 April 2008 at 6 PM , a group of people made a `` Rickmob '' on the Liverpool Street station , inspired on the rickrolling Internet phenomenon . The song was remixed at the same studio as 20 years earlier , the same day . The `` Rickmob '' was a spontaneous gathering where hundreds of people dressed as Rick Astley joined on Friday 11 April 2008 in Liverpool Street Station for a short rendition of the 80s superhit and then quickly dispersed . They released their own single of `` Never Gonna Give You Up '' the same day .

An oxymoron ( plural oxymorons or oxymora ) ( from Greek á 1\/2 Î 3\/4 Ï Î 1\/4 Ï Ï Î Î 1\/2 , `` sharp dull '' ) is a figure of speech that combines contradictory terms . Oxymorons appear in a variety of contexts , including inadvertent errors such as extremely average and literary oxymorons crafted to reveal a paradox . The most common form of oxymoron involves an adjective-noun combination of two words . For example , the following line from Tennyson 's Idylls of the King contains two oxymorons : Other oxymorons of this kind examples are ; Less often seen are noun-verb combinations of two words , such as the line from Nathan Alterman 's Summer Night . Oxymorons are not always a pair of words ; they can also be devised in the meaning of sentences or phrases . Oxymoron is derived from the 5th century Latin `` oxymoron '' , which is derived from the Ancient Greek '' á 1\/2 Î 3\/4 Ï Ï '' ( oxus , sharp ) + '' Î 1\/4 Ï Ï Ï Ï '' ( mÅ ros , dull ) . The Greek '' á 1\/2 Î 3\/4 Ï Î 1\/4 Ï Ï Î Î 1\/2 '' ( oxumÅ ron ) is not found in the extant Greek sources , according to the Oxford English Dictionary . Richard Lederer assembled a taxonomy of oxymorons in an article in Word Ways in 1990 , running from single-word oxymorons such as `` pianoforte '' ( literally , `` soft-loud '' ) through `` doublespeak oxymora '' ( deliberately intended to confuse ) and `` opinion oxymora '' ( editorial opinions designed to provoke a laugh ) . In general , oxymorons can be divided into expressions that were deliberately crafted to be contradictory and those phrases that inadvertently or incidentally contain a contradiction , often as a result of a punning use of one or both words . Oxymorons are sometimes inadvertently created by errors or sloppiness in conversation ; common examples include extremely average , objective opinion , original copy , and definite possibility . In some cases an inadvertent oxymoron ends up being widely adopted as the name for some concept and ceases to be recognized as an oxymoron . Cases where this has occurred include bittersweet , virtual reality , constant variable , and living dead . Many oxymorons have been popularized in vernacular speech . Unlike literary oxymorons , many of these are not intended to construct a paradox ; they are simply puns . Examples include controlled chaos , open secret , organized mess , alone in a crowd , and accidentally on purpose . There are also examples in which terms that are superficially contradictory are juxtaposed in such a way that there is no contradiction . Examples include same difference , jumbo shrimp , pretty ugly , and hot ice ( where hot means stolen and ice means diamonds , respectively , in criminal argot ) . Whether these may legitimately be called oxymorons is debatable . Writers often use an oxymoron to call attention to an apparent contradiction . For example , Wilfred Owen 's poem The Send-off refers to soldiers leaving for the front line , who `` lined the train with faces grimly gay . '' The oxymoron grimly gay highlights the contradiction between how the soldiers feel and how they act : though they put on a brave face and act cheerful , they feel grim . Although a true oxymoron is `` something that is surprisingly true , a paradox '' , modern usage has brought a common misunderstanding that oxymoron is nearly synonymous with contradiction . The introduction of this usage , the opposite of its true meaning , has been credited to William F. Buckley . Sometimes a pair of terms is claimed to be an oxymoron by those who hold the opinion that the two are mutually exclusive . That is , although there is no inherent contradiction between the terms , the speaker expresses the opinion that the two terms imply properties or characteristics that can not occur together . Such claims may be made purely for humorous effect ; many examples , such as military intelligence , were popularized by comedian George Carlin . Another example is the term civil war , which is not an oxymoron , but can be claimed to be so for humorous effect , if civil is construed as meaning polite rather than between citizens of the same state . Alternatively , such claims may reflect a genuinely held opinion or ideological position . Well-known examples include claims made against `` military intelligence '' , `` government worker '' , `` honest broker '' , `` educational television '' and `` working from home '' . In his book More on Oxymoron , the artist Patrick Hughes discusses and gives examples of visual oxymorons . He writes : `` In the visual version of oxymoron , the material of which a thing is made ( or appears to be made ) takes the place of the adjective , and the thing itself ( or thing represented ) takes the place of the noun . '' The book is currently out of print , but while it remains so is available to download . Examples include waves in the sand , a fossil tree and topiary representing something solid like an ocean liner . Hughes lists further examples of oxymoronic objects including :
In telecommunication , Manchester code ( also known as Phase Encoding , or PE ) is a line code in which the encoding of each data bit has at least one transition and occupies the same time . It therefore has no DC component , and is self-clocking , which means that it may be inductively or capacitively coupled , and that a clock signal can be recovered from the encoded data . Manchester code is widely used ( e.g. in Ethernet ; see also RFID ) . There are more complex codes , such as 8B\/10B encoding , that use less bandwidth to achieve the same data rate but may be less tolerant of frequency errors and jitter in the transmitter and receiver reference clocks . Manchester code ensures frequent line voltage transitions , directly proportional to the clock rate . This helps clock recovery . The DC component of the encoded signal is not dependent on the data and therefore carries no information , allowing the signal to be conveyed conveniently by media ( e.g. Ethernet ) which usually do not convey a DC component . Extracting the original data from the received encoded bit ( from Manchester as per 802.3 ) : Manchester code always has a transition at the middle of each bit period and may ( depending on the information to be transmitted ) have a transition at the start of the period also . The direction of the mid-bit transition indicates the data . Transitions at the period boundaries do not carry information . They exist only to place the signal in the correct state to allow the mid-bit transition . The existence of guaranteed transitions allows the signal to be self-clocking , and also allows the receiver to align correctly ; the receiver can identify if it is misaligned by half a bit period , as there will no longer always be a transition during each bit period . The price of these benefits is a doubling of the bandwidth requirement compared to simpler NRZ coding schemes ( or see also NRZI ) . In the Thomas convention , the result is that the first half of a bit period matches the information bit and the second half is its complement . Manchester encoding is a special case of binary phase-shift keying ( BPSK ) , where the data controls the phase of a square wave carrier whose frequency is the data rate . Such a signal is easy to generate . There are two opposing conventions for the representations of data . The first of these was first published by G. E. Thomas in 1949 and is followed by numerous authors ( e.g. , Tanenbaum ) . It specifies that for a 0 bit the signal levels will be Low-High ( assuming an amplitude physical encoding of the data ) - with a low level in the first half of the bit period , and a high level in the second half . For a 1 bit the signal levels will be High-Low . The second convention is also followed by numerous authors ( e.g. , Stallings ) as well as by IEEE 802.4 ( token bus ) and lower speed versions of IEEE 802.3 ( Ethernet ) standards . It states that a logic 0 is represented by a High-Low signal sequence and a logic 1 is represented by a Low-High signal sequence . If a Manchester encoded signal is inverted in communication , it is transformed from one convention to the other . This ambiguity can be overcome by using differential Manchester encoding .
Santa Fe is the capital city of province of Santa Fe , Argentina . It sits in northeastern Argentina , near the junction of the ParanÃ and Salado rivers . It lies opposite the city of ParanÃ , to which it is linked by the Hernandarias Subfluvial Tunnel . The city is also connected by canal with the port of ColastinÃ on the ParanÃ River . Santa Fe has about 369,000 inhabitants as per the . The metropolitan area has a population of 454,238 , making it the ninth largest in Argentina . Santa Fe is linked to Rosario ( 170 km to the south ) , the largest city in the province , by the Brigadier Estanislao LÃ pez Highway and by National Route 11 , which continues south towards Buenos Aires . Santa Fe was originally founded by Captain Juan de Garay in the nearby site of CayastÃ in 1573 . The site is today an historical park containing the grave of Hernandarias , the first American-born governor in South America . The settlement was moved to the present site in 1653 due to the constant flooding of the CayastÃ River . The city became provincial capital in 1814 , when the territory of the province of Santa Fe was separated from the province of Buenos Aires by the National Constituent Assembly , held in the city in 1853 . Santa Fe is the commercial and transportation center for a rich agricultural area that produces grain , vegetable oils , and meats . The city is the site of the National Technological University - Santa Fe Regional School , Catholic University of Santa Fe ( inaugurated in 1959 ) , and the National University of the Littoral ( first founded as the Provincial University in 1889 , and which changed to its current name in 1919 ) . A suspension bridge was completed in 1924 , though severe flooding partially destroyed it in 1983 ( a second bridge , the OroÃ o , was opened in 1971 ) . The city 's historical role in the Argentine Constitution led national lawmakers to choose it as the site of Constitutional Conventions in 1949 , 1957 , and 1994 . Its location is still not immune to flooding , however . On April 29 , 2003 , the Salado , which empties into the ParanÃ near Santa Fe , rose almost 2 m ( 6.5 ft ) in a few hours following heavy rainfall , and caused a catastrophic flood . No fewer than 100,000 people had to be evacuated , and large sections of the city remained under water more than a week later . That year , the suspension bridge was reopened , and in 2008 , the city 's historic grain silos were converted into the Los Silos Hotel and Casino , and San MartÃ n Street was converted to pedestrian use . The city has a climate considered as `` Humid Subtropical '' or `` Cfa '' by KÃ ppen classification . Winters are generally mild , though minimum temperatures can fall below 0 Â C ( 32 Â F ) on cold nights during the winter . Summers are generally hot and humid . During the most extreme heat waves , temperatures have exceeded 45 Â C ( 113 Â F ) . Temperatures have exceeded 35 Â C ( 95 Â F ) in every season ) . Rainfall can be expected throughout the year though summer is usually the wettest season . Thunderstorms can be intense with frequent lightning , powerful downdraughts and intense precipitation . Santa Fe has a lot of important commercial centres , busy cultural life , interesting options in sports and tourism , numerous artistic and musical events , and an exciting nightlife . There is an important infrastructure for tourism developed due to the building of highways and a subfluvial tunnel and , together with the beauty of the landscape and the various attractions that tourists can enjoy make them feel pleased to choose this region to spend their holidays . Hunting , fishing , excursions , walks by the river , practising water sports on the River ParanÃ ( 18 km away via NÂ 168 National Road ) , visiting the Space Observation Centre or the Zoo - Experimental Station of `` La Esmeralda '' Farm , make the tourist feel amazed and eager to know more about the region . In a nutshell , Santa Fe offers a complete and varied shade of attractions that make one dive into history when visiting monuments , museums or find oneself in the beautiful parks , rivers and streams surrounded by wild flora and fauna .
LuÃ s Mesquita de Oliveira , best known as Luisinho , ( born in Rio de Janeiro , March 29 , 1911 -- died in SÃ # o Paulo , December 27 , 1983 ) was a Brazilian footballer , one of the most valuable strikers of the 1930s . During his career ( 1928-1946 ) he played for Anglo Brasileira , Paulistano , Estudantes SÃ # o Paulo , SÃ # o Paulo and Palmeiras . He won seven SÃ # o Paulo State Championship ( 1930 , 1931 , 1936 , 1940 , 1942 , 1944 , 1946 ) and was top goalscorer of Campeonato Paulista in 1944 with 22 goals scored . He 's also the six best top goalscorer in SÃ # o Paulo Futebol Clube history with 145 goals , and nine best goalscorer in Palmeiras history with 123 goals from 1935 to 1941 . For the Brazil national football team he scored 5 goals at South American Championship 1937 and participated at the 1934 FIFA World Cup , played one match with Spain in Genua , and in the 1938 FIFA World Cup , playing two matches . He died at 72 years old .
The British Rail Class 97\/6 0-6-0 diesel shunting locomotives were purpose-built for departmental duties by Ruston & Hornsby at Lincoln in 1953 ( 97650 ) or 1959 ( 97651-654 ) . There are minor technical differences between 97650 and the 1959 batch . This class of five locomotives is outwardly similar to the Class 04 locomotives built around the same time but , internally , they are quite different . The Class 97\/6 is diesel-electric while the Class 04 is diesel-mechanical . The fleet was originally numbered PWM650-654 in the Western Region Permanent Way Machines series , but were renumbered into the Class 97 series between 1979-1981 . Locomotives were original painted in BR Green livery , which was later superseded by BR Blue and finally Civil Engineering Yellow liveries . They were employed at various locations , including Reading West ( 97650\/653\/654 ) , Gloucester \/ Cardiff Canton ( 97651 ) and Plymouth Laira ( 97652 ) . A special feature of this class is that the electric traction motor can be disengaged from the wheels . This allows the locomotive to be hauled by another locomotive at speeds above 20 mph . With the privatisation of British Rail these locomotives were largely made redundant . Three locomotives had already been withdrawn from traffic , and only nos. 97651 and 97654 survived long enough to pass into English , Welsh and Scottish Railway ownership . Number 97654 was sold to an infrastructure company based in Edinburgh , and remained in use until 2005 , when it was preserved . Number 97651 was one of the first locomotives sold by EWS into preservation . Three of the five locomotives have been preserved on heritage railways . Incomplete remains of 97653 are stored at the former Ministry of Defense depot at Long Marston , Warwickshire . This is the location of the Stratford on Avon and Broadway Railway Society ( SBRS ) but 97653 is not owned by the SBRS .
Australopithecus garhi is a gracile australopithecine species whose fossils were discovered in 1996 by a research team led by Ethiopian paleontologist Berhane Asfaw and Tim White , an American paleontologist . The hominin remains are believed to be a human ancestor species and the final missing link between the Australopithecus genus and the human genus , Homo . Tim White was the scientist to find the first of the key A. garhi fossils in 1996 in the Bouri Formation , located in the Middle Awash of Ethiopia 's Afar Depression . The species was confirmed and established as A. garhi on November 20 , 1997 by the Ethiopian paleoanthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie . The species epithet `` garhi '' means `` surprise '' in the local Afar language . The traits of A. garhi fossils such as BOU-VP-12 \/ 130 are somewhat distinctive from traits typically seen in Australopithecus afarensis and Australopithecus africanus . An example of the distinction can be seen when comparing the Hadar maxilla ( A. afarensis ) to the Bouri specimen of A. garhi . The cranial capacity of A. garhi measures 450cc , the same size as other australopithecines . The mandible classified as Asfaw et al . has a morphology generally believed to be compatible with the same species , yet it is possible that another hominin species may have been found within the same deposits . Studies made on the premolars and molar teeth have a few similarities with those of Paranthropus boisei since they are larger than any other gracile form of australopithecine . It has been suggested that if A. garhi is ancestral to Homo ( ie . Homo habilis ) the maxillary morphology would have undergone a rapid evolutionary change in roughly 200,000 and 300,000 years . Few primitive shaped stone tool artifacts closely resembling Olduwan technology were discovered with the A. garhi fossils , dating back roughly 2.5 and 2.6 million years old . The tools are suggested to be older than those acquired by Homo habilis , which is thought to be a possible direct ancestor of more modern hominins . For a long time anthropologists assumed that only members of early genus Homo had the ability to produce sophisticated tools . However , the crude ancient tools lack several techniques that are generally seen in later forms Olduwan and Acheulean such as strong rock-outcroppings . In another site in Bouri , Ethiopia , roughly 3,000 stone artifacts had been found to be an estimated 2.5 million years old in age .

Louis VI ( 1 December 1081 â `` 1 August 1137 ) , called the Fat , was King of France from 1108 until his death ( 1137 ) . Chronicles called him `` roi de Saint-Denis '' . The first member of the House of Capet to make a lasting contribution to the centralising institutions of royal power , Louis was born in Paris , the son of Philip I and his first wife , Bertha of Holland . Almost all of his twenty-nine-year reign was spent fighting either the `` robber barons '' who plagued Paris or the Norman kings of England for their continental possession of Normandy . Nonetheless , Louis VI managed to reinforce his power considerably and became one of the first strong kings of France since the division of the Carolingian Empire . His biography by his constant advisor Abbot Suger of Saint Denis renders him a fully-rounded character to the historian , unlike most of his predecessors . In his youth , Louis fought the Duke of Normandy , Robert Curthose , and the lords of the royal demesne , the Ã le de France . He became close to Suger , who became his adviser . He succeeded his father on Philip 's death on 29 July 1108 . Louis 's half-brother prevented him from reaching Rheims and so he was crowned on 3 August in the cathedral of OrlÃ ans by Daimbert , Archbishop of Sens. The archbishop of Reims , Ralph the Green , sent envoys to challenge the validity of the coronation and anointing , but to no avail . On Palm Sunday 1115 , Louis was present in Amiens to support the bishop and inhabitants of the city in their conflict with Enguerrand I of Coucy , one of his vassals , who refused to recognize the granting of a charter of communal privileges . Louis came with an army to help the citizens to besiege Castillon ( the fortress dominating the city , from which Enguerrand was making punitive expeditions ) . At the siege , the king took an arrow to his hauberk , but the castle , considered impregnable , fell after two years . Just before his death in 1137 , William X , Duke of Aquitaine appointed Louis guardian of his daughter and heir , the young Eleanor of Aquitaine , and expressed his wish for her to marry Louis ' son . The prospect of adding the Aquitaine to his son 's domains made him so happy he could hardly speak . Louis VI died on 1 August 1137 , at the castle of BÃ thisy-Saint-Pierre , nearby Senlis and CompiÃ gne , of dysentery . He was interred in Saint Denis Basilica . He was succeeded on the throne by his son Louis VII , called `` the Younger , '' who had originally wanted to be a monk . He married in 1104 : 1 ) Lucienne de Rochefort â '' the marriage was annulled on 23 May 1107 at the Council of Troyes by Pope Paschal II .

Enzo Maresca ( born 10 February 1980 ) is an Italian footballer , who currently plays for MÃ laga CF in Spanish La Liga . Maresca started playing youth football at A.C. Milan , before joining Cagliari . He got his senior debut with English club West Bromwich Albion in 1998 , where he played for two seasons . He moved back to Italy and joined Juventus FC in January 2000 , at the age of 19 , in a transfer deal worth 4.3 million Pound sterling , a club record sale for Albion . Despite showcasing a high level of promise in his Juventus career , he was , along with fellow young teammates , loaned out to various clubs . He was loaned to Bologna in October 2000 , where he spent the remaining part of the 2000 â `` 01 season . Maresca joined Piacenza in summer 2002 in co-ownershp deal , who bought joint ownership of Maresca . As Piacenza were relegated , Juventus back the 50 % registration rightsfrom Piacenza for â 2.6 million . As a Juventus player , he never really got a chance . He is remembered for the time he scored a goal against Juve 's intercity rivals Torino , and celebrated by imitating a bull , the Torino symbol . Fiorentina signed Maresca along with Fabrizio Miccoli and Giorgio Chiellini for â 13 million , which Juventus still holds half of registration rights . Maresca himself was tagged for â 2.5 million for joint-ownership . At the end of season , Fiorentina only able to finish on top of relegated team , and Juventus bought back all three for â 6.7 million in blind auction between the clubs . Fiorentina at the time not having the funds to put together solid bids for the three players . In August 2005 , he moved from Juventus to join Sevilla in Spain , for a transfer fee of â 2.5 million . At Sevilla , he quickly emerged as a key player in midfield , crowning his debut season by capturing the UEFA Cup 2005-06 trophy , scoring two goals and being named Man of the Match in the final as Sevilla swept aside Middlesbrough 4 â `` 0 . He was also influential in their successful defense of their title in 2007 when they beat Catalan side Espanyol . Maresca donated the â 10.000 Man of the Match prize money to the San Juan de Dios hospital in Seville . On the July 13 , 2009 , Maresca transferred to Olympiacos in 3-year deal . He made his first official debut against Slovan Bratislava and scored a close header in the second leg at home . Maresca scored again in his first League match against AEL 1964 FC . After rescinding his contract with Olympiakos in August 2010 , Maresca trained with his former club , Fiorentina , to maintain match fitness . On 7 December 2010 it was announced that Maresca had been in talks with MÃ laga CF and he would undergo a medical examination before signing a two-year contract with an option to third with the Andalusian based club . Since 1995 , Maresca has represented various youth national teams . He was selected for the Italy national under-20 football team in the 2000 Toulon Tournament . He also finished runner-up with Italy U18 at 1999 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship . He missed the 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship final due to injury .

Luigi Alyisio Galvani ( September 9 , 1737 â `` December 4 , 1798 ) was an Italian physician and physicist who lived and died in Bologna . In 1791 , he discovered that the muscles of dead frogs legs twitched when struck by a spark . This was one of the first forays into the study of bioelectricity , a field that still today studies the electrical patterns and signals of the nervous system . He was cutting the frogs ' legs as an experiment trying to prove that a frogÂ s testicles were actually in their legs . He was quickly proved wrong by other biologists at the University of Pavia . At first he wished to enter the church , but he was educated by his parents for a medical career . Galvani attended Bologna 's medical school and became a doctor , like his father . At the University of Bologna he was , in 1762 , appointed public lecturer in anatomy , and gained a reputation as a skilled though not eloquent teacher , chiefly from his researches on the organs of hearing and genitourinary tract of birds , as a comparative anatomist . He enunciated his celebrated theory of animal electricity in the treatise , De viribus electricitatis in motu musculari commentarius ( `` Commentary on the Force of Electricity on Muscular Motion '' ) published in the seventh volume of the proceedings of the Institute of Sciences at Bologna in 1791 , and separately at Modena in the following year . In 1764 , he married Lucia Galleazzi , a daughter of a professor at the University of Bologna and a popular lady with high social status . In 1772 Galvani became president of the University . According to popular version of the story , Galvani dissected a frog at a table where he had been conducting experiments with static electricity . Galvani 's assistant touched an exposed sciatic nerve of the frog with a metal scalpel , which had picked up a charge . At that moment , they saw sparks and the dead frog 's leg kick as if in life . The observation made Galvani the first investigator to appreciate the relationship between electricity and animation â '' or life . This finding provided the basis for the new understanding that electrical energy ( carried by ions ) , and not air or fluid as in earlier balloonist theories , is the impetus behind muscle movement . He is poorly credited with the discovery of bioelectricity . Galvani called the term animal electricity to describe the force that activated the muscles of his specimens . Along with contemporaries , he regarded their activation as being generated by an electrical fluid that is carried to the muscles by the nerves . The phenomenon was dubbed galvanism , after Galvani , on the suggestion of his peer and sometime intellectual adversary Alessandro Volta . Today , the study of galvanic effects in biology is called electrophysiology , the term galvanism being used only in historical contexts . Volta 's investigations led shortly to the invention of an early battery , but not by Galvani , who did not perceive electricity as separable from biology . Galvani did not see electricity as the essence of life , which he regarded vitalistically . Galvani believed that the animal electricity came from the muscle . Galvani 's associate Alessandro Volta , in opposition , reasoned that the animal electricity was a physical phenomenon , a metallic electricity . While , as Galvani believed , all life is indeed electrical , specifically that all living things are made of cells and every cell has a cell potential , biological electricity has the same chemical underpinnings as the current between electrochemical cells , and thus can be recapitulated in a way outside the body , Volta 's intuition was correct . Volta , essentially , objected to Galvaniâ s conclusions about `` animal electric fluid '' , but the two scientists disagreed respectfully and Volta coined the term `` galvanism '' for a direct current of electricity produced by chemical action . Thus , owing to an argument between the two in regard to the source or cause of the electricity , Volta built the first battery in order to specifically disprove his associate 's theory .

Lasi ( Sub divided into following casts `` Moondra '' , `` Jamot '' , `` Roonjha '' , `` Sheikh '' , `` Angaria '' and `` Burraf '' ) is a tribe settled in Lasbela District of Balochistan , Pakistan . The term Lasi is a geographical name , which is even applied to all the tribes other than Baloch and Brahvi , Med , Khoja and Hindus who are settled in Lasbela . The population of Lasbela presents many features of special interest to the ethnologist . The first historical reference to the ancient population of Lasbela and Makran is to be found in Arrian , who divides the population into two distinct classes . The people of the coast whom he names the Ichthyophagoi or fish-eaters and the population of the interior , the Arabi , the Oreitai and the Gadrosia of Gadrosia or Gedrosia . Several other authors have described the strange race of the Ichthyophagoi who are undoubtedly identifiable with the present fishermen of the coast . Afterwards , the district appears to have come under the influence of the Sammas , who asserted their independence when the power of the Abbaside caliphs declined . The Sumras gained a position of supremacy in the middle of the eleventh century . They were eventually overthrown by the Sammas under Jam Umar in 1333 . The Sammas reigned till 1523 when they were defeated and their power was completely broken by Shah Hussain Argon . The succeeding period is again obscure . The chiefs of the Gujar , Ranjha , Gunga and Burfat tribes , who are still to be found in Lasbela , are said to have exercised a semi-independent power previous to the rise of the Aliani family of the Jamoot tribe , to which the present Jam of Lasbela belongs . The principal Lasi tribes are only five in number , namely Jamot , Moondra , Roonjha , Sheikh , Angaria and Burraf . These are called the Panjraj or the five tribal confederacies . Under each Raj are a large number of heterogeneous groups .

Yu 's daughter , Yu Hyun-sun , was employed at the foreign ministry as a mid-level director through a special employment program . The Kosovo national football team represents Republic of Kosovo in international men 's football . Controlled by the Football Federation of Kosovo , the governing body for football in Kosovo , they are not a member of FIFA or UEFA . The Kosovo national football team was formed following the break-up of the former Yugoslavia , and has played a number of friendly matches . Most of these friendly matches were played against football clubs , although a number were played against national teams of other countries . The team is currently coached by Albert Bunjaku , who took charge in May 2009 . Kosovo has played a number of international matches . The last international match was a 1-0 win over Saudi Arabia , played in Ankara , Turkey , on June 15 , 2007 . It was the first time that Kosovo played a team that has taken part in the FIFA World Cup and the winning goal was scored by Kristian Nushi from the penalty spot on the 84th minute . The biggest win for Kosovo is the 7-1 defeat of Monaco , who hosted the event on April 24 , 2006 . The team that played against Monaco was led by the former Kosovo national team coach , Muharrem Sahiti , who after the match stated that : `` I am very pleased with the team 's performance even though we had predicted a stronger opponent . However , I want to emphasize that our players have been fantastic . The fact that we do not play many international matches may have inspired the players to give it their all this time '' . Previously , Kosovo played two matches against Albania and lost in both of them : 0-1 at home , and 3-1 away . In two other matches the Kosovo team played against Turkey , winning one and losing one : the first match was won by Kosovo 3-0 while the second was a 2-1 defeat , with both matches played in same stadium , but on different dates . The games against Turkey were , however , played with a team consisting of 34-35 year-old seniors . Turkey and Albania on the first match played with their B teams . In 2005 they participated to the KTFF 50th Anniversary Cup in Northern Cyprus , finishing second on three . They lost 1-0 against the host and won 4-1 against SÃ pmi . On February 17 , 2008 Kosovo declared independence from Serbia and sought international recognition . A number of states such as France , the United States and the United Kingdom immediately recognized the new state . Others , such as Serbia , Russia and Spain are fiercely opposed to independence . On May 6 , 2008 , Kosovo applied for FIFA membership . `` It 's an historical moment for our country . We hope to be accepted . '' , said Fadil Vokrri , president of the FFK . Kosovo 's applications was discussed at the FIFA Congress in Zurich , in October 2008 when Kosovo was rejected membership in FIFA and denied right to play any friendly matches as it was deemed it does not comply with article 10 of the FIFA statutes , that only `` an independent state recognized by the international community '' may be admitted into FIFA . The IOC has stated that Kosovo must be a member of the UN before it can enter the Olympics . Kosovo has so far only participated in one international tournament , the KTFF 50th Anniversary Cup , held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Northern Cyprus Football Federation . ) The following players were named for 2010 .
John IX was Pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 898 to 900 . Little is known about John IX before he became Pope . Born in Tivoli in an unknown year , he was ordained as a Benedictine priest by Pope Formosus . With the support of the powerful House of Spoleto he was elected Pontiff in early 898 following the sudden death of Pope Theodore II . With a view to diminish the violence of faction in Rome , John held several synods in Rome and elsewhere in 898 . They not only confirmed the judgment of Pope Theodore II in granting Christian burial to Pope Formosus , but also at a council held at Ravenna decreed that the records of the synod held by Pope Stephen VI which had condemned him should be burned . Re-ordinations were forbidden , and those of the clergy who had been degraded by Stephen were restored to the ranks from which he had deposed them . To keep their independence , which was threatened by the Germans , the Slavs of Moravia appealed to John to let them have a hierarchy of their own . Ignoring the complaints of the German hierarchy , John sanctioned the consecration of a metropolitan and three bishops for the Church of the Moravians . Finding that it was advisable to cement the ties between the empire and the papacy , John IX gave unhesitating support to Lambert in preference to Arnulf during the Synod of Rome , and also induced the council to determine that henceforth the consecration of the Popes should take place only in the presence of the imperial legates . The sudden death of Lambert shattered the hopes which this alliance seemed to promise . John IX died in the year 900 and was succeeded by Pope Benedict IV ( 900 â `` 903 ) .

Å 1\/2 eljko PetroviÄ ( Ð -- Ð Ñ Ð Ð 3\/4 Ð Ð Ñ Ñ Ð 3\/4 Ð Ð Ñ ) ( born 13 November 1965 in NikÅ iÄ , Montenegro , SFR Yugoslavia ) is a retired Montenegrin footballer and was the technical coach of Feyenoord Rotterdam in the 2004\/2005 season . He manages J. League Division 1 side Urawa Red Diamonds . PetroviÄ started his footballing career with BuduÄ nost Titograd in 1987 , spending 3 seasons there . A move to Dinamo Zagreb in the 1990\/1991 season confirmed his place as a talented rightback . He was chosen to represent the national team on 12 September 1990 in the match against Northern Ireland which his team won 2-0 . He signed for Sevilla FC in 1991 and played there alongside Diego Maradona . However , a markedly dry spell at the Spanish club indicated that he was surplus to requirements at the club and he was quick to sign for Dutch club FC Den Bosch in 1992 . He assisted the club to promotion to the Eredivisie and was eager to join RKC Waalwijk in 1994 . It was at this club which he excelled as an attacking right wingback where he scored 13 goals in total of 2 seasons before joining Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven in 1996 . In his first season at PSV , he showed that he could play well , getting his name in the scoresheet 5 times in the process . In his second season at the club , however , he proved a difficult player to manage and he was also involved in a spat with team captain Arthur Numan . As a result , he saw his first-team chances limited to just 10 appearances for that season . In 1997 he moved to Japan to play for Urawa Red Diamonds before returning to RKC Waalwijk in 2000 where he finished his playing career . He was a prominent member of FR Yugoslavia national team through World Cup qualifying process throughout 1996-1997 period , and also represented his country in France 98 . On 21 August 2006 PetroviÄ was appointed as the new head coach of Portuguese team Boavista FC . In his first match as manager , Boavista won 3-0 against Benfica .

Samson was a British hard rock band formed in 1977 by guitarist and vocalist Paul Samson . They are best known for their first three albums with future Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson , then known as `` Bruce Bruce '' , and drummer Thunderstick ( real name Barry Graham ) , who wore a leather mask and performed on stage in a metal cage . Drummer Clive Burr was also member of the band , both before and after his tenure with Iron Maiden . Drummer Mel Gaynor also had a successful music career being a member of Simple Minds for over 20 years . After the release of their debut album Survivors in 1979 , they spent the rest of the year touring on support of the album . In early 1980 , Samson appeared as the opening act for Robin Trower 's concerts , including dates at Hammersmith Odeon . The tour finished at Newcastle City Hall , where days later the band opened for Rainbow , on their Down to Earth tour . Here , Samson started performing for bigger audiences , but after some touring differences , they were canceled for the rest of the dates . The band 's second album , Head On , was released July 1980 , and peaked at # 34 in the UK Albums Chart The supporting tour was full of controversy and legal issues , due to problems with their management . They kept writing and rehearsing for a new record . Ten songs had already been composed , by October 1980 , and were ready to be recorded . At the same time , the band re-issued their debut album , Survivors , now with Dickinson handling vocal duties . The tour continued until the end of the year , when Samson entered the studio to record their third album , Shock Tactics . This was the last album Dickinson recorded with the band . Samson faced an innumerable amount of problems with their management . They were always being booked on ill-matched support tours . After leaving their management in 1981 they discovered that their record company was going bankrupt . Dickinson said they `` made every mistake in the business '' . His last performance with Samson was at the Reading Festival in 1981 . This was recorded by the BBC and released in 1990 , as the live album Live at Reading 1981 . The group posted three entries in the UK Singles Chart . These were `` Riding With The Angels ( 1981 , # 55 ) , `` Losing My Grip '' ( 1982 , # 63 ) and `` Red Skies ( 1983 , # 65 ) . The group effectively disbanded with Paul Samson 's death from cancer on 9 August 2002 . Bass player Chris Aylmer died on 9 January 2007 following a battle with throat cancer . He was reported to have been responsible for suggesting the band 's name . He assumed the role of bass player previously having been the band 's soundman . The band appeared in a short-movie Biceps of Steel in 1980 , directed by Julien Temple , which was intended as the B-film to a major feature produced and promoted by the record company . The film featured two music-video type sequences which form the 15 minute film . Though it has been largely forgotten , clips from it were seen in the movie The Incubus ( 1981 ) . However , in 2006 , Biceps of Steel re-surfaced on Bruce Dickinson 's Anthology DVD . Line-ups of Samson only . Similarly named or solo projects have been omitted . In late 1977 Paul Samson got in touch with an old band mate Bass player Stewart Cochrane and asked him to try out for a new band named Samson . The line up was to be a four piece with current bass player Chris Aylmer as second guitar to Paul . Only one gig was played in this set up ( The Nag 's Head PH at Rochester , Kent ) as a second guitar was n't needed for the Samson `` Sound '' and was very messy . Stewart Cochrane left and Joined an Avant Garde Jazz Rock Band named Spanish Fly , played with many famous Jazz Musicians nad finished his career as an Orchestra leader for Holland America Line and Windstar Sail Cruises .

Anna Anka ( born April 28 , 1971 ) is a Swedish-American who has worked as a model , actress and author and was married to Canadian singer Paul Anka . Anka is featured in the Swedish documentary series Svenska Hollywoodfruar ( Swedish Hollywood Wives ) , and is known for her political opinions . Anka was born in Poland . Her mother died when she was very young . At the age of three Anka was adopted by a Swedish couple named Ã berg living in Bjuv , Sweden . She moved to the United States in 1993 after placing eighth in the international Miss Hawaiian Tropic pageant . Anka became a professional model and six years later she was hired as the personal trainer of musician Paul Anka . In 2005 she had Anka 's son Ethan . In 2008 they married and in 2010 they divorced . Anka made a brief appearance in the American film Dumb and Dumber , credited as Anna Ã berg . She had two lines , both in Swedish : Hej allihopa ( `` Hi everyone '' ) and Hej dÃ ( `` Bye '' ) . She has also played minor roles in the films The Specialist and Drop Zone . Anka has released a workout\/training book called The 30-minute pregnancy workout book . In 2009 , Anka became known to a wider public in the television show Svenska Hollywoodfruar where she was one of three Swedish women who had moved to Hollywood The program , which was shown on Swedish TV3 , had the highest ratings ever , and set a new viewer-record for a program made by TV3 . On September 16 , 2009 , Anka was interviewed on Swedish news site , Newsmill , in an article called `` Jag vill bli en fÃ rebild fÃ r svenska kvinnor '' ( I want to be a role model for Swedish women '' ) . The article described Swedish fathers as `` tragic with their diaper changes and their equality '' and Swedish women in general as shabby , petty , unintelligent and having lost touch with their natural femininity . A resounding appeal was made for the choice of a housewife lifestyle like Anka 's own , and she affirmed her wish to become the role model that Sweden needed . In reality , as was soon found out and acknowledged by the publishers , the piece had been ghost-written by site editors after a phone talk with Anka in order to increase attention . The article received more than 100 000 hits , a first for Newsmill , and several responses , among others Nalin Pekgul .

MiÄ dzyrzec Podlaski ( ; Mezri ` tsh , , , , , , ) is a city in BiaÅ a Podlaska County , Lublin Voivodeship , Poland . The first official recognition of MiÄ dzyrzec Podlaski as a city occurred in the year 1477 . Since the sixteenth century it has had a large Jewish population . In 1795 , the city was occupied by Austria , belonging to the Duchy of Warsaw from 1809 until 1815 , when it became a member of the Congress Poland . In 1867 the city became a stop on the Polish railway . At the end of the 1930s approximately 12,000 people , or Â 3\/4 of the population , were Jewish . In 1939 , following the Invasion of Poland , Nazi created the MiÄ dzyrzec Podlaski Ghetto . On the seventeenth of July 1943 , that ghetto was liquidated . Fewer than 1 % of the Jewish population of the city survived the German occupation . Of the approximately 4,900 employed citizens of the city , ca . 36 % work in industrial fields , 19 % in trade markets , and 11 % in education . The unemployment rate in the city was 22 % in October 2005 . The town lies at the intersection of two important national roads : DK2 ( Poland 's main east-west connector ) and DK19 . In the future Expressway S19 will run just west of the town . A 6.6 k section of it already constructed as the town 's bypass road and opened in 2008 allows north-south traffic on DK19 road to avoid the town center .
A metropolitan area network ( MAN ) is a computer network that usually spans a city or a large campus . A MAN usually interconnects a number of local area networks ( LANs ) using a high-capacity backbone technology , such as fiber-optical links , and provides up-link services to wide area networks ( or WAN ) and the Internet . Authors Kenneth C. Laudon and Jane P. Laudon ( 2001 ) of Management Information Systems : Managing the Digital Firm 10th ed . define a metropolitan area network as : It can also be used in cable television . Some technologies used for this purpose are Asynchronous Transfer Mode ( ATM ) , FDDI , and SMDS . These technologies are in the process of being displaced by Ethernet-based connections ( e.g. , Metro Ethernet ) in most areas . MAN links between local area networks have been built without cables using either microwave , radio , or infra-red laser links . Most companies rent or lease circuits from common carriers due to the fact that laying long stretches of cable can be expensive . DQDB , Distributed Queue Dual Bus , is the metropolitan area network standard for data communication . It is specified in the IEEE 802.6 standard . Using DQDB , networks can be up to 20 miles ( 30 km ) long and operate at speeds of 34 to 155 Mbit\/s . Several notable networks started as MANs , such as the Internet peering points MAE-West , MAE-East , and the Sohonet media network .
In mathematics , a square number , sometimes also called a perfect square , is an integer that is the square of an integer ; in other words , it is the product of some integer with itself . So , for example , 9 is a square number , since it can be written as 3 3 . Square numbers are non-negative . Another way of saying that a ( non-negative ) number is a square number , is that its square root is again an integer . For example , â 9 = 3 , so 9 is a square number . A positive integer that has no perfect square divisors except 1 is called square-free . The usual notation for the formula for the square of a number n is not the product n n , but the equivalent exponentiation n2 , usually pronounced as `` n squared '' . For a non-negative integer n , the nth square number is n2 , with 02 = 0 being the zeroth square . The concept of square can be extended to some other number systems . If rational numbers are included , then a square is the ratio of two square integers , and , conversely , the ratio of two square integers is a square ( e.g. , 4\/9 = ( 2\/3 ) 2 ) . Starting with 1 , there are square numbers up to and including m. Also , it is possible to count up square numbers by adding together the last square , the last square 's root , and the current root . Mathematically expressed , The expression for the nth square number is n2 . This is also equal to the sum of the first n odd numbers as can be seen in the above pictures , where a square results from the previous one by adding an odd number of points ( shown in cyan ) . The formula follows : So for example , 52 = 25 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 . The nth square number can be calculated from the previous two by doubling the ( n 1 ) - th square , subtracting the ( n 2 ) - th square number , and adding 2 , because n2 = 2 ( n 1 ) 2 ( n 2 ) 2 + 2 . For example , 2 52 42 + 2 = 2 25 16 + 2 = 50 16 + 2 = 36 = 62 . A square number is also the sum of two consecutive triangular numbers . The sum of two consecutive square numbers is a centered square number . Every odd square is also a centered octagonal number . Another property of a square number is that the number of its divisor is odd , while other number have even number of divisors . An integer root is the only divisor that pairs up with itself to yield the number , while other divisors come in pairs . Lagrange 's four-square theorem states that any positive integer can be written as the sum of 4 or fewer perfect squares . Three squares are not sufficient for numbers of the form 4k ( 8m + 7 ) . A positive integer can be represented as a sum of two squares precisely if its prime factorization contains no odd powers of primes of the form 4k + 3 . This is generalized by Waring 's problem . In general , if a prime divides a number then also the square of that prime must divide the number , if it fails to divide it second time , the number is definitely not square . Every prime must divide the number even times . At certain point it is faster to run square root on the number than to test it for all primes up to 4th root of the number . Squarity testing can be used as alternative way in factorization of large numbers . Instead of testing for divisibility , just test for squarity : for given m and some number k , if kÂ - m is square of any number n then k - n divides m. For example 100 Â - 9991 is square of 3 , consequently 100 - 3 divides 9991 . This test is deterministic for odd divisors in range from k - n to k + n where k covers some range of natural numbers k â â m. A square number can not be a perfect number . Squares of even numbers are even , since ( 2n ) 2 = 4n2 . Squares of odd numbers are odd , since ( 2n + 1 ) 2 = 4 ( n2 + n ) + 1 . It follows that square roots of even square numbers are even , and square roots of odd square numbers are odd .
`` One Man Army '' ( often mistakenly called `` Falling '' ) is a 1999 song by Our Lady Peace , released as the first single from their third album , Happiness ... Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch . `` One Man Army is about the struggle for individuality . It 's about finding the courage to metaphorically strip naked and set fire to all your inhibitions . It 's about cleansing yourself of all the people and things that suffocate your individuality . '' ~ Raine Maida The release of the live version of `` One Man Army '' from their Woodstock 1999 performance forced the record label to release the single several weeks earlier than the planned date of August 4 . Columbia CSK 42454 SBME Import This music video was directed by Mark Kohr and was filmed in Toronto on August 5 , 1999 . It begins with lead singer Raine Maida sitting in a chair in what appears to be a hotel hallway . Using special effects , he stands up and walks away , but a second `` copy '' of him remains seated . The video is then split into two sets of scenes : In one set , the band is set up in the middle of a lobby and performs the song ; in the other scenes , Maida walks through a city . During the choruses of the song , Maida is suddenly pulled through the air ( apparently acting as gravity was pulling him ) , causing him to crash into several walls , and smash through a tree , a wall , and several windows . He tries holding onto a fire hydrant and a street sign , but is pulled away . At the end of the video , Raine sits down on a bench on a pier , but he is pulled away out over the water after trying to hold onto the bench . In 2000 , the video won another two MuchMusic Video Awards ( both are People 's Choice ) , Favourite Canadian Group and Favourite Canadian Video .

The Red-whiskered Bulbul ( Pycnonotus jocosus ) is a passerine bird found in Asia . It is a member of the bulbul family . It is a resident frugivore found mainly in tropical Asia . It has been introduced in many tropical areas of the world where populations have established themselves . It feeds on fruits and small insects and they conspicuously perch on trees and their calls are a loud three or four note call . The distinctive crest and the red-vent and whiskers makes them easy to identify . They are very common in hill forests and urban gardens within its range . The Red-whiskered Bulbul was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in 1758 in his Systema Naturae . He placed it along with the shrikes under Lanius . Local names include Turaha pigli-pitta in Telugu , Sipahi bulbul in Bengali , and Phari-bulbul or Kanera bulbu in Hindi . The Red-whiskered Bulbul is about 20 c in length . It has brown upper-parts and whitish underparts with buff flanks and a dark spur running onto the breast at shoulder level . It has a tall pointed black crest , red face patch and thin black moustachial line . The tail is long and brown with white terminal feather tips , but the vent area is red . The loud and evocative call is a sharp kink-a-joo ( also transcribed as pettigrew or kick-pettigrew or pleased to meet you ) and the song is a scolding chatter . It is more often heard than seen , but will often perch conspicuously especially in the mornings when they call from the tops of trees . The life span is about 11 years . Hybrids have been noted in captivity with Pycnonotus cafer , Pycnonotus leucotis , Pycnonotus xanthopygos , Pycnonotus melanicterus and Pycnonotus leucogenys and leucism has been recorded . Several avian malaria parasites have been described from the species . This is a bird of lightly wooded areas , more open country with bushes and shrubs , and farmland . Irruptions have been noted from early times with Thomas C. Jerdon noting that they `` periodically visiting Madras and other wooded towns in large flocks . '' It has established itself in Australia , Los Angeles , Hawaii , and Florida in the United States , and in the Mauritius , Assumption Island and Mascarene Islands . In Florida , it is only found in a small area , and its population could be extirpated easily . The Red-whiskered Bulbul was introduced by the Zoological and Acclimatization Society in 1880 to Sydney , and became well established across the suburbs by 1920 , and continued to spread slowly to around 100 km away . It is now also found in suburban Melbourne and Adelaide , although it is unclear how they got there . The Red-whiskered Bulbul feeds on fruits ( including those of Thevetia peruviana that are toxic to mammals ) , nectar and insects . The breeding season is spread out and peaks from December to May in southern India and March to October in northern India . Breeding may occur once or twice a year . The courtship display of the male involves head bowing , spreading the tail and drooping wings . The nest is cup-shaped , and is built on bushes , thatched walls or small trees . It is woven of fine twigs , roots , and grasses , and embellished with large objects such as bark strips , paper , or plastic bags . Clutches typically contain two to three eggs . Adults ( possibly the female ) may feign injury to distract potential predators away from the nest . The eggs have a pale mauve ground color with speckles becoming blotches towards the broad end . Eggs measure 21 mm and are 16 mm wide . Eggs take 12 days to hatch . Both parents take part in raising the young . Young birds are fed on caterpillars and insects which are replaced by fruits and berries as they mature . The chicks are psilopaedic ( having down only in the pterylae ) . Eggs and chicks may be preyed on by the Greater Coucal , Calotes versicolor , and crows . They defend territories of about 0.3 ha ( 0.75 acres ) during the breeding season . They roost communally in loose groups of hundred or more birds . On the island of RÃ union , this species established itself and also aided the spread of alien plant species such as Rubus alceifolius . In Florida they feed on fruits and berries of as many as 24 exotic plants including loquat ( Eriobotrya japonica ) , Lantana spp . , Brazilian pepper ( Schinus terebinthifolius ) and figs ( Ficus ) . Populations on the island of Reunion have also diversified within thirty years according to their food resources with visible variations in bill morphology . This species was once a popular cagebird in parts of India . C. W. Smith noted in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal ( volume X. p. 640 ) that These birds are in great request among the natives , being of a fearless disposition , and easily reclaimed . They are taught to sit on the hand , and numbers may thus be seen in any Indian bazaar . The species continues to be a popular cagebird in parts of Southeast Asia .
Nivelles is a Walloon city and municipality located in the Belgian province of Walloon Brabant . The Nivelles municipality includes the old communes of Baulers , Bornival , Thines , and Monstreux . The Nivelles district includes all the municipalities in Walloon Brabant . Its Collegiate Church of Saint Gertrude has been classified as a Major Heritage of Wallonia . Starting in 4000 BC , the Nivelles was gradually turned into agricultural land by the Danubian settlers . Most of their ancestral Rubanean civilization was destroyed by the Roman invaders during the first century AD . In their turn , most of the Roman constructions , including villas , were destroyed during the Germanic invasions of the 3rd century . In the 7th century , the territory was part of the Austrasian Frankish kingdom , and the Mayor of the Palace , Pippin of Landen , rebuilt a villa here which covered more than 78 kmÂ . After Pippin 's death in 640 , the bishop of Maastricht , the future Saint Amand , urged Pippin 's widow , Itta , to found an abbey in their villa . Itta 's daughter , Gertrude , became the monastery 's first abbess and was venerated as a saint upon her death . The growing influx of pilgrims necessitated the construction of ever-bigger churches , which culminated in the huge Romanesque structure that we can still admire today . The dedication of the church took place in 1046 in the presence of Wazo , Prince-Bishop of LiÃ ge , and Henry III , Holy Roman Emperor . This was the golden age of the Nivelles monastery , that now owned territories as far as Friesland , the Moselle and the Rhine . In the 13th century , the city that grew around the church became part of the Duchy of Brabant . The population was mostly made up of artisans and guild members , who did not hesitate to fight the abbesses and the dukes to obtain their rights . These rights were finally granted by Joanna , Duchess of Brabant in the 14th century . In 1647 , an important uprising by the thread manufacturers resulted in many of the city 's entrepreneurs leaving for France , leading to the city 's economic decline . The wars of the 17th century between France and the Spanish Netherlands made the situation worse as Nivelles went through successive sieges and military occupations . The Austrian and French regimes of the 18th century brought religious and administrative reforms to the city . In 1830 , Nivelles was one of the first cities to send patriotic troops to Brussels to fight in the Belgian Revolution . The following years were marked by the growth of heavy industry , including metallurgy and railway construction . World War I brought some damage to the city . World War II , however , was a lot worse : on May 14 , 1940 , the entire city center was destroyed , leaving only the walls of the collegiate church standing . The rebuilding of the church was completed in 1984 . In and , the Belgian Grand Prix of Formula One was hosted at the circuit Nivelles-Baulers . Emerson Fittipaldi won the race both times . Today , the circuit has been reconverted into an industrial zone . In September 2007 , Nivelles jointly hosted the VII European Handball Championship of Ballpelote , International fronton and International game with Buizingen .

The Eastern Hemisphere , also Eastern hemisphere or eastern hemisphere , is a geographical term for the half of the Earth that is east of the Prime Meridian ( which crosses Greenwich , England , United Kingdom ) and west of 180 Â longitude . It is also used to refer to Europe , Asia , Africa , and Australasia , vis - Ã - vis the Western Hemisphere , which includes the Americas . In addition , it may be used in a cultural or geopolitical sense as a synonym for ` Old World ' . The line demarcating the eastern and western hemispheres is an arbitrary convention , unlike the equator ( an imaginary line encircling the Earth , equidistant from its poles ) which divides the northern and southern hemispheres . The Prime Meridian at 0 Â longitude and the International Date Line , around 180 Â longitude are the conventionally accepted boundaries , since they divide eastern longitudes from western longitudes . Using this demarcation puts portions of western Europe , Africa and eastern Russia in the western hemisphere , thereby diluting its usefulness for cartography , as well as for geopolitical constructs , since all of Eurasia and Africa are typically included in the eastern hemisphere . Consequently , the meridians of 20 Â W and the diametrically opposed 160 Â E are often used , which includes all of the European and African mainlands , but also includes a small portion of northeast Greenland ( typically reckoned as part of North America ) and excludes more of eastern Russia and Oceania ( e.g. , New Zealand ) . The two major regions of Antarctica are named after their positions mainly within a single hemisphere ; East Antarctica is named after the Eastern Hemisphere . The mainland of the Eastern Hemisphere is larger than that of the Western Hemisphere ( Americas ) and has a wide variety of habitats .

The Pakenham railway line in Melbourne , Australia is the suburban electrified portion of the railway to Bairnsdale in eastern Gippsland . In addition to suburban electric trains , it carries diesel passenger trains and freight trains to Gippsland . The Pakenham line traverses mainly flat country with few curves and fairly minimal earthworks for most of the line . However between South Yarra and Malvern the line has been lowered into a cutting to eliminate level crossings , and between Malvern and Caulfield it has been raised on an embankment for the same reason . Also , it encounters some gentle hills between Narre Warren and Beaconsfield which require some more extensive earthworks to negotiate . After Caulfield , the line has numerous level crossings , as well as some bridges over and under roads . Most of the line goes through built-up suburbs and some industrial areas , but after Dandenong , it gets into more open countryside , passing by open fields and farms , particularly after Beaconsfield . This outer portion of the line is one of Melbourne 's main growth corridors , which is rapidly replacing the farms with houses and adding many new riders to the line each year . The Pakenham line branches from the Lilydale line at Richmond and shares four tracks with the Frankston line to Caulfield , running next to the Sandringham line as far as South Yarra . From Caulfield the rest of the line is double track , with three platforms at Oakleigh and Dandenong . Although there are plans to add a third track on some sections between Caulfield and Dandenong as part of the Dandenong railway line triplication project . Automatic block signalling is provided throughout . Intermediate terminating facilities are provided at Caulfield , Oakleigh , Westall , Springvale , Dandenong , Narre Warren and Berwick . Stabling sidings for suburban trains are provided at Caulfield , Oakleigh , Westall , Dandenong , and Pakenham , although those at Caulfield and Oakleigh are not normally used . Westall is also the location of a suburban train maintenance workshop . The Pakenham line began as part of the main line to Gippsland , but at the time the route through the suburbs has not been determined , so the first portion to open was the section between Oakleigh and Bunyip ( Gippsland ) in October 1877 . Oakleigh was connected to the city at South Yarra in April 1879 . The section from South Yarra to Hawksburn was duplicated from opening , and duplication was extended to Caulfield in 1881 , Oakleigh in 1883 , and Dandenong in 1891 . In 1915 the line from South Yarra to Caulfield was quadrupled , and it was possibly at the same time that this section of the line was lowered into a cutting to eliminate numerous level crossings . Power signalling was provided between Richmond and Hawksburn at the same time , then on to Caulfield in 1921 . Electrification of the line to Dandenong occurred in two stages in 1922 . Power signalling was extended to Carnegie in 1933 and Oakleigh in 1940 . In 1954 the line beyond Dandenong was electrified mainly because of the expected briquette traffic from the brown coal mines in the Latrobe Valley , and over the next two years most of the line between Dandenong and Pakenham was duplicated and provided with power signalling , although Narre Warren to Berwick was not done until 1962 . Oakleigh to Dandenong was converted to power signalling in stages from 1970 to 1972 . In 1975 , suburban services were extended beyond Dandenong to Pakenham , which until then had only been served by the passenger trains connecting Gippsland to Melbourne . In 2002 , General Motors station closed and all trains ran express between Hallam and Dandenong . On 1 March 2007 , with the abolition of Zone 3 , Pakenham was re-zoned to Zone 2 in the Melbourne Metropolitan rail system . This brought the cost of train fares down , improving accessibility to the public . Weekday services generally run every 30 minutes , with more frequent services during peak periods . Some weekday peak period services stop at selected stations only between Dandenong and South Yarra . Other services stop all suburban stations . On weekends services generally run every 40 minutes and stop all suburban stations except Flagstaff . V\/Line services to and from Gippsland are available to Pakenham customers , which stop only at major suburban stations . Bold stations are termini , where some train services terminate ; italic stations are staffed ; and stations with an asterisk ( \* ) are manned only during morning peak . Branches from the City Loop at Flinders St and Parliament .
-- Bangkok ; Wattanaseuksa , BE 2544 , p. 26 ) Lopburi ( ( Pronunciation ) ) is the capital city of Lopburi Province in Thailand . It is located about 150 km north-east of Bangkok . As of 2006 it has a population of 26,500 . The town ( thesaban mueang ) covers the whole tambon Tha Hin and parts of Thale Chup Son of Mueang Lopburi district , a total area of 6.85 kmÂ . The city has a long history , dating back to the Dvaravati period more than 1000 years ago . According to the Northern Chronicles , it was founded by King Kalavarnadish , who came from Taxila ( Takkasila ) in Northwest India ( now Pakistan ) in 648 AD . It was originally known as Lavo or Lavapura , meaning `` city of Lava '' in reference to the ancient South Asian city of Lavapuri ( present-day Lahore ) . Lopburi was under the rising Angkor regime and became one of the most important centers in the Chao Phraya Basin from then on . Lop Buri ( Lavo ) is described in Book III of Marco Poloâ s Travels , where it is called Locach . This came from the Chinese ( Cantonese ) pronunciation of Lavo , â Lo-huk â ( ç 3\/4 æ -- ) . The city is referred to as â Lo-ho â ( ç 3\/4 æ -- ) in chapter 20 of the History of Yuan ( å å : YuÃ n ShÇ ) , the official history of the Mongol , or Yuan Dynasty of China . Due to a scribal error in Book III of Marco Poloâ s travels treating of the route southward from Champa , where the name Java was substituted for Champa as the point of departure , Java Minor was located 1,300 miles to the south of Java Major , instead of from Champa , on or near an extension of the Terra Australis . As explained by Sir Henry Yule , the editor of an English edition of Marco Poloâ s Travels : â Some geographers of the 16th century , following the old editions which carried the travellers south-east of Java to the land of Boeach ( or Locac ) , introduced in their maps a continent in that situationâ . After the foundation of Ayutthaya Kingdom in the fifteenth century , Lopburi was a stronghold of Ayutthaya 's rulers . It later became a new royal capital during the reign of King Narai the Great of the Ayutthaya kingdom in the middle of the 17th century , The king stayed here for about eight months a year . Today the city is most famous for the hundreds of Crab-Eating Macaques ( Macaca fascicularis ) that live in the middle of the city , especially around the Khmer temple , Prang Sam Yot , and a Khmer shrine , Sarn Phra Karn . They are fed by the local people , especially during the Monkey Festival in November . Because they are not afraid of humans , they steal whatever food they can find from unwary diners . Prang Sam Yot , originally a Hindu shrine , has three prangs that represent Brahma , Vishnu , and Shiva ( the Hindu trinity ) . It was later converted to a Buddhist shrine .

A flexible-fuel vehicle model is also on offer under the label `` MultiFuel '' , featuring the 1.6 MPI E85 102 bhp engine . The SEAT CÃ rdoba was the saloon , estate and coupÃ version of the supermini SEAT Ibiza , built by Spanish automaker SEAT from 1993 to 2009 . SEAT 's official rally car from 1998 to 2000 was based on the CÃ rdoba ( the SEAT CÃ rdoba WRC ) , and featured a 2.0 L turbocharged engine . The first generation SEAT CÃ rdoba was presented at the 1993 Frankfurt Motor Show and launched in the summer of the same year , penned by Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro and based on the chassis of the SEAT Ibiza Mk2 which would spawn the Volkswagen Polo Mk3 the following year . Its 1.4 , 1.6 , 1.8 and 2.0-litre petrol engines were also found in the Volkswagen Polo and Ibiza , as was the 1.9 TDI . Though based on the Polo and Ibiza , its extended rear overhang meant its length was close to a Golf but still smaller than the Jetta . In 1996 the CÃ rdoba range was extended to an estate ( CÃ rdoba Vario ) and a coupÃ ( CÃ rdoba SX ) . The CÃ rdoba SX was a two-door coupÃ version of the CÃ rdoba . It came in four variants . A 1.6 100 b , 1.9 TD , 2.0 8V ( Cupra ) which has the same engine as the CÃ rdoba GTi and a 2.0 16v . The 16v 150 b ABF engine is identical to the engine found in the Mk3 Golf GTi . The 16v SX also came with 16 '' multispoke alloys , 280 m front discs , ABS , traction control and air conditioning as standard . The model was slightly revised in 1998 with a new rear splitter which required the exhaust to be hidden , a revised front lower grill and splitter and leather interior became standard . The CÃ rdoba 16v was Â # 1000GBP more expensive at list and 1 second slower 0-60 because of the added weight of the rear end . In 1999 the CÃ rdoba was face lifted with changes focusing on the bumpers , headlights , taillights and front grille as well as in the interior , with new materials and upholstery . In the engines the 16v ABF engine was replaced with a 1.8 156 b Turbo engine and joined the Cupra range . Right hand drive versions in Ireland received only the 100 b 1.6 8v model . The SX was no longer available in the UK . The CÃ rdoba WRC competed in the top category of the World Rally Championship officially between 1998 and 2000 , as SEAT had homologated a World Rally Car version of the CÃ rdoba 16v for competition in the FIA World Rally Championship and other international rallies . 1994 World Drivers ' Champion Didier Auriol , of France , and Toni Gardemeister and Harri Rovanpera , both of Finland , were among those to pilot the factory cars . Debuting at the 1998 Rally Finland with Rovanpera , and with podiums achieved at the 1999 Rally New Zealand ( Gardemeister ) , the 1999 Rally of Great Britain ( Rovanpera ) as well as the 2000 Safari Rally ( Auriol ) , the works program concluded at the end of the 2000 season with the third evolution of the CÃ rdoba WRC race car . However the SEAT CÃ rdoba WRC continued to compete with successful results in national championships in different countries . In Spain , the CÃ rdoba won the national title of all the rallies on gravel with Pedro Diego and Marc BlÃ zquez , plus wins in tarmac rallies with Salvador CaÃ ellas Jr. The contemporary Volkswagen Polo Classic ( saloon ) and Variant ( estate ) were in fact rebadged versions of the SEAT CÃ rdoba Mk1 and CÃ rdoba Vario models respectively , and not based on the Polo Classic\/Volkswagen Polo hatchback . FAW-Volkswagen , VW 's Chinese subsidiary assembled and sold the CÃ rdoba Mk1 under the VW Citi-Golf name in 1996 . The Citi-Golf had the CÃ rdoba rear and front design not the European \/ South American versions which helped distinguish the CÃ rdoba from the Polo Classic\/Derby models . In Mexico it was rebadged as the Volkswagen Derby . In 1995 it was imported from Spain , but the 1996 model was assembled in the Volkswagen de MÃ xico assembly plant in Puebla , Mexico . In 1998 the Spanish made Polo Classic\/Volkswagen Polo Classic was introduced in Mexico as the new Volkswagen Derby . The second generation of the CÃ rdoba is the four-door saloon version of the hatchback SEAT Ibiza Mk3 ; no estate or coupÃ versions though were built in this generation . The SEAT CÃ rdoba Mk2 also shares its chassis and engines with the Volkswagen Polo Mk4 and Å koda Fabia Mk1 & Mk2 : straight-3 12-valve 1.2-litre petrols , straight-4 16-valve 1.4 and 1.6-litre petrols , a straight-4 8-valve 2.0-litre petrol , a straight-3 1.4 litre TDI turbodiesel , a 1.9-litre SDI and a 1.9-litre TDI turbodiesel in 100 b and 130 b variants . As of February 2009 , the SEAT CÃ rdoba was available with the following engines : 1.6 , 1.4 and 1.2 petrol , 1.9 and 1.4 diesel . In Mexico , CÃ rdoba production continues in the Volkswagen de MÃ xico Puebla assembly plant . It has the VW 4-cylinder , 2.0-litre . 115 b engine combined with a 5-speed manual or an optional 6-speed Tiptronic transmission .

Catarrhini is one of the two subdivisions of the higher primates ( the other being the New World monkeys ) . It contains the Old World monkeys and the apes , which in turn are further divided into the lesser apes or gibbons and the great apes , consisting of the orangutans , gorillas , chimpanzees , bonobos , and humans . They are all native to Africa and Asia . The name Catarrhini means drooping nose or downward nosed , and refers to their narrow , downward pointing nostrils , in contrast with the outward pointing nostrils of the New World monkeys ( Platyrrhini ) . Like the platyrrhines ( with the exception of the genus Aotus ) , the catarrhines are diurnal . Apes do not have tails . The tails of Old World Monkeys are not prehensile , but serve as balancing organs . Catarrhines have flat finger - and toenails . They have prehensile ( grasping ) hands , and all but humans also have prehensile feet . Their dental formula is . Most species show considerable sexual dimorphism and do not form a pair bond . Most , but not all , species live in social groups . The apes and Old World monkeys split from their New World monkey kin about 35 million years ago . The major catarrhine division occurred about 25 mya , with the gibbons separating from the great apes ( including humans ) about 15-19 mya . In May 2005 , three new primate fossils were discovered in the Bugti Hills of Pakistan . These hills lock away many primate mysteries . One of these mysteries was uncovered in 2001 , when the early primate Bugtilemur was discovered and led to the assumption that lemurs came from Asia , not Africa . The three primates called Bugtipithecus inexpectans , Phileosimias kamali , and Phileosimias brahuiorum all date back to the Oligocene some 30 million years ago - when monkeys dominated only Africa . These were small lemur-like catarrhines that prospered in an ancient tropical rainforest . Possibly these Asian catarrhines led nowhere in evolution , a side branch from Eosimias . Other possible new catarrhines fossils have been uncovered in China , Thailand , and Burma .
In 2011 , Japanese sake makers started producing similar products , attempting to promote them under the name ` makkori ( ã ã ã ã ) ' , the Japanese pronunciation of makgeolli . Sadri is a branch of Prakrit language and is regarded as a sister language of Oriya , Bengali and Angika . It is spoken in the Indian states of Jharkhand , Orissa and the north of West Bengal , and in Bangladesh . Speakers of Sadri also use Hindi , Oriya , and Bengali . Population includes 1,381,000 Sadani , 574,000 Nagpuri , and 165,683 Oraon ( as of 1997 ) . Also spoken by the Chero tribe as first language . Sadri has become a lingua franca of jharkhandi societies . Besides speaking their own mother tongue Oraon , Munda , Kharia communities speak in Sadri with each other in many part of jharkhand , Orissa , Chhattisgarh , North Bengal , Assam , Andaman and Nicobar and other part of India , where Jharkhandi community resides . There are many variation of Sadri . The resident of Biru region ( former princely state ) in Gumla district of Jharkhand speak it as their first language though they have their own language . Even Oraon , Munda and Kharia of Orissa speak it as their first language . Though , standardization of Sadri is still to be done , a lot of literature have been written in the language . Many Sadri magazien were published in Many parts of India . Gharaiya Guith a monthly Sadri monthly magazine is published from Shillong . Johar Sahiya is being published from Ranchi . Veer Birsa , Aguwa , Nawa Parha , Adivasi Express were published from Dooars and Tarai region of West Bengal . A few feature film have also been produced in Sadri language in Assam , Dooars , Jharkhand and in Orissa . Since 1980 a lot of Sadri songs and video film have been produced . A variation of Sadri is Nagpuri , which is being taught in Ranchi and other university of Jharkhand .
A royal charter is a formal document issued by a monarch as a letter patent , granting a right or power to an individual or a body corporate . They were , and are still , used to establish significant organizations such as cities or universities . Charters should be distinguished from warrants and letters of appointment , as they have perpetual effect . Typically , a royal charter is produced as a high-quality work of calligraphy . Charters have been used in Europe since mediÃ val times to create cities ( i.e. , localities with recognized legal rights and privileges ) . The date that such a charter was granted is considered to be when a city was `` founded '' , regardless of when the locality originally began to be settled . At one time a royal charter was the only way in which an incorporated body could be formed , but other means ( such as the registration process for limited companies ) are generally now used instead . Among the past and present groups formed by royal charter are the British East India Company , the Hudson 's Bay Company , the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company ( P&O ) , the British South Africa Company , and some of the former British colonies on the North American mainland . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution_of_Engineers The royal decree is the equivalent in Belgium of a Royal Charter . In the period before 1958 , 32 higher education institutes had been by royal charter : these were typically engineering or technical institutions rather than universities . A Royal Charter is granted by Order-in-Council , either creating an incorporated body , or giving an existent one special status . This is an exercise of the Royal Prerogative , and , in Canada , there are hundreds of organizations under Royal Charters . Such organizations include charities , businesses , colleges , universities , and cities . Today , it is mostly charities and professional institutions who receive Royal Charters . Application for a charter is a petition to the Queen-in-Council . To receive a Royal Charter , the organization must have corporate members who have at least first degree level in a relevant field , consist of 5,000 members or more , be financially sound , and it must be in the public interest to regulate the institution under a charter . However , meeting these benchmarks does not guarantee the issuance of a Royal Charter . Cities under Royal Charter are not subject to municipal Acts of parliament applied generally to other municipalities , and instead are governed by legislation applicable to each city individually . The Royal Charter codifies the laws applied to the particular city , and lays out the powers and responsibilities not given to other municipalities in the province concerned . A number of Canadian universities and colleges were founded under Royal Charter . A number of Irish institutions still have a `` Royal '' prefix , even though the country has been a republic since 1949 . The University of South Africa received a Royal Charter in 1877 . Among the 750 or so organizations with Royal Charters are cities ; the Bank of England ; the BBC ; theaters such as the Royal Opera House and the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane ; Livery Companies ; universities ( mostly those founded before 1993 ) ; professional institutions , such as the Institution of Royal Engineers and charities . A Royal Charter is the manner in which a British town is raised to the rank of city . Most recently Inverness , Brighton & Hove and Wolverhampton were given their charters to celebrate the millennium , and Preston , Stirling , Newport , Lisburn and Newry to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2002 . Most British universities operate under Royal Charters , which give them the power to grant degrees . The most recent generation of UK universities were granted the power to grant degrees by the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 instead of by Royal Charter , while some other universities operate under Acts of Parliament . The University of Buckingham and BPP University College are the only private education institutions that have received a royal charter . The BBC operates under a Royal Charter which lasts for a limited period of ten years , after which it is renewed . Most Royal Charters are now granted to professional institutions and to charities . For example , the six accountancy institutes which make up the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies each have a Royal Charter which allows their members to call themselves Chartered Accountants . A Charter is not necessary for them to operate , but one is often sought as a recognition of `` pre-eminence , stability and permanence '' . A Royal Charter changes a body from a collection of individuals into a single legal entity . Once incorporated by Royal Charter , amendments to the Charter and by-laws require government approval . Although several American universities which predate the American Revolution purport to hold royal charters , in a number of cases they were in fact created by a grant from a local authority such as a colonial legislature .
A lagoon is a body of shallow sea water or brackish water separated from the sea by some form of barrier . The body of comparatively shallow salt or brackish water is separated from the deeper sea by a shallow or exposed barrier beach , sandbank of marine origin , coral reef , or similar feature . Thus , the enclosed body of water behind a barrier reef or barrier islands or enclosed by an atoll reef is called a lagoon . When used within this context of a distinctive portion of coral reef ecosystems , the term `` lagoon '' is synonymous with the term `` back reef '' or `` backreef '' , which is more commonly used by coral reef scientists to refer to the same area . These applications of lagoon in English dates from 1769 . It adapted and extended the sense of the Venetian laguna ( cf Latin lacuna , â empty spaceâ ) , which specifically referred to Veniceâ s shallow , island-studded stretch of saltwater , protected from the Adriatic by the barrier beaches of the Lido ( see Venetian Lagoon ) . Lagoon refers to both coastal lagoons formed by the build-up of sandbanks or reefs along shallow coastal waters , and the lagoons in atolls , formed by the growth of coral reefs on slowly sinking central islands . Lagoons that are fed by freshwater streams are also called estuaries . Many lagoons do not include `` lagoon '' in their common names . Albemarle Sound in North Carolina , Great South Bay , between Long Island and the barrier beaches of Fire Island in New York ; Isle of Wight Bay , which separates Ocean City , Maryland from the rest of Worcester County , Maryland ; Banana River in Florida ; and Lake Illawarra in New South Wales are all lagoons , despite their names . In the UK there are lagoons at Montrose Basin , ( Scotland ) and Broad Water near Tywyn , ( Wales ) , whilst the expanse of water inside Chesil Beach , England , known as The Fleet , could also be described as a lagoon . There is also one near the small town of Dingle in Western Ireland . Some of the famous lagoons in India are the Chilika Lake in Orissa , near Puri , and the Vembanad Lake in Kerala . Both are connected to the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea respectively through a narrow channel . Some other known lagoons like in Africa , include the Lagos Lagoon which empties itself into the Gulf of Guinea and the South Atlantic Ocean ( Keta Lagoon in Ghana . The world 's largest lagoon is located in New Caledonia . In Latin America often the use of â lagunaâ , which lagoon translates to , is used to describe a lake , such as Laguna Catemaco .

Niacin is found in variety of foods , including liver , chicken , beef , fish , cereal , peanuts and legumes , and is also synthesized from tryptophan , which is found in meat , dairy and eggs . In geometry , an octagon ( from the Greek okto , eight ) is a polygon that has eight sides . A regular octagon is represented by the SchlÃ fli symbol . A regular octagon is a closed figure with sides of the same length and internal angles of the same size . It has eight lines of reflective symmetry and rotational symmetry of order 8 . The internal angle at each vertex of a regular octagon is 135 Â and the sum of all the internal angles is 1080 Â ( as for any octagon ) . The area of a regular octagon of side length a is given by These last two coefficients bracket the value of pi , the area of the unit circle . where S is the span of the octagon , or the second shortest diagonal ; and a is the length of one of the sides , or bases . This is easily proven if one takes an octagon , draws a square around the outside ( making sure that four of the eight sides touch the four sides of the square ) and then taking the corner triangles ( these are 45-45-90 triangles ) and placing them with right angles pointed inward , forming a square . The edges of this square are each the length of the base .
Stanislav `` Stan '' Mikita ( born Stanislav Guoth on May 20 , 1940 ) , known colloquially as `` Stosh '' , is a Slovak-born Canadian retired professional ice hockey player , generally regarded as the best center of the 1960s . In 1961 he won the Stanley Cup with the Chicago Black Hawks , with whom he played his entire career . Mikita was born in SokolÄ e , Slovak Republic as Stanislav Guoth , but moved to St. Catharines , Ontario , as a young boy to escape Communist controlled Czechoslovakia . He was adopted by his aunt and uncle who gave him their surname , Mikita . After three starring junior seasons with the St. Catharines Teepees of the Ontario Hockey Association , Mikita was promoted to the parent Chicago Black Hawks in 1959 . In his second full year , in 1961 , the Hawks won their third Stanley Cup . The young center led the entire league in goals during the playoffs , scoring a total of six . The following season was his breakout year . Stan Mikita became a star as center of the famed `` Scooter Line '' , ( with right wing Ken Wharram and left wingers Ab McDonald and Doug Mohns ) . He became the most-feared center of the Sixties . With superstar teammate Bobby Hull , the Black Hawks had the most powerful offense of the decade , generally leading the league in goals scored . Combining skilled defense and a reputation as one of the game 's best faceoff men using his innovative curved stick , Mikita led the league in scoring four times in the decade , tying Bobby Hull 's single-season scoring mark in 1966 â `` 67 with 97 points ( a mark broken two years later by former teammate Phil Esposito and currently held by Wayne Gretzky ) . In his early years , Mikita was among the most penalized players in the league , but he then decided to play a cleaner game and went on to win the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for sportsmanlike conduct twice . Mikita 's drastic change in behavior came after he returned home from a road trip . His wife told him that while their daughter was watching the Black Hawks ' last road game on television , she turned and said , `` Mommy , why does Daddy spend so much time sitting down ? '' The camera had just shown Mikita in the penalty box again ( from Mikita 's autobiography `` I Play to Win . '' ) His latter years marred by chronic back injuries , Mikita finally retired during the 1979 â `` 80 season . Upon his retirement , he had the third-highest career scoring point total of any NHL player , after Gordie Howe and Phil Esposito . Mikita had played in the seventh most games of any player at the time . Mikita was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1983 , and into the Slovak Hockey Hall of Fame in 2002 . He currently serves as an ambassador of good will for the Blackhawks ' organization .

StÃ phane Henchoz ( born 7 September 1974 in Billens ) is a former Swiss international footballer who last played for Blackburn Rovers as a defender . He has been capped 72 times and played for his country at Euro 1996 and Euro 2004 . Henchoz first came to notice playing in the German Bundesliga for Hamburger SV . After signing for Blackburn Rovers in 1997 , Henchoz enjoyed two personally successful seasons in a relatively underperforming Rovers team . As Blackburn were relegated at the end of the 1998 â `` 99 season , Henchoz remained a Premiership player after being purchased for 3.5 million pounds by Liverpool . At Liverpool , Henchoz became a regular member of the first team during his five-and-a-half year stay at Anfield . Henchoz proved to be an inspirational signing and was popular with the Liverpool fans . He formed an effective central defensive partnership with Sami HyypiÃ . This partnership played an important part in Liverpool 's historic cup treble in 2001 , although it was Henchoz 's handball in the 90th minute of the League Cup Final against Birmingham City that led to extra time ( the match itself was only settled on penalties ) . Henchoz also famously blocked a goalbound Thierry Henry shot with his arm in the 17th minute of that year 's FA Cup Final , contributing to Liverpool 's victory in the match . His last two seasons were interrupted due to spells of injury but he still surpassed the 200 mark of games for Liverpool in 2003 â `` 04 . With injury problems and Gerard Houllier preferring Igor BiÅ Ä an at center half , Henchoz became something of a bit part player appearing as an occasional right back . Eventually , the Henchoz-Hyypi Ã partnership was rekindled in 2003 â `` 04 , helping Liverpool to fourth place in the league . When Rafael BenÃ tez replaced GÃ rard Houllier as manager , his decision to try versatile English defender Jamie Carragher in partnership with HyypiÃ spelled an end to Henchoz 's Anfield career . Carragher , previously employed as a full-back , was a revelation at center back and Henchoz consequently joined Celtic for free on a six-month contract . However , upon the expiration of that contract , Henchoz opted to move back to the Premiership with newly promoted Wigan Athletic . Whilst at Wigan he started in the 2006 Football League Cup Final . Henchoz left Wigan after only a year , signing a contract until the end of the 2006 â `` 07 season back with Blackburn Rovers . He was used sparingly during the season to fill in for injuries , but performed suitably . His second spell at Blackburn Rovers came to an end on May 19 , when he was released by Mark Hughes . He was reported of ending his career on 13 October 2008 , he now intends to study for his coaching badge . Henchoz played for Switzerland in UEFA Euro 1996 and UEFA Euro 2004 . He was expected to play in the FIFA World Cup 2006 , but due to health problems he retired on 31 March 2006 .
In Mexican cuisine , pico de gallo ( , rooster 's beak ) , also called salsa fresca , is a fresh , uncooked condiment made from chopped tomato , onion , and sometimes chilis ( typically jalapeÃ os or serranos ) . Other ingredients may also be added , such as lemon or lime juice , fresh cilantro ( coriander leaf ) , cucumber , radish or firm fruit such as mango . Pico de gallo can be used in much the same way as other Mexican salsas , Kenyan Kachumbari or Indian chutneys , but since it contains less liquid , it can also be used as a main ingredient in dishes such as tacos and fajitas . In some regions of Mexico , a fruit salad ( watermelon , orange , jÃ cama , cucumber and sometimes melon and papaya ) tossed in lime juice and hot sauce or chamoy and sprinkled with a salty chili powder is also known as pico de gallo ; it is a popular snack and usually sold outside schools , while the tomato-based condiment is better known as salsa picada , which means minced or chopped sauce , salsa bandera or salsa mexicana , because the colors red ( tomato ) , white ( onion ) , and green ( chili ) are the colors of the Mexican flag . One of the sources for the name `` rooster 's beak '' could be the beak-like shape and the red color of the chilis used to make it . According to food writer Sharon Tyler Herbst , it is so called because originally it was eaten with the thumb and forefinger , and retrieving and eating the condiment resembled the actions of a pecking rooster . Another suggested etymology is that pico is derived from the verb picar , which has two meanings : 1 ) to mince or chop , and 2 ) to bite , sting or peck . The rooster , gallo in Spanish , is a common metaphor for the hyper-masculine ( `` macho '' ) male in Mexican culture . One example of such machismo is taking pride in withstanding the spicy burn of chilis . However , neither theory can be considered definite , as they assume the use of hot chilis . In many regions of Mexico the term `` pico de gallo '' refers to any of a variety of salads , condiments or fillings made with sweet fruits , tomatoes , tomatillos , avocado or mild chilis â '' not necessarily with hot chilis , or any chilis at all . Thus , the name could be a simple allusion to the bird feed-like minced texture and appearance of the sauce . Like any recipe using raw ingredients , care should be taken in the preparation and storage of salsa , since many raw-served varieties can act as a growth medium for potentially dangerous bacteria , especially when unrefrigerated . Washing the vegetables before slicing and using clean utensils should keep health issues at bay . In 2002 , a study appearing in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine , conducted by the University of Texasâ `` Houston Medical School , found that 66 % of the sauces tested ( 71 samples tested , sauces being either : salsa , guacamole , or pico de gallo ) from restaurants in Guadalajara , Jalisco and 40 % of those from Houston , Texas , were contaminated with E. coli bacteria , although only the sauces from Guadalajara contained the types of E. coli that cause diarrhea . The researchers found that the Mexican sauces from Guadalajara contained fecal contaminants and higher levels of the bacteria more frequently than those of the sauces from Houston , possibly as a result of more common improper refrigeration of the Mexican sauces . In a 2010 July 12 press release the Center for Disease Control reported that during the 1998-to-2008 period , 1 out of 25 foodborne illnesses with identified food sources was traced back to restaurant salsa or guacamole . According to a 2010 July 13 news item by journalist Elizabeth Weise , a 2008 outbreak of Salmonella was traced back to the peppers used in salsa .

The 1959 Formula One season included the 10th FIA Formula One World Championship season , which commenced on May 10 , 1959 , and ended on December 12 after nine races . Jack Brabham won the title in a sport still reeling from the tragic loss of several drivers , including reigning champion Mike Hawthorn . Vanwall 's withdrawal , believed to have been a result of the high mortality rate of the 1958 season , left Ferrari as the only race-winning team in the Championship . However , the British dominance continued with Cooper 's revolutionary rear-engined cars . Powered by the compact Coventry-Climax 2.5 litre engine , the Coopers driven by Jack Brabham , Stirling Moss and Bruce McLaren won five races and BRM finally won one in the hands of Jo Bonnier . Aston Martin also appeared with a car which , in the face of Cooper 's rear-engined revolution , was outdated and overweight . The German Grand Prix was held for the second time on the very high speed AVUS circuit , where Ferrari 's Jean Behra was killed during an unrelated sports car race . Ferrari 's Tony Brooks took the fight to the Coopers and going into the final race he , Moss or Brabham could win the title . Moss retired from the race , the inaugural United States Grand Prix , giving Brabham the lead . Brabham ran out of fuel on the last lap but pushed his car across the line to finish fourth . With Brooks unable to do better than third Brabham became the first Australian World Champion while Cooper won the Constructors crown . The following teams and drivers competed in the 1959 FIA World Championship . Points were awarded on an 8-6-4-3-2 basis to the first five finishers at each race . However a manufacturer only received points for its highest placed car and only the best five results from the eight races were retained . Other Formula One races also held in 1959 , which did not count towards the World Championship .
Tank or Tonk , is the capital city of Tank District , Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa , Pakistan . The city 's location near Waziristan . It is located at 32 Â 13 ' N. and 70 Â 32 ' E and is situated to the north-west of the Indus River and close to the Takht-i-Sulaiman Range . Tank is hot and humid in summer . It 's a minor yet thriving city at the west bank of the Indus river . To the far western side of the city lies the Federally Administered Tribal Areas abbreviated to FATA making Tank the gateway to the no-mans land as the FATA is commonly perceived . The mainly Pashtun tribes that inhabit the area are fiercely independent , but until recently the tribes had very friendly relations with Pakistan . In 1972 , 14,306 inhabitants ; 1981 , 25,003 ; 1998 , 33,930 . The city was situated inside a fort , a trench was dug around it and filled with water . When the British came they called it Tank . `` It stands on the left batik of a ravine which issues from the Tank Larn pass , 40 miles north-west of Dera Ismail Khan town . A mud wall surrounds the town , 12 feet in height and 7 feet thick , with numerous towers and two or three gates , but it is in bad repair . The fort , now in ruins , is an enormous pile of mud about 250 yards square . The walls , faced with back , enclose a citadel 40 feet high '' . It was the residence of a Nawab of Tank ( Shah Nawaz Khan ) from Katti Khel family , who formerly exercised semi-independent powers . After defeating the Sikhs , Tank came under British control , here Sir Henry Durand , lieutenant-governor of the Punjab , was killed in 1870 when passing on an elephant under a gateway . Dubbed as the Little England , this town is a staging point for most of the tribes of the region During British rule , Tank was the Headquarters of Tank Tehsil which was then a subdivision of Dera Ismail Khan District . The population of the town according to the 1901 census of India was 4,402 . Tank was declared a ` notified area ' in 1893 . The municipal income in 1903-4 was Rs . 11,500 , ' chiefly derived from octroi ; and the expenditure was Rs . 9,100 . Timber and ghi were brought down from the hills of Waziristan in considerable quantities , while the exports included grain , cloth , tobacco , and other luxuries . Sir Henry Durand , Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab , lost his life here in 1870 , from injuries received while passing on an elephant under a gateway . He was buried at Dera Ismail Khan . The British negotiated with the tribes through their agents in the border towns and Tank was a center of negotiation with the Mahsud tribe - the Nawab of Tank having married a Mahsud wife . For the Britishers the Mahsud tribe was the most difficult to control , and in 1860 when the Mahsuds attacked the British with a 3000 strong Lashkar the British were forced to penetrate into the territory of Tank to control them .

A waffle is a batter - or dough-based cake cooked in a waffle iron patterned to give a distinctive and characteristic shape . There are many variations based on the type and shape of the iron and the recipe used . Other waffle-shaped foods exist , and are sometimes referred to as waffles because of their shape . Most are actually potato products . Waffles are eaten throughout the world , particularly in Belgium and the United States . Common toppings are strawberries , chocolate , sugar , honey , syrups , ice cream and more . Waffles can be desserts and breakfasts . Wafer and waffle share common etymological roots . Wafre ( `` wafer '' ) occurs in Middle English by 1377 , adopted from Middle Low German wÃ cents fel , with the l changed to r. Modern Dutch wafel , French gaufre , and German Waffel , all meaning `` waffle '' , share the same origin . The Dutch form , wafel , was adopted into modern American English as waffle in the 18th century . The modern waffle has its origins in the wafersâ '' very light thin crisp cakes baked between wafer ironsâ '' of the Middle Ages . Wafer irons consisted of two metal plates connected by a hinge , with each plate connected to an arm with a wooden handle . The iron was placed over a fire and flipped to cook both sides of the wafer . The irons were used to produce a variety of different flat , unleavened cakes , usually from a mixture of barley and oats , instead of the white flour used today . In 14th-century England , wafers were sold by street vendors called waferers . The modern waffle is a leavened form of wafer . Waffles can be eaten plain ( especially the thinner kinds ) or sprinkled with powdered sugar . Depending on the region they may be eaten with various toppings such as syrup ( maple syrup , chocolate syrup , flavored syrup ) , honey , Nutella , butter , jam , fruits ( e.g. bananas , blueberries , boysenberries , raspberries , strawberries ) , chocolate chips or dulce de leche . Ice cream cones are also a type of waffles or wafers .
Maiasaura ( from the Greek '' Î 1\/4 Î Î Î + Ï Î Ï Ï Î '' , meaning `` caring mother lizard '' ) is a large duck-billed dinosaur genus that lived in the area currently covered by the state of Montana in the Upper Cretaceous Period ( Campanian ) , about 74 million years ago . Maiasaura was large , attaining an adult length of about 9 m and had the typical hadrosaurid flat beak and a thick nose . It had a small , spiky crest in front of its eyes . The crest may have been used in headbutting contests between males during the breeding season . This dinosaur was herbivorous . It walked both on two ( bipedal ) or four ( quadrupedal ) legs and appeared to have no defense against predators , except , perhaps , its heavy muscular tail and its herd behavior . These herds were extremely large and could have comprised as many as 10,000 individuals . Maiasaura was discovered by Laurie Trexler and described by dinosaur paleontologist Jack Horner ( paleontologic advisor for the Jurassic Park movies ) and Robert Makela . He named the dinosaur after Marion Brandvold 's discovery of a nest with remains of eggshells and babies too large to be hatchlings . These discoveries led to others , and the area became known as `` Egg Mountain '' , in rocks of the Two Medicine Formation near Choteau in western Montana . This was the first proof of giant dinosaurs raising and feeding their young . Over 200 specimens , in all age ranges , have been found . Maiasaura lived in herds and it raised its young in nesting colonies . The nests in the colonies were packed closely together , like those of modern seabirds , with the gap between the nests being around 7 m ; less than the length of the adult animal . The nests were made of earth and contained 30 to 40 eggs laid in a circular or spiral pattern . The eggs were about the size of ostrich eggs . The eggs were incubated by the heat resulting from rotting vegetation placed into the nest by the parents , rather than a parent sitting on the nest . Upon hatching , fossils of baby Maiasaura show that their legs were not fully developed and thus they were incapable of walking . Fossils also show that their teeth were partly worn , which means that the adults brought food to the nest . The hatchlings grew from a size of 16 t long in the span of their first year . At this point , or perhaps after another year , the animal left the nest . This high rate of growth may be evidence of warm bloodedness . The hatchlings had different facial proportions from the adults , with larger eyes and a shorter snout . These features are associated with cuteness and are common among animals that are dependant on their parents ' for survival during the early stages of life . In the Two Medicine Formation , Maiasaura lived alongside the tyrannosaurid Daspletosaurus , the oviraptorosaurian Chirostenotes , the troodontid Troodon , the dromaeosaurids Bambiraptor and Saurornitholestes , the enantiornithe bird Avisaurus , the nodosaurid Edmontonia , the ankylosaurid Euoplocephalus , the ceratopsids Achelousaurus , Brachyceratops , Einiosaurus , and Styracosaurus ovatus , the hypsilophodont Orodromeus , and the hadrosaurids Hypacrosaurus stebingeri and Prosaurolophus .

In 2009 Finding Nemo - The Musical was honored with a Thea award for Best Live Show from the Themed Entertainment Association . Leonardo Pisano Bigollo ( c. 1170 â `` c. 1250 ) also known as Leonardo of Pisa , Leonardo Pisano , Leonardo Bonacci , Leonardo Fibonacci , or , most commonly , simply Fibonacci , was an Italian mathematician , considered by some `` the most talented western mathematician of the Middle Ages . '' Fibonacci is best known to the modern world for the spreading of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system in Europe , primarily through the publication in the early 13th century of his Book of Calculation , the Liber Abaci ; and for a number sequence named after him known as the Fibonacci numbers , which he did not discover but used as an example in the Liber Abaci . Leonardo Fibonacci was born around 1170 to Guglielmo Fibonacci , a wealthy Italian merchant . Guglielmo directed a trading post ( by some accounts he was the consultant for Pisa ) in Bugia , a port east of Algiers in the Almohad dynasty 's sultanate in North Africa ( now Bejaia , Algeria ) . As a young boy , Leonardo traveled with him to help ; it was there he learned about the Hindu-Arabic numeral system . Recognizing that arithmetic with Hindu-Arabic numerals is simpler and more efficient than with Roman numerals , Fibonacci traveled throughout the Mediterranean world to study under the leading Arab mathematicians of the time . Leonardo returned from his travels around 1200 . In 1202 , at age 32 , he published what he had learned in Liber Abaci ( Book of Abacus or Book of Calculation ) , and thereby popularized Hindu-Arabic numerals in Europe . Leonardo became an amicable guest of the Emperor Frederick II , who enjoyed mathematics and science . In 1240 the Republic of Pisa honored Leonardo , referred to as Leonardo Bigollo , by granting him a salary . In the 19th century , a statue of Fibonacci was constructed and erected in Pisa . Today it is located in the western gallery of the Camposanto , historical cemetery on the Piazza dei Miracoli . In the Liber Abaci ( 1202 ) , Fibonacci introduces the so-called modus Indorum ( method of the Indians ) , today known as Arabic numerals ( Sigler 2003 ; Grimm 1973 ) . The book advocated numeration with the digits 0 â `` 9 and place value . The book showed the practical importance of the new numeral system , using lattice multiplication and Egyptian fractions , by applying it to commercial bookkeeping , conversion of weights and measures , the calculation of interest , money-changing , and other applications . The book was well received throughout educated Europe and had a profound impact on European thought . Liber Abaci also posed , and solved , a problem involving the growth of a population of rabbits based on idealized assumptions . The solution , generation by generation , was a sequence of numbers later known as Fibonacci numbers . The number sequence was known to Indian mathematicians as early as the 6th century , but it was Fibonacci 's Liber Abaci that introduced it to the West . In the Fibonacci sequence of numbers , each number is the sum of the previous two numbers , starting with 0 and 1 .

PKN Orlen is a major European oil refiner , and petrol retailer . The company is Poland 's and Central Europe 's largest publicly traded firm with major operations in Poland , Czech Republic , Germany , and the Baltic States . In 2009 , it was ranked in the Fortune Global 500 as the world 's 31st largest oil company and the world 's 249th largest company overall , and was the only Polish company ranked by Fortune . However , it dropped as low as to the position of 398 by the year 2010Poland by Fortune GLobal 500 The firm was created through the merger of Poland 's two communist oil monopolies . PKN Orlen has its roots in the creation of C.P.N. , Communist Poland 's petroleum retail monopoly in 1944 . In the 1950s , the second block of PKN Orlen was formed , Petrochemia PÅ ock , a state firm in charge of the refineries in PÅ ock and grew to become the largest complex of its kind in Poland . After the merger of CPN and Petrochemia Plock , the company was renamed into Polski Koncern Naftowy ( PKN ) , with Orlen added several months later as the consortium 's brand name . The new name is derived from Orl - for `` orzeÅ '' ( Polish : eagle ) and its adjective `` orli '' , and - en for `` energia '' ( Polish : energy ) . In 1999 , both firms were partially privatized and merged to create a retail and refining company under the name PKN Orlen . Orlengate is the biggest corruption scandal in the modern political history of Poland . It happened during the rule by the leftist government of the postcommunist party SLD ( Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej , Democratic Left Alliance ) . Disclosed in 2004 , the scandal started with the arrest on 7 February 2002 by the UOP ( Office for State Protection ) of Andrzej Modrzejewski , the CEO of PKN Orlen . Today , Orlen is the largest fuel retailer in Poland with over 2000 locations . It also has significant investment abroad including the buy out of MaÅ 3\/4 eikiÅ Nafta and a majority stake in Unipetrol , a Czech refiner . In 2003 PKN Orlen had the chance to acquire 500 filling stations in Northern Germany from BP under premise of an anti-competition rule when BP took over Aral . As of 2007 PKN Orlen has 581 filling stations in Germany ( 484 under the Star brand , 58 under the Orlen brand and 29 under a supermarket brand ) . PKN Orlen was involved in merger talks with MOL Group , a Hungarian oil company in 2005 . If merged , the two firms would have created a regional giant , and controlled much of Central Europe 's oil industry . However , the planned merger failed due to high politicization . Following the dropped merger plans , PKN Orlen bought a majority stake in Czech Unipetrol . During May 2006 , the company announced its largest investment ever when it took over a majority share of Lithuania 's MaÅ 3\/4 eikiÅ Nafta , the largest company in the Baltic States , from Yukos . With the completion of the takeover , PKN Orlen became Central Europe 's largest company . PKN Orlen , under a joint venture with the Netherlands firm Basell , also owns Poland 's largest plastics company . In 2007 , it was ranked 432 in the Fortune Global 500 and 679 in the Forbes Global 2000 list of companies . Orlen employs over 24,000 people in 4 countries .
`` Tunak Tunak Tun '' or `` Tunak '' , is a bhangra\/pop love song by Indian artist Daler Mehndi released in 1998 . At the time , critics complained that Mehndi 's music was popular due to his videos that featured beautiful women dancing . Mehndi 's response was to create a video that featured only himself . The song was a success , with the unexpected benefit of becoming a cult hit in other countries . The song has also become an internet meme , inspiring numerous online parodies . The music video was the first made in India to use bluescreen technology , which allowed the singer to superimpose his image over various computer-generated backgrounds , one featuring St. Basil 's Cathedral in Moscow . World of Warcraft , a massively multiplayer online role-playing game produced by Blizzard Entertainment , features a fictional race named the Draenei . All playable races within the game have signature dances that can be performed , and the dance employed by the male Draenei appears to have been inspired by the Tunak Tunak Tun music video .
The Treaty of Berlin ( 1889 ) was the concluding document of the conference at Berlin in 1889 on Samoa . The conference was proposed by German foreign minister Count Herbert von Bismarck ( son of chancellor Otto von Bismarck ) to reconvene the adjourned Washington conference on Samoa of 1887 . Herbert von Bismarck invited delegations from the United States and the British Empire to Berlin in April 1889 . The treaty launched the condominium in Samoa between the United States , Germany and Great Britain . It was designed to guarantee the preservation of rights of the three powers as secured in separate treaties with the Samoan rÃ gime in 1878 and 1879 . Further , the independence and neutrality of the Samoan government was ensured , public finance was reorganized and the Samoan king elected in 1881 was restored . In an effort to strengthen the judiciary an American\/European chief justice position was created , and the municipality of Apia was reestablished , chaired by a council president . An impressive feature of the condominium was the appointment of often distinguished and competent individuals in the administration . The treaty was signed at Berlin by the three powers on 14 June 1889 ; ratifications were exchanged on 12 April 1890 and assented to by the Samoan government on 19 April 1890 , in effect four governments were party to the Berlin Act . The condominium ended in political shambles after ten years with the ratification of the Tripartite Convention of 1899 and the resulting partition of the Samoan archipelago .
Spaghetti Western , also known as Italo-Western , is a nickname for a broad sub-genre of Western film that emerged in the mid-1960s , so named because most were produced and directed by Italians . The language in which the movies were originally released was Italian as well . The typical team was made up of an Italian director , Italo-Spanish technical staff , and a cast of Italian , Spanish , German and American actors , sometimes a fading Hollywood star and sometimes a rising one like the young Clint Eastwood in three of Sergio Leone 's films . The films were shot in inexpensive locales resembling the American Southwest , primarily in central and southern Italy , such as the parks of Valle del Treja ( between Rome and Viterbo ) , the area of Camposecco ( next to Camerata Nuova ) , characterized by a karst topography , the hills around Castelluccio , the area around the Gran Sasso mountain or the Tivoli 's quarries , but also Sardinia and the Andalusia region of Spain , AlmerÃ a at three main studios , Texas Hollywood , Mini Hollywood , and Western Leone . Typical themes in Spaghetti Westerns include the Mexican Revolution , Mexican bandits , and the border region shared by Mexico and the United States . Originally , spaghetti westerns were characterized by their production in the Italian language , low budgets , and a recognizable highly fluid and minimalist cinematography which eschewed ( even `` demythologized '' ) many of the conventions of earlier Westerns . This was partly intentional and partly the context of a different cultural background . The first entirely Italian western movie was Il terrore dell ` Oklahoma ( 1959 ) , directed by Mario Amendola . The best-known and perhaps archetypal films were the `` Man with No Name '' trilogy ( or `` Dollars Trilogy '' ) directed by Sergio Leone , starring Clint Eastwood and with the musical scores of Ennio Morricone : A Fistful of Dollars ( 1964 ) , For a Few Dollars More ( 1965 ) , and The Good , the Bad and the Ugly ( 1966 ) .

Listaller simply includes the Autopackage packages into its own package container format and handles Autopackage like any other Listaller package file . A multitrack recording master tape , disk or computer files on which productions are developed ( or captured , in a live session ) for later mixing , is known as the multi-track master , while the tape , disk or computer files holding a mix ( mono , stereo or Surround ) is called a mixed master . It is standard practice to make a copy of a master recording , known as a safety copy , in case the master is lost , damaged or stolen . The phrase `` original master recording '' began in the period of acoustical audio recording - one `` cuts '' a recording because the sound is literally cut into the record . The resulting record was then used as the `` master '' , or original prototype from which further vinyl or acetate copies could be pressed . There is only one original master recording , and that 's the recording made at the time of the original recorded performance , but the term `` master '' is commonly used to describe almost anything used as a source . There are several methods by which master recordings are created . The first ( and oldest of those in current technological use ) is `` direct to tape . '' This is where one ( mono ) , two ( stereo ) , or more microphone signals are equalized , mixed , and recorded directly to a mono or stereo ( 2 track ) tape . This tape is the master . The other method is called `` multitrack recording '' and most recently in digital terms , `` session files '' . By these methods , each microphone signal or line input is recorded to its own track on a multi-track recorder . At a later time , the signals that were recorded on this multi-track format will be reproduced , equalized , and mixed down to a stereo or mono tape , which is also called the master tape . A multi-track tape may be remixed many times , in different ways , on different days , by different engineers , giving the possibility of several masters ( AM radio version , mono version , LP stereo version , single version , guitarist 's personal version with lead solos emphasized , etc ) . Any of these would have the designation `` first generation '' , but not necessarily `` master '' , which means there could be many alternate mixes . With multi-track recording one has the option of changing the emphasis on any given instrument , replacing it or omitting it entirely . Song masters and album masters are considered intellectual property . As with physical property , ownership is acquired by purchasing it , creating it or inheriting it . In this sense , the intellectual property concept applies similarly in the purchase of a house , a car or any other property . The ownership to the master will however not necessarily correspond with the title to the copyright in the audio work . Thus , the sale of a master tape will in most jurisdictions not necessarily imply the transfer of copyright to the songs recorded . Before a song or album master is released , the value of the master is determined by the cost to produce it . After release , the value of the master is determined by its potential to sell CDs . The master and all rights associated with it may be sold for several times the production cost or `` recoupable cost '' . In a typical independent artist\/production deal , the artist will pay the studio up front to produce songs or an album of songs . In this deal , the artist , having financed the project , owns the master . If the studio , production company or record company finances the master , sometimes called a `` spec '' deal , then that studio or company owns the master . Major record companies and their major indie satellite labels will not offer the artist the option to finance the production of their own master . This is because major labels have an interest in building and maintaining their catalog of albums , and as a result , will likely own the masters indefinitely . An independent artist may also do a distribution deal where the independently produced master is temporarily licensed to a major label , and then returned to the original owner ; the artist , manager , producer or investor as the case may be . A recording may generate revenue for the artist and studio\/record company simultaneously , regardless of who owns the master . The revenue from CD sales is broken down to `` mechanical royalties '' and `` artist royalties '' . Sale of the master refers to a buyout of the intellectual property , usually by a major label . If an independent record becomes very popular , a label could consider buying the master . In this instance , the buyout price will usually be several times the raw cost ( recoupable cost ) of producing the recording . It is rare that an artist will purchase the master recording after its release .
Travis Wayne Childers ( born March 29 , 1958 ) is the former U.S. Representative from , serving from the 2008 special election until 2011 . He is a member of the Democratic Party . The district includes much of the northern portion of the state including New Albany , Columbus , Oxford , Southaven , and Tupelo . Childers was defeated for re-election in 2010 . Childers was born in Booneville in Prentiss County , Mississippi on March 29 , 1958 . He is the son of John Wayne and Betty ( nÃ e Smith ) Childers . His father , John Wayne Childers ( a native of Glen ) , died when his son was 16 years old ; in high school he worked nights and weekends at the first convenience store in Booneville to support his mother , Betty , and sister , Tammy . He is of French , Italian , Swiss , English , Chickasaw , and Choctaw descent . Childers attended Northeast Mississippi Junior College and then the University of Mississippi , where he received a bachelor 's degree in business administration in 1980 . While a student at Ole Miss , Childers became licensed as a Real Estate Salesperson by the Mississippi Real Estate Commission ( MREC ) and consequently became a Realtor . After graduating he joined Robert Davis ' real estate business in Booneville and worked there throughout the 1980s . Eventually he became licensed as a Real Estate Broker by MREC prior to his ownership of Travis Childers Realty & Associates , a successful Northeast Mississippi real estate firm . He also owns , with his wife Tami , Landmark Community , a personal care home , and Landmark Nursing Center , an 80-bed skilled care facility and Alzheimer 's disease unit . In 1991 , Childers was elected Prentiss County Chancery Clerk . He was re-elected five times ( with 75 percent of the vote the final time ) . In 2001-2002 , Childers served as president of the Mississippi Chancery Clerks Association . Childers , a Blue Dog Democrat , votes 83 % of the time with his party , but has been described as a conservative Democrat . Like many Democrats from Mississippi , he is pro-life and pro-gun . However , on economic issues , Childers tends to vote more with his party . He supports increased funding for public education . He also favors a swift withdrawal of American troops from Iraq . In the 111th Congress , while voting for the stimulus packages and reauthorization of SCHIP , Childers has voted against several more controversial bills , most notably the `` Helping Families Save Their Homes Act '' . Childers bucked the Democratic leadership in voting against both versions of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 . More recently Childers voted against the 2009 Matthew Shepard Act and joined most Blue Dog Democrats in opposing the 2009 American Clean Energy and Security Act . Childers voted with 38 other Democrats against the Affordable Health Care for America Act . However , he is against full repeal of the bill . A special election in Mississippi 's 1st congressional district was triggered when 12-year Republican incumbent Roger Wicker was appointed by Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour to the United States Senate seat vacated by Trent Lott . Childers was endorsed by the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal , the Commercial Dispatch , and the Commercial Appeal . Several candidates qualified for the election . In the initial April 22 special election , Childers won 49.4 percent of the vote , falling just 400 votes short of the majority ( 50 percent plus one ) needed to avoid a runoff . On May 13 , Childers faced Republican candidate Greg Davis ( who had won 46.3 percent on April 22 ) . Childers won the runoff . This election returned the district to the Democrats . The seat was held by Democrat Jamie Whitten of Charleston for 54 years â '' the longest tenure of any congressman until Michigan representative John Dingell passed the mark on February 11 , 2009 . Whitten retired in 1995 and was succeeded by Wicker . Childers ' victory came as a major shock to the Republicans . The district has a decided conservative bent ; Wicker had won his first race for the seat with 63 percent of the vote and had n't faced serious opposition since . The district has only supported the official Democratic candidate for president once since 1956 ; George W. Bush carried the district with 62 percent of the vote in 2004 . Childers and Davis faced each other again in the general election on November 4 , 2008 . Childers won a full term , defeating Davis 54 % to 44 % . Childers was up for re-election on November 2 , 2010 . He was challenged by Republican State Senator Alan Nunnelee , Constitutionalist Gail Giaramita , Libertarian Harold Taylor , Reformist Barbara Dale Washer , and Independent Wally Pang . Nunnelee defeated Childers . Childers and his wife , Tami , have two children : Dustin , a recent graduate from Mississippi College School of Law , and Lauren , a freshman at the University of Mississippi . Lauren Childers was Miss University of Mississippi 2010 . Childers and his family attend the East Booneville Baptist Church .

Salty liquorice , salmiak or salmiakki is a variety of liquorice that contains a relatively large amount of ammonium chloride ( `` salmiac '' ) in addition to the liquorice root extract , sugar and starch or gum arabic that constitute regular liquorice . Ammonium chloride has a spicy taste that vaguely resembles that of sodium chloride ( table salt ) . However , salty liquorice does not necessarily contain any sodium . Although some types of regular liquorice can also contain a small amount of ammonium chloride , salty liquorice can contain up to about 8 percent of ammonium chloride . Moreover , the salty taste is typically less masked by a high sugar content compared to regular liquorice . Salty liquorice candies are almost always black or very dark brown and can range from very soft to very hard and may be brittle . The other colors used are white and variants of gray . Carbon black is used as a food coloring agent in these candies . Salty liquorice is popular in the Nordic countries , as well as Northern Germany , the Netherlands and the Baltic states . The following are the names used for this snack in various countries : The Latin term for ammonium chloride is sal ammoniac , a term that has also been used in English . In Finnish , the candies are usually called salmiakki , although this can also refer to other products containing ammonium chloride . The terms salmiakkimakeinen ( salmiac candy ) or salmiakkilakritsi ( salmiac liquorice ) are also sometimes used . For pure ammonium chloride , the term raakasalmiakki ( raaka = raw ) can be used , if necessary . Salmiakki was once a trade name of Fazer , but quickly became a genericized trademark like nylon . The canonical shape for Finnish salmiakki candies is a black diamond-shaped lozenge . This diamond shape is so typical that in Finnish , the word `` salmiakki '' can sometimes refer to this shape instead of the candy . For example , Finnish Defense Forces reserve officer students rank insignia are known as `` salmiakki `` s for their distinctive shape . However , especially in other countries , different shapes are used . In Swedish , Danish , and Norwegian , the candies are sometimes called salmiaklakrits , salmiaklakrids , and salmiakklakris respectively ; salmiak ( k ) refers to the ammonium chloride ingredient . In Dutch , the term salmiakdrop usually refers to salty liquorice with a high concentration of ammonium chloride , whereas zoute drop ( salted licorice ) contains regular salt . Also readily available in the Netherlands is a powder-based candy called Salmiak which comes in sweet and salty flavors . Similar flavored candies can occasionally be purchased in America as double-salt licorice , or Dutch double salts . In addition to being used in candy , salmiak is also used to flavor vodka , chocolate , distilled rye brandy , ice cream , cola drinks , snus , and recently , meat ( `` Salmiakkipossu '' is a brand of salmiak-flavoured pork , probably named as a pun on `` Salmiakkikossu '' , meaning salmiak-flavoured Koskenkorva ) .
`` Jurassic Park '' is a song by `` Weird Al '' Yankovic . It is a parody of `` MacArthur Park '' by Jimmy Webb ( as performed by Richard Harris ) , and is written as a humorous take on the film of the same name . The promo single only contains `` Jurassic Park '' . Yankovic , when asked how he came up with the idea for the song , stated , `` I was driving a rent-a-car through Florida when the song ` Lola ' came on the radio , and it got me thinking about how much fun I had doing ` Yoda , ' where I took a then-current topic and combined it with a classic rock tune . Then I flashed on Jurassic Park which had just come out , and was already well on its way to becoming the biggest hit in box office history . I thought of various songs that I could combine that with , and then I hit on ` MacArthur Park . ' It felt like a natural . I got permission from Jimmy Webb ( composer of `` MacArthur Park '' ) , from Michael Crichton ( author of the novel on which the movie is based ) and of course from Steven Spielberg , whose blessing made it possible for us to cut through miles of legal red tape . '' Part of the humor of the song lies in the contrast between the catastrophic events of the movie , with much loss of human life and destruction of property , and the cynical banality of the singer 's complaints , i.e. , `` This has been one lousy day , '' and `` What a crummy weekend this has been . '' This sets in in probably intentional opposition to MacArthur Park , which reaches an emotional climax over what seems to be a fairly unimportant incident involving a cake . The parody only features parts of the song , the verses , choruses , the instrumental ( shortened ) , and the ending . The middle section ( `` There will be another song for me ... '' ) is missing . Intermixed during the interlude are various dinosaur sound effects courtesy of Sandy Berman . After the release of Alapalooza `` Jurassic Park '' got light rotation on MTV . `` Weird Al '' Yankovic went on to say , '' ( MTV ) played it a few times , and then just yanked it , because it was n't really part of their sound . '' However , the single was a success on The Box and in Canada , where it was a Top Five hit . The combination of the two made Alapalooza work commercially . The music video is done mostly with claymation in the style of Will Vinton 's Dinosaurs ! - A Fun-Filled Trip Back in Time ! , parodying scenes from , as well as the general plot of the 1993 movie and was approved by the film 's director , Steven Spielberg . The animation was done by Mark Osborne and Scott Nordlund .

It was announced on 8 September 2008 that the song would be released as a digital download to all those who had purchased the mp3 version of the band 's album . The download was made available straight after the song 's first play on Zane Lowe 's BBC Radio 1 show on 9 September 2008 . The song was physically released on 20 October 2008 , one week prior to the album 's full release . The song itself does not feature on the download-only album , but appeared on the physical release . It peaked at number 39 on the UK Singles Chart . Talking about `` Talons '' on Bloc Party 's official website , frontman Kele Okereke said : â We wanted to keep things fresh and we thought the fans would be more excited to get a new song rather than something off the album . Talons is one of the last songs we recorded during the Intimacy sessions and I always had it in mind to be one of the extra tracks we promised for the CD if it turned out well . It turned out great so we decided to make it the next single . Iâ m enjoying this way of working , not over-thinking things , just make a decision and get on with it ! Itâ s quite liberating in a way , Iâ m sure itâ s going to be the way things happen more and more in the futureâ
Ian Samuel `` Sam '' Totman ( born 26 April 1979 in London , UK ) is a guitarist and main songwriter for the power metal band DragonForce . Totman was born in England , but moved to New Zealand at an early age . He began playing classical guitar at the age of nine , receiving formal training for many years . He was part of the blackened power metal band Demoniac , which also featured his future DragonForce bandmate Herman Li . During his time with Demoniac , Sam was referred to as Heimdall ( the Norse God of vigilance ) . Demoniac struggled to achieve any real fame , despite releasing 3 albums and re-locating from Wellington , New Zealand to London , UK . Due to this , Demoniac split sometime in late 1999 , shortly after the album The Fire and the Wind was released . Most of the members went on to form power metal band DragonHeart , which later became known as DragonForce . Keyboardist Steve Williams and bassist Steve Scott left DragonHeart to form Power Quest with whom Sam recorded on their demo and first album , Wings of Forever . Sam also provided guest instrumentation on the band 's following album , Neverworld . Totman is the primary songwriter of DragonForce , writing both music and lyrics for a majority of their discography .
The Weserstadion is a multi-purpose stadium in Bremen , Germany . The stadium is scenically situated on the north bank of the Weser River and is surrounded by lush green parks ( the name ` Werder ' is a regional German word for â river peninsulaâ ) . The city center is only about a kilometer away . It is the home stadium of local football team Werder Bremen . It is currently used mostly for football matches . It presented a bid to be a host city in the 2006 FIFA World Cup , which was ultimately turned down . Artists that have performed at the stadium include Bon Jovi , Michael Jackson , Depeche Mode , Metallica , The Rolling Stones , Tina Turner and Van Halen , among others . The Wester Stadium is in a current state of modification , for the most part controlled by Hauke Wilkens . The Stadium will be transformed into a pure football venue , with the purpose of tightening the atmosphere by moving the spectators closer to the pitch . Modifications therefore include the removal of the space in front of the curves with the addition of a third tier , which will expand the capacity to more than 50,000 people .
Kirby 's Dream Land 3 , known as Hoshi no Kirby 3 in Japan , is the fifth platformer video game starring Kirby . Specifically , it is the third game under the Kirby 's Dream Land name . Although the first two games were largely unrelated , Dream Land 3 features many similar characters to Dream Land 2 . Kirby 64 : The Crystal Shards was the sequel to this game . Kirby 's Dream Land 3 is the last first party game released for the Super NES in North America , although it is not the final game for the system ( the 1998 Super NES version of Frogger would be the final game in North America , while the 2000 Super Famicom remake of Metal Slader Glory was the final game in Japan ) . Problems with the game 's PAL conversion prevented it from being released in Europe and Australia for many years ; it was finally released in those regions in the form of an import from North America on July 24 , 2009 . The game was re-released on the Virtual Console in North America on January 5 , 2009 and in Japan on April 28 , 2009 . The game 's platforming mechanics are very similar to most other Kirby games , as is Kirby 's skillset . Kirby is able to jump , duck , slide , fly ( by inflating himself ) , as well as perform his signature move : inhaling enemies . When Kirby inhales an enemy , it can be spit back out as a projectile , or swallowed . Normally this has no effect on Kirby , although specific enemies grant Kirby copy abilities , a staple of the Kirby games . Copy abilities replace Kirby 's standard inhaling move with a special attack , depending on the enemy Kirby ate . For example , swallowing a fire-based enemy allows Kirby to become a fireball . At any time during play , Kirby can summon Gooeyâ '' a blue , long-tongued blob first seen in Dream Land 2 . Doing so costs Kirby two hit points . When controlled by the computer , Gooey follows Kirby around and helps him to defeat enemies . ( Gooey can also be controlled by a second human player . ) Gooey 's abilities are similar to Kirby 's : He can swallow enemies using his long tongue , then either spit them out or copy their abilities to a limited extent . Kirby can also inhale Gooey and swallow him , reclaiming his two hit points . In addition to Gooey , Kirby can team up with any one of his six other friends , three of which were introduced in the previous game in the series . This friend mechanic allows Kirby to be ridden , carried or rolled , enabling new team-based abilities , as well as variations of Kirby 's copy abilities . Kirby 's Dream Land 3 uses a mode of the SNES termed `` pseudo high-resolution '' ( which allows for color blending between two adjacent pixels ) to blend dithered sprites . The cartridge also takes advantage of SA-1 technology to process game data at a faster rate , which was necessary for the large number of bitmaps and special effects used by faster releases . The game received mixed reception from both fans and critics . Because the game was released in close relation to Kirby Super Star , the game was panned by critics and fans for not using Super Star 's style of gameplay , instead offering a more simplistic and rudimentary experience similar to Kirby 's Dream Land 2 .

Hebe Maria Camargo ( born March 8 , 1929 ) is a Brazilian television presenter , actress and singer . Hebe Camargo was born in TaubatÃ , SÃ # o Paulo , on March 8 , 1929 . She began her career as a singer in the 1940s with her sister Estela , as Rosalinda e Florisbela . During her singing career , Camargo performed sambas and boleros in nightclubs . She left her musical career to devote more time to radio and television . She was invited by Assis Chateaubriand to attend the first live broadcast of Brazilian television , in the neighborhood of SumarÃ , SÃ # o Paulo , Brazil . As a singer , Hebe appeared in comedy films of Mazzaropi and starred with Agnaldo Rayol in one of them . In the 1950s , she entered television and worked as a presenter in a series on TV Paulista . In 1955 , Camargo appeared in the first program for women on Brazilian television , O Mundo Ã das Mulheres ( The World for Women ) , on television in Rio de Janeiro , which was seen five times a week . In the 1960s , Camargo moved to the Rede Record television network , where , for many years , she maintained top-rated program . During the Jovem Guarda era , Hebe gave way to new talent . On April 10 , 1966 the Rede Record network began broadcasting a Sunday program featuring Camargo as an interviewer . Camargo has been seen on almost all the television stations in Brazil , including the Rede Record and Rede Bandeirantes , in the 1970s and 1980s . In 1980 , after a long hiatus she returned to work as interviewer . Starting in 1986 Camargo was on the SBT Network , where she presented the television programs Hebe por Elas , Fora do Ar , and Hebe , which is still on the air . She also participated in the Telethon , comedy specials , and Romeu e Julieta , in which she starred with Ronald Golias and Nair Bello . In 1995 EMI released a CD of Camargo 's greatest hits . In 1999 she issued another CD . On April 22 , 2006 she celebrated her thousandth program on SBT . She also has participated in social activities , such as when she took part in the Cansei movement , a 2007 protest critical of the Brazilian government . Camargo was spending New Year 's Eve in Miami , United States , when she complained of severe abdominal pain . A bulletin issued by the hospital later reported that Hebe was subjected to a diagnostic laparoscopy , which found cancer . On January 8 , 2010 , Camargo was admitted to Albert Einstein Hospital in SÃ # o Paulo for surgery to remove cancer from the peritoneum . After surgery and chemotherapy , she returned to work on March 8 , 2010 . On April 28 , 2010 Hebe underwent a clinical examination at the Albert Einstein Hospital in SÃ # o Paulo . The survey found that the cancer that gripped since January 2010 had completely resolved and no more . So she does not need more undergoing chemotherapy sessions . `` God never left me , never saw life with so much joy '' , she said to thank the support of their fans . At 81 years , `` Hebe Camargo '' prepares to record her first live DVD . In two shows , one in SÃ # o Paulo , Credicard Hall ( October 27 , 2010 ) and Rio de Janeiro Citibank Hall ( November 24 , 2010 ) , the blonde will share the stage with figures of Brazilian music . FÃ bio Jr. , Daniel , Leonardo , Maria Rita , Paula Fernandes , and ChitÃ # ozinho & XororÃ and Bruno e Marrone will be next to the Brazilian diva defining moment of his career . `` The show is quite varied . I think no need to go , I 'll be there watching ... '' he says . `` My biggest fear is no one in , '' she said in a press conference in SÃ # o Paulo on Tuesday ( 21 ) . `` I never gave a press conference . I 'm scared , '' he said . On the CD , which hits stores the first week of October 2010 , `` Hebe '' still divides songs with great music personalities such as Roberto Carlos . `` I recorded my part in SÃ # o Paulo and my guests in Rio de Janeiro , '' she said , recalling names like Daniel Boaventura and Ivan Lins are also on the project . In the past , the queen of television had to choose between a career as a presenter or the music . `` I made two albums before this , but were not very good . I guess because the presenter was covering the singer . '' Asked from which it takes as much energy to go on tour ( which should start in March 2011 ) , it 's fast , `` the joy of having a quick recovery ( Hebe went through a cancer earlier this year ) gave me that energy ... Also , I eat well and sleep just like a doll . I like to joke that I am an artist , `` she explained that after performing in SÃ # o Paulo and Rio to record the live DVD goes to other Brazilian capitals . `` Certainly we Belo Horizonte , Porto Alegre , Salvador ... There will be 12 concerts , one per month . If it does , I do more . ''

Caroline van Dommelen ( 9 November 1874 -- 4 March 1957 ) was a Dutch film actress of the silent era . She appeared in eleven films between 1911 and 1918 .
An elastic modulus , or modulus of elasticity , is the mathematical description of an object or substance 's tendency to be deformed elastically ( i.e. , non-permanently ) when a force is applied to it . The elastic modulus of an object is defined as the slope of its stress-strain curve in the elastic deformation region : where lambda ( Î '' ) is the elastic modulus ; stress is the restoring force caused due to the deformation divided by the area to which the force is applied ; and strain is the ratio of the change caused by the stress to the original state of the object . If stress is measured in pascals , since strain is a dimensionless quantity , then the units of Î '' are pascals as well . Since the denominator becomes unity if length is doubled , the elastic modulus becomes the stress needed to cause a sample of the material to double in length . While this endpoint is not realistic because most materials will fail before reaching it , it is practical , in that small fractions of the defining load will operate in exactly the same ratio . Thus , for steel with a Young 's modulus of 30 million psi , a 30 thousand psi load will elongate a 1 inch bar by one thousandth of an inch ; similarly , for metric units , where a thousandth of the modulus in gigapascals will change a meter by a millimeter . Specifying how stress and strain are to be measured , including directions , allows for many types of elastic moduli to be defined . Three other elastic moduli are Poisson 's ratio , LamÃ 's first parameter , and P-wave modulus . Homogeneous and isotropic ( similar in all directions ) materials ( solids ) have their ( linear ) elastic properties fully described by two elastic moduli , and one may choose any pair . Given a pair of elastic moduli , all other elastic moduli can be calculated according to formulas in the table below at the end of page . Inviscid fluids are special in that they can not support shear stress , meaning that the shear modulus is always zero . This also implies that Young 's modulus is always zero .
`` Brothers & Sisters '' is a song by Coldplay , released as their first single in 1999 following the Safety EP , released a year earlier . It was later re-released as an EP . After forming in 1998 , Coldplay met up with local record label Fierce Panda Records after a representative from said label saw them perform at the Camden Falcon in December of that year . Fierce Panda offered to release their debut single , and the band agreed , signing a short record deal . 1,500 copies of the vinyl single were issued in a special wraparound picture sleeve . It peaked at # 107 on the UK Singles Chart . According to the singles liner notes , recording completed in only four days and cost the band a lowly sum of Â # 400 . The atmospheric sounds on `` Easy to Please '' were created by setting up microphones on a wet road outside the studio . A new version of `` Brothers & Sisters '' later appeared on the `` Trouble '' single .

OberallgÃ u is a district in Bavaria , Germany . It is bounded by ( from the north and clockwise ) the districts of UnterallgÃ u and OstallgÃ u , the Austrian states Tyrol and Vorarlberg , the district of Lindau , and the state of Baden-W Ã 1\/4 rttemberg ( district Ravensburg ) . The city of Kempten is enclosed by , but not belonging to the district . Human settlement dates back to the Bronze Age , when Celtic peoples inhabited the region . The Romans established a military camp which grew to become the city of Cambodunum , the present Kempten . It is consequently sometimes claimed that Kempten is the oldest town in Germany . In medieval times Kempten was a free imperial city , and the surrounding lands became subordinate to the lords of Staufen and the counts of Rothenfels . Both ceased to exist in the beginning of the 19th century , when Napoleon handed these territories over to Bavaria . The district of OberallgÃ u was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Sonthofen and Kempten . OberallgÃ u is the southernmost district of Germany . `` OberallgÃ u '' literally means `` Upper AllgÃ u '' . The term AllgÃ u is applied to the part of the Alps located in Swabia and their northern foothills . In the very south of the district there are some of the highest mountains of the AllgÃ u , culminating in the Hochfrottspitze ( 2649 m ) . The Iller River ( a tributary of the Danube ) runs through the district from south to north .

Champagne-Ardenne is one of the 27 regions of France . It is located in the northeast of the country , bordering Belgium , and consists of four departments : Aube , Ardennes , Haute-Marne , and Marne . The region is famous for its sparkling white wine ( champagne ) . Its rivers , most of which flow west , include the Seine , the Marne , and the Aisne . The Meuse flows north . The rail network includes the Parisâ `` Strasbourg line , which follows the Marne Valley and serves Ã pernay , ChÃ cents lons-en-Champagne , and Vitry-le-Fran Ã ois . The LGV Est TGV line also connecting Paris and Strasbourg opened in 2007 and serves Reims with a train station in the commune of Bezannes . The region 's canals include the Canal latÃ ral Ã la Marne and Marne-Rhine Canal , the latter connecting to the Marne at Vitry-le-Fran Ã ois . These are petit gabarit canals . The Vatry International Airport , primarily dedicated to air freight , has a runway 3650 m long , yet it is often unused . The airport is in a sparsely populated area just 150 km from Paris . Some people say it is a good candidate for transformation into a third Parisian airport . Les verts ( the French green party ) supported such a move because the resulting noise pollution would affect fewer people than an airport closer to Paris . The population of Champagne-Ardenne has been in steady decrease since 1982 due to a rural exodus . With 1.3 million people and a density of 52\/km Â , it is one of France 's least populated regions . After a brief period of stabilization in the 1990 's , the region 's population is now among the fastest `` dying '' in Europe , with several municipalities losing people at a faster rate than a lot of Eastern European areas . the region is among the oldest in France , has a weak fertility rate , and its immigrant population , while growing , is still minimal compared to the national average . Visitors often go to Champagne because of its history and its world-famous wine . However , their itineraries diverge when they discover the region 's cultural heritage and its cuisine : some visit Troyes and its ancient houses , others visit Langres and its walls , ChÃ cents lons-en-Champagne and it Cloister , still others visit Ã pernay , Reims , or Colombey-les-deux - Ã glises . The region contains some magnificent forests and lakes where one can enjoy hiking and water sports .

Takehiro Hayashi ( born 23 January 1976 ) is a former Japanese football player .
The President of the Russian Federation is the head of state , supreme commander-in-chief and holder of the highest office within the Russian Federation . Despite the fact that the Constitution of Russia does not explicitly determine the President as the head of the executive branch , the Executive power is de facto split between the President and the Prime Minister , who is the head of government . The current president of Russia is Dmitry Medvedev . Before 25 December 1991 the head of state was known as the President of Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic . According to the Constitution of the Russian Federation , a person willing to run for presidency has to be a citizen of Russia not younger than 35 , and has permanently resided in the Russian Federation for at least 10 years . The Constitution of Russia also restricts the period during which a person can hold the office of the President to two consecutive terms . There is no limit to the total number of terms that a President may serve , just a limit on successive terms . After the oath of office has been taken by the elected president , these following insignia are handed over to the president . These devices are used to display the rank of his office and are used on special occasions . The first insignia that is issued is the chain of office with an emblem . The central emblem is a red cross , with arms in equal size , charged with the Russian coat of arms . On the reverse of the cross , the words `` Benefit , Honor and Glory '' appear in a form of a circle . A golden wreath is used to connect the cross with the rest of the chain . There are seventeen `` links '' in the emblem , with nine consisting of the Russian coat of arms . The other eight consist of a rosette , also bearing the motto `` Benefit , Honor and Glory . '' At the inauguration of Vladimir Putin , the emblem was placed on a red pillow , positioned on the left side of podium . According to the Presidential website , the emblem is placed inside the Kremlin and is used only on certain occasions . The standard is a square version of the Russian flag , charged in the center with the Russian coat of arms . Golden fringe is added to the standard . Copies of the standard are used inside his office , at the Kremlin , other state agencies , and while the president is traveling in a vehicle inside Russia . A 2:3 ratio version of the flag is used when the President is at sea . This is the mostly used symbol to denote the presence of the Russian President . The President also has a special copy of the Russian Constitution that is used during the inauguration . This copy has a hard , red cover with gold lettering . An image of the Russian coat of arms appears in silver . The special copy is kept in the Presidential Library . These insignia and the procedure were established by the presidential decree No. 1138 from 5 August 1996 . and modified by decree No. 832 from 6 May 2000 . In the new decree the special copy of the Constitution was removed as the third symbol of the Russian Presidency ; the other two symbols remained intact because they were and are regulated by separate decrees . Nonetheless , the special copy of the Constitution still exists and serves for inauguration purposes only without being officially presented as a symbol of the Russian Presidency . The primary working President 's residence is the Senate building ( also known as 1st building ) in the Moscow Kremlin complex . Also the President can use the Grand Kremlin Palace ( the ceremonial residence ) and so called 14th building ( the reserve residence ) . The current ( since 2000 ) home President 's residence is Novo-Ogaryovo . It is planned that it will have remained at the disposal of Vladimir Putin after the term ending , as Gorki-9 ( also called Barvikha , but actually near it ) had remained at the disposal of Boris Yeltsin after his retirement . Also , the President has several vacation residences outside of Moscow . None of the Russian presidents to date ever were a member of a political party in office or later . However , former president Vladimir Putin is the nominal head of the government-created United Russia , the dominant Russian political party . The land transport services for the Russian President is provided by the Special Purpose Garage ( SPG ) . The SPG is a unit within the Federal Protective Service . Air transport services for the President are provided by airline company Rossiya . The President 's aircraft use the same color scheme as standard Rossiya aircraft , except for the use of the Russian coat of arms or the Presidential Standard on the empennage instead of the flag of Russia .
New research is finding a link between Vitamin D deficiencies and cognitive impairment which includes memory loss and a foggy brain . Lick It Up is the 11th studio album by the U.S. band Kiss . On the day of the album 's release , Kiss appeared on MTV without their trademark makeup . It was the first public appearance without makeup by Kiss since the very early days of the band . The album cover had bassist\/band co-founder Gene Simmons sticking out his long trademark tongue to show fans that the quartet were still Kiss , with or without makeup . Lick It Up was certified Platinum on December 19 , 1990 . While the title track remains a regular staple in on the band 's live performances , the rest of the album is seldom played live . Lick It Up was named 7th greatest glam metal album by Digital Dream Door . Lick It Up built upon the harder sound Kiss had displayed on 1982 's Creatures of the Night . But while Creatures of the Night was a commercial disappointment for Kiss , Lick It Up sold much better . It was certified gold on December 22 , 1983 , the first Kiss album to achieve certification since 1980 's Unmasked . This is at least partially attributable to the increased publicity the band received after their unmasking . `` Lick It Up '' and `` All Hell 's Breakin ' Loose '' were released as the only two singles from the album . They were accompanied by a pair of similarly themed , tongue-in-cheek videos featuring the band ( along with many scantily clad women ) in desolate , post-apocalyptic settings . This is the first Kiss album that lead guitarist Vinnie Vincent officially contributed to ; he unofficially contributed to Creatures of the Night . Also for the first time , Vincent appeared on the cover art for the album , whereas the already departed Ace Frehley had appeared on the Creatures of the Night cover despite leaving the band after the release of their second compilation album Killers and was not involved in the recording of the album . Vincent , however , was not legally a member of the band . Due partly to disputes over what his role in the band and his pay would be ( some reports indicated that Vincent had asked for , and was flatly denied , a percentage of the band 's gross profits ) , Vincent never signed any contract making his employment official . These disputes , along with a growing attitude by Vincent that he was solely responsible for the resurgence of KISS , would lead to him leaving the band ( or being fired , depending on the source ) after the European leg of the Lick It Up tour . With the band unable to secure a replacement guitarist on such short notice , Vincent was enticed to return for the American leg of the tour . However , his refusal to sign his contract continued to be a sore point . Additionally , a major rift developed between Vincent and the rest of the band over his guitar solos ; what were once 5-8 minute solos timed to finish on a cue so that Paul Stanley could introduce the next song suddenly expanded , in some instances leaving the rest of the band impatiently waiting on stage for Vincent to finish . At an LA Forum show in January 1984 Vincent continued playing despite Stanley 's cueing him to finish the solo ; the two nearly came to blows in the dressing room afterward , with Stanley accusing Vincent of showing him up and Vincent accusing the other three members of ruining his solo and trying to hold him back as a performer . They were separated by Eric Carr and Gene Simmons and a couple of roadies who tried to keep the peace . At a March show in Quebec , Canada , as the band prepared to close out their set , Vincent broke into an impromptu solo , leaving the other band members standing onstage with nothing to do . Vincent left ( or was fired for a second time , again depending on the source ) shortly thereafter . This time the break was permanent . Although according to Simmons and Stanley , Vinnie Vincent was never `` officially '' a member of the band , he appears on the cover and is credited in the liner notes as the band 's lead guitarist . If Vinnie Vincent was `` officially '' the lead guitarist , Lick It Up would be to date one of two Kiss albums in which every song is credited to only band members with no outside writers or no cover songs , the other being 2009 's Sonic Boom In an interview for KISSology 2 , Paul Stanley made the statement that : `` People were now listening with their eyes rather than their ears . Mainly , because Creatures of the Night was arguably a better album than Lick It Up . '' He also made the statement that `` The only reason why I think people bought Lick It Up more than Creatures of the Night was because we had no make-up on .
A diary is a record ( originally in handwritten format ) with discrete entries arranged by date reporting on what has happened over the course of a day or other period . Diaries undertaken for institutional purposes play a role in many aspects of human civilization , including government records ( e.g. , Hansard ) , business ledgers and military records . A diary is not a book , only a sequence of entries or journals of a person 's thoughts or feelings . Generally the term is today employed for personal diaries , in which the writer may detail more personal information and normally intended to remain private or to have a limited circulation amongst friends or relatives . The writer may also describe recent events in his\/her personal diary . The word `` journal '' may be sometimes used for `` diary , '' but generally one writes daily in a diary , whereas journal-writing can be less frequent . Whilst a diary may provide information for a memoir , autobiography or biography , it is generally written not with the intention of being published as it stands , but for the author 's own use . In recent years , however , there is internal evidence in some diaries ( e.g. , those of Ned Rorem , Alan Clark , Tony Benn or Simon Gray ) that they are written with eventual publication in mind , with the intention of self-vindication ( pre - or posthumous ) or simply for profit . Diaries are highly varied , from business notations , to listings of weather and daily personal events , to inner explorations of the human psyche , to expressions of one 's deepest self , to records of thoughts and ideas . By extension the term diary is also used to mean a printed publication of a written diary ; and may also refer to other terms of journal including electronic formats ( e.g. , blogs ) . Someone who keeps a diary is known as a diarist . As internet access became commonly available , many people adopted it as another medium in which to chronicle their lives with the added dimension of an audience . The first online diary is thought to be Claudio Pinhanez 's `` Open Diary , '' published at the MIT Media Lab website from 14 November 1994 until 1996 . Other early online diarists include Justin Hall , who began eleven years of personal online diary-writing in 1994 , Carolyn Burke , who started publishing `` Carolyn 's Diary '' on 3 January 1995 , and Bryon Sutherland , who announced his diary The Semi-Existence of Bryon in a USENET newsgroup on 19 April 1995 . Web-based services such as Open Diary ( started in October , 1998 ) and LiveJournal ( January , 1999 ) soon appeared to streamline and automate online publishing , but growth in personal storytelling came with the emergence of blogs . While the format first focused on external links and topical commentary , widespread blogging tools were quickly used to create web journals . Recent advances have also been made to enable the privacy of internet diary entries . For example , some diary software now stores entries in encrypted format , such 256-bit AES ( Advanced Encryption Standard ) encryption , and others only permit access to the diary after correct PIN entry on a secure USB device . A travel journal , travel diary , or road journal , is the documentation of a journey or series of journeys . A diet journal or food diary is a daily record of all food and beverage consumed , usually for the purpose of the tracking calorie consumption for the purpose of weight loss or other nutritional monitoring . A sleep diary or sleep log is a tool used in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders . The German Tagebuch is normally rendered as diary in English , but the term includes workbooks or working journals as well as diaries proper . For example , the notebooks of the Austrian writer Robert Musil are called TagebÃ 1\/4 cher . Some officer cadets at the Royal Military College of Canada wrote their diaries in India ink on their t-squares ; examples of these from the 1880s are retained in the College 's museum . A war diary is a regularly updated official record of a military unit 's administration and activities during wartime maintained by an officer in the unit . There are numerous examples of fictional diaries . One of the earliest printed fictional diaries was the humorous Diary of a Nobody by George Grossmith and his brother Weedon . 20th century examples include radio broadcasts ( e.g. Mrs. Dale 's Diary ) and published books ( e.g. the Diaries of Adrian Mole ) . Both prompted long-running satirical features in the magazine Private Eye : the former entitled Mrs Wilson 's Diary in reference to Mary Wilson , wife of Prime Minister Harold Wilson , the latter entitled `` The Secret Diary of John Major Aged 47 Â 3\/4 '' and written as a pastiche of the Adrian Mole diaries from the perspective of the then Prime Minister John Major .
Copper ( I ) acetylide , or cuprous acetylide , is an inorganic chemical compound with the formula Cu2C2 . It is a heat and shock sensitive high explosive , more sensitive than silver acetylide . It is a metal acetylide . It is similar to silver acetylide and calcium carbide , though it is not called carbide in literature . Though not practically useful due to high sensitivity and reactivity towards water , it is interesting as a curiosity because it is one of the very few explosives that do not liberate any gaseous products upon detonation . C2H2 + 2CuCl â ' Cu2C2 + 2HCl The reaction product is a reddish precipitate . The reaction is used as a test for acetylene . Copper acetylide is an intermediate in several organic chemistry reactions , eg . Sonogashira coupling or Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling . Copper acetylide can form inside pipes made of copper or an alloy with high copper content , which may result in violent explosion . This was found to be the cause of explosions in acetylene plants , and led to abandonment of copper as a construction material in such plants . Copper catalysts used in petrochemistry can also possess a degree of risk under certain conditions .
A state senator is a member of a state 's Senate , the upper house in the bicameral legislature of 49 U.S. states , or a legislator in Nebraska 's one house State Legislature . There are typically fewer state senators than there are members of a state 's lower house . In the past , this meant that senators represented various geographic regions within a state , regardless of the population , as a way of balancing the power of the lower house , which was apportioned according to population . This changed in 1963 when the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that state legislatures must apportion seats in both houses according to population . A state senator 's job is to represent the people at a higher level than a State Representative .

Blackpool Transport Services ( BTS ) is a bus and tram operator running within the boroughs of Blackpool and Fylde and into the surrounding area , including Fleetwood , Lytham St Annes , Poulton le Fylde and Kirkham , Preston . BTS is a limited company wholly owned by Blackpool Borough Council , which makes it one of the few remaining municipal bus companies in the UK today . The company 's network was relaunched in April 2001 under the name Metro Coastlines . Along with the new name came a new colour-coded service : each core bus route was operated by vehicles painted in a livery heavily featuring that route 's color . There were twelve such core bus routes , and the historic tramway along the promenade also had its own variation of the livery . On Monday 26th July 2010 , Metro Coastlines branding was discontinued and the company went back to their Blackpool Transport days . Buses have had their Metro Coastlines logos removed and replaced with a new Tower and waves logo . Before the July service changes there were 4 guaranteed Low Floor bus routes , Line 3 , Line 5 , Line 14 and Line 16 . Line 2\/2C , Line 4 and Line 7 were usually operated by low Floor buses ( Line 2\/2C and Line 4 = Optare Solo , Line 7 = Optare Excel ) but sometimes had standard floor buses substituted . Line 11 was part Low Floor being part operated by a fleet of 9 East lancashire Dennis Tridents . Since the service changes most buses are low floor with only a small number of non low floor buses in use . Fares on Blackpool Transport depend on the distance traveled , although on buses there is a cap per journey . Most tickets can be purchased from the driver of the first bus boarded . On trams , most tickets can be purchased from the conductor or driver . Pensioners who hold a valid nowcard ( concessionary travel card scheme in Lancashire ) can travel free on buses and trams , passes from other parts of England are accepted for travel on the buses only . Children under five also travel free . Drivers and conductors may also be able to give change in small denominations . One day TravelCards can be purchased on any bus or tram , and longer term TravelCards can be purchased at offices and agents . Between 2001 and 2010 each line ( service ) had its own individual route color which was painted with a contrasting color of yellow , and there were also black generic painted buses which were used on any line if a branded vehicle could n't be used for any reason . Each bus stop also featured the line color and timetables were also color coded . Route branding was discontinued on Monday 26th July 2010 when Blackpool Transport introduced major changes to its bus network . Buses are gradually receiving a new livery of black and yellow . The Line 6 service was axed on Sunday 25th July 2010 after 84 years in service , Optare Deltas 106 , 107 and 112 performed the last duties . The last Optare Delta operated finally on November 27 , 2010 on service 17 . These buses served for over 20 years in the fleet . However two Deltas remain as driver trainers . Since 2002 local bus services have not used the 1960s bus station located on Talbot Road . The town center Blackpool Transport offices were relocated to Market Street . With the new service changes , many services now serve different town center stops . Service Promenade 1 stops at North Pier and Blackpool Tower in both directions . Services 2 and 2C terminate at Corporation Street Stop C1 , with services 11 and 15 also serving this stop . Services 5 , 7 , 9 and 14 call at both Market Street and Corporation Street . Service 10 still terminates at Market Street . Services 3 , 4 now operate via Topping Street ( northbound ) and Clifton Street ( southbound ) , Service 16 also operates via Topping Street and now terminates at Blackpool North Station , Service 17 terminates at Market Street . City Sightseeing service 20 serves Topping Street and the Tower .

They returned to the project only in year 2006 , and the debut album CexCells was put out in August 2007 . AFI have increasingly included synthesized elements into their recent albums ; 2003 release Sing the Sorrow and 2006 release Decemberunderground credit Puget with ` programming and keyboards ' . These synthesized elements are particularly apparent on songs such as `` Death of Seasons '' and `` 37mm '' . In the August 2006 edition of Guitar World , Puget states that AFI songs `` 37mm '' and `` Love Like Winter '' were both originally intended as part of the Blaqk Audio side project . Elements of programming , however , can be found as early as 2000 's The Art of Drowning , which featured a drum machine on `` The Despair Factor '' . Blaqk Audio entered the studio to record several songs for their first album in January 2007 . Puget kept fans apprised with updates through his blog , before the Blaqk Audio MySpace was created in February 2007 . By July 27 , they had filmed footage for the music video for their debut single `` Stiff Kittens '' , but the video was never finished . On January 12 , 2008 , Puget uploaded a new song to the Blaqk Audio MySpace entitled `` The Ligature '' . Instrumental versions of the songs , `` Between Breaths '' and `` The Love Letter '' were used in trailers and on the official website for the 2008 film The Eye . In response to the buzz it created , Puget suggested at a possible public release of all the CexCells songs in instrumental form . Puget did a remix for the band Tokio Hotel of their song `` Ready , Set , Go ! '' called `` Ready , Set , Go ! ( AFI\/Blaqk Audio Remix ) '' and it can be found on the CD Scream America ! . Blaqk Audio contributed a cover of `` No New Tale to Tell '' to the tribute album for Love and Rockets , New Tales to Tell : A Tribute to Love and Rockets . While promoting AFI 's new single `` Medicate '' on KROQ , Havok said that Blaqk Audio 's second album was already completed , but they are focused on AFI as they feel `` if all of a sudden we 're doing two Blaqk Audio records in a row people will think AFI is not happening or something . '' Puget has revealed that the name of the upcoming album is Bright Black Heaven . They have continued writing new songs , so the new album may go through considerable changes before the release . They have recorded over 30 new songs . Since February 2010 the California based radio station Live 105 has been playing a new Blaqk Audio song entitled `` Ill Lit Ships '' . From July 22 , 2010 , BPM on Sirius XM Radio have been playing a new song entitled `` Bon Voyeurs . '' On October 24th , Live105 premiered a song titled `` Mouth to Mouth '' . Blaqk Audio performed at Subsonic Spookfest 2010 with eight songs , three of them being completely new songs : `` This Is ... '' , `` Fade To White '' and `` Let 's Be Honest '' . On November 25th , Blaqk Audio posted a song titled `` Down Here '' on their SoundCloud page . On December 1st Live105 posted a song titled `` Cold War '' .
A major pathway to induce health effects arises from spills or leaks of solvents that reach the underlying soil . Since solvents readily migrate substantial distances , the creation of widespread soil contamination is not uncommon ; there may be about 5000 sites worldwide that have major subsurface solvent contamination ; this is particularly a health risk if aquifers are affected . In English , to be inert is to be in a state of doing little or nothing . In chemistry , the term inert is used to describe something that is not chemically reactive . The noble gases were previously known as inert gases because of their perceived lack of participation in any chemical reactions . The reason for this is that their outmost electron shells ( valence shells ) are completely filled , so that they have little tendency to acquire or lose electrons . It is now known that these gases in fact do react to form chemical compounds , such as xenon tetrafluoride . Hence , they have been renamed to noble gases . However , a large amount of energy is required to drive such reactions , usually in the form of heat , pressure , or radiation , often assisted by catalysts . The resulting compounds often need to be kept in moisture-free conditions at low temperatures to prevent rapid decomposition back into their elements . The term inert may also be applied in a relative sense . For example , molecular nitrogen is inert under ordinary conditions , existing as diatomic molecules , . The presence of a very strong triple covalent bond in the molecule renders it unreactive under normal circumstances . Nevertheless , nitrogen gas does react with the alkali metal lithium to form compound lithium nitride ( Li3N ) , even under ordinary conditions . Under high pressures and temperatures and with the right catalysts , nitrogen becomes more reactive ; the Haber process uses such conditions to produce ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen . Inert atmospheres consisting of gases such as argon , nitrogen , or helium are commonly used in chemical reaction chambers and in storage containers for air-sensitive or water-sensitive substances , to prevent unwanted side-reactions of these substances with air and water . The Federal Insecticide , Fungicide , and Rodenticide Act divides the ingredients in pesticides into two groups : active and inert . An inert chemical , under this context , is one that does not have a toxic effect on the species the pesticide is meant to combat , but that does not rule out that it may still have a biological activity on other species , including being toxic to humans . Solvents , propellents , preservatives , among others , are thus considered inert ingredients in pesticides . Since 1997 , the United States Environmental Protection Agency has recommended that pesticide manufacturers label the non-active ingredients as `` other ingredients '' rather than `` inert '' to prevent misinformation to the public . In the branch of mathematics known as algebraic number theory , a prime ideal is said to be inert if it is still prime when considered in an extension field . Such a prime might have instead split as a product of other prime ideals , but by being inert it remains essentially unchanged . In the field of weapons and explosives , an inert munition is one in which all energetic material such as primers , fuses , and the explosive or incendiary materials within them have been removed or otherwise rendered harmless . Inert munitions are used in military and naval training , and they are also collected and displayed by public museums , or by private parties .
Paintings are sometimes changed because of changed modesty standards , and later sometimes changed back , see e.g. Expulsion from the Garden of Eden . Minimal Instruction Set Computer ( MISC ) is a processor architecture with a very small number of basic operations and corresponding opcodes . Such instruction sets are commonly stack based rather than register based to reduce the size of operand specifiers . Such a stack machine architecture is inherently simpler since all instructions operate on the top most stack entries . A result of this is a smaller instruction set , a smaller and faster instruction decode unit , and overall faster operation of individual instructions . The downside is that instructions tend to have more sequential dependencies , reducing instruction-level parallelism . MISC architectures have much in common with the Forth programming language and the Java Virtual Machine .
Francisco Javier `` Javi '' GarcÃ a FernÃ ndez ( born 8 February 1987 in Mula , Murcia ) is a Spanish footballer who plays for S.L. Benfica in the Portuguese first division . A defensive midfielder by nature , he can also appear as a central defender . A product of Real Madrid 's youth system , GarcÃ a played three La Liga contests with the first team , making his debut at the age of 17 in a 5 â `` 0 home rout of Levante UD , on 28 November 2004 . After that , he would spend the entire 2005 â `` 06 with Real Madrid Castilla , the team 's B-side . The summer of 2006 was a very busy one for GarcÃ a. First , he won the European Championship with the under-19s , impressing then-first team head coach Fabio Capello , who recalled him to training sessions . He played in most of Real Madrid 's pre-season games , including a starting lineup spot in both RamÃ n de Carranza Trophy games , playing in central midfield alongside new purchase Ã merson . He would not appear for Real 's first team in 2006 â `` 07 , nonetheless . In August 2007 , in the season of his supposed definitive promotion to the first team , coach Bernd Schuster would eventually prevent that golden opportunity ( as fellow cantera players RubÃ n de la Red and Esteban Granero also left the club ) and offers began to appear from clubs in the Premier League including Liverpool , and domestic teams , including AtlÃ tico Madrid and Deportivo de La CoruÃ a. He would finally settle for CA Osasuna on 31 August , signing for four seasons for a fee of â 2.5 million as the Navarre side was keen to replace injury-struck midfielder Javad Nekounam ( out of action for six months at least ) . Having first appeared in a 1 â `` 1 home draw with Sevilla FC ( one minute played ) , GarcÃ a scored twice in his first six games , in wins against Levante ( 4 â `` 1 ) and Villarreal CF ( 3 â `` 2 ) . GarcÃ a 's contract included a buy-back clause that could see him return to Real Madrid for â 4 million . Osasuna officially reported , on 29 April 2008 , that Real Madrid had exercised their purchase option , meaning his return to the BernabÃ u for 2008 â `` 09 . He made his first league appearance for Real since his return during his side 's 7 â `` 1 thrashing of Sporting de GijÃ n on 24 September 2008 , coming on as a second-half substitute for Mahamadou Diarra . Deemed surplus to requirements at Real Madrid , GarcÃ a signed for S.L. Benfica in Portugal on 21 July 2009 , for five years and a fee of â 7 million . An undisputed starter throughout his first season , he also found the net on occasion , most notably a header in the last minute for the game 's only goal against AssociaÃ Ã # o Naval 1 Â de Maio at home , as the club clinged onto the leadership ( 9 November 2009 ) and eventually won the championship . GarcÃ a is a cousin of another footballer , Luis GarcÃ a. The latter represented , among others , FC Barcelona , Liverpool and AtlÃ tico Madrid .

Sho Gokyu is a Japanese footballer who plays for Sagawa Shiga . Oswaldo Enrique LÃ pez Arellano ( 30 June 1921 -- 16 May 2010 ) was a two time President of Honduras , first from 1963 to 1971 and again from 1972 to 1975 . He gained power both times via military force . He was born in DanlÃ in the department of El ParaÃ so to an influential family , son of Enrique LÃ pez and Carlota Arellano . He attended the American School of Tegucigalpa where he learned to speak fluent English . He joined the Army at eighteen , graduated as a pilot from the Honduran Air Force School , and spent 1942-1945 in the U.S. state of Arizona studying mechanical aviation . LÃ pez served as a colonel for a long time and eventually rose to the rank of general . He married Gloria Figueroa and they had five children : Gloria Carolina , Oswaldo , Enrique , Leonel , and JosÃ Luis . LÃ pez served briefly on a military junta during 1957 , which resigned after elections were held . He served as president for the first time from 3 October 1963 until 7 June 1971 , taking office when he seized power in the 1963 Honduran coup d' Ã tat , 10 days before presidential elections were due . He then allowed further elections ( Honduran general election , 1971 ) to take place in April 1971 that saw RamÃ n Ernesto Cruz come to power . On 4 December 1972 , LÃ pez again seized power , in the 1972 Honduran coup d' Ã tat . In 1975 , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission exposed a scheme by United Brands Company to bribe President LÃ pez with US$ 1.25 million , with the promise of another $ 1.25 million upon the reduction of certain banana export taxes . Trading in United Brands stock was halted , and on 22 April 1975 LÃ pez was ousted in a military coup led by his fellow General Juan Alberto Melgar , in the 1975 Honduran coup d' Ã tat . This scandal is known in Honduras as `` Bananagate '' . LÃ pez was a businessman . He owned several businesses in Central America . His eldest son , Oswaldo , died in 2003 . He was the owner of TAN-SAHSA , the now defunct Honduran air carrier .
The Earthquake Engineering Research Institute ( EERI ) is a leading technical society in dissemination of earthquake risk and earthquake engineering research both in the U.S. and globally . EERI members include researchers , geologists , geotechnical engineers , educators , government officials , and building code regulators . Their mission , as stated in their 5 year plan published in 2006 , has three points . In the 2006 5 year plan , the EERI has identified four main goals towards fulfilling their mission and planned strategies to carry them out . History section cites Tubbesing , Susan K. , and Thalia Anagnos . `` The Earthquake Engineering Research Institute , a Short History of the U.S. National Earthquake Engineering Society . '' The EERI was formed in 1948 as an advising committee on the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey . It quickly became its own independent , nonprofit organization , with the purpose of studying why buildings fail under earthquake disasters , and what methods can prevent these failures . At first they conducted their research in laboratories of different University or Government groups . As the EERI grew , they began to more often send research funds to the Universities , and have the University conduct the research . EERI focused more on identifying and investigating areas in need of research , and policymaking based off of the universityâ s lab results . In 1952 the EERI organized the first Conference on Earthquake Engineering , at UCLA . In 1955 , they held the first World Conference on Earthquake Engineering . In 1984 , the 8th World Conference was held in San Francisco . This conference brought in scientists from 54 countries . At first , membership to the EERI was limited to invite-only engineers and scientists . In 1973 , they began to hire members by application , and increased their membership from 126 to 721 by 1978 . In 1991 , EERI began receiving funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , to continue publishing information on how to reduce damage from earthquakes . After a number of location changes , the EERI headquarters settled in Oakland , California . Their quarterly journal , Earthquake Spectra , covers current research on earthquake engineering and is available online or by subscription . Its target audience is any geologist , seismologist , or related engineer . EERI also publishes many other types of information , including a monthly newsletter , an oral history series , and field investigation reports . EERI performs risk assessments on earthquake potential sites around the world . This is a quick summary of two reports on California cities . In 2006 an engineering firm related to the EERI has projected over $ 122 billion in damages , if a repeat of the 1906 San Fransisco earthquake occurs . This number includes damages to homes and structures , excluding fire damage . The EERI lobbies for government funding to prevent natural disasters . The money is best spent before loss of life and large scale structural damage , though often it is not seen until afterward , as evidenced by Hurricane Katrina . The EERI and the USGS have identified that a potential large earthquake in Los Angeles would cause more damage than Katrina at New Orleans , with up to $ 250 billion in total damages and 18,000 deaths . EERI has a student chapter in 29 colleges across the U.S. to further promote interest in earthquake engineering . A few representatives from each chapter make up the Student LEadership Council ( SLC ) . Since 2008 the EERI and SLC have held the Undergraduate Seismic Design Competition , which was previously run by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center ( PEER ) . In this competition a team of undergraduate college students must design and construct a structure made of balsa wood . The structure is limited by many rules , such as a weight limit , the individual heights of each floor , total height limit , and more . The structure is subjected to extra weight and placed on a shake table , which moves to simulate an earthquake . An accelerometer is placed on top of the building to measure how fast the top of the building shakes . Studentsâ structures are judged on a number of criteria , including the height of the structure , number of floors , the accelerometer readings , and whether the structure breaks . Students will want to make a building close to the height limit because the higher floors are worth more points . The 8th annual competition is to be held at San Diego , February 11 and 12 , along with the 63rd EERI annual meeting .
Philippe Charles Lucien Christanval ( born 31 August 1978 in Paris ) is a retired French footballer of Guadeloupian origin who most recently played for Fulham as a center back . His career began at AS Monaco in 1999 , where he made 81 appearances , scoring one goal . Here he also won the French title in the 1999\/00 season and made several UEFA Champions League appearances . He was then snapped up by Barcelona for a Â # 6.5 million fee in June 2001 . He had a terrible time from then on attempting to cope with various injuries , particularly following his 2003 move to Marseille . Having spent two weeks on trial at Arsenal , Gunners manager ArsÃ ne Wenger opted not to sign him . He then joined rival London team , Fulham . Upon his signing , Chris Coleman stated : `` Philippe is a player I have been looking at since I have been Fulham manager . I have always admired him . He was excellent at Barcelona but then had problems with injury and fell out of favor with the last few managers he has had . '' `` His quality is there - you can see that . He makes the right decisions . For me the best defenders make the right decisions more often than not and he fits into that category . '' In his first appearances at Fulham , he found himself playing in defensive midfield . He was quite successful with an enforcement partnership with Papa Bouba Diop . His qualities were obvious ; despite being a center back , he had good vision and passing ability . More recently he has found himself back in the center half role . His first Premiership goal was a late equaliser in a 3 -- 3 draw with West Ham United on 13 January 2006 . He has since struggled with injuries , and in the 2007\/08 season has only made a single appearance coming on as sub . At the end of the 2007-08 season , Christanval was released by Fulham and was offered a trial with Premier League club Blackburn Rovers as Christanval was a free agent he would be allowed to join any other club outside the FIFA regulated transfer window . He was however released from Fulham having had an injury plagued 2007\/2008 season . He has since been linked with a move to MLS club Toronto FC . On 9 April 2009 , Christanval retired from football , having been unable to find a new club . Christanval was a part of the France side in the 2002 FIFA World Cup and 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship .
The Nutty Professor is a 1963 Paramount Pictures science fiction comedy feature film produced , directed , co-written ( with Bill Richmond ) and starring Jerry Lewis . The score was composed by Walter Scharf . In 2004 , The Nutty Professor was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' . Professor Julius Kelp ( Jerry Lewis ) , is a nerdy , unkempt , buck-toothed , introverted , accident prone , socially inept university professor who always incurs the wrath of the university administration by continually destroying the classroom laboratory . When a football-playing bully humiliates and assaults him , Kelp tries to beef up . He joins a gym -- to no avail . He then invents a serum that turns him into the handsome , extremely smooth , cool , and obnoxious girl-chasing hipster , Buddy Love . ( Lewis said that the two represented good and evil . ) This newfound persona gives him the confidence to pursue one of his students , Stella Purdy ( Stella Stevens ) . At first she despises Love , but she finds herself strangely attracted to him . Buddy wows the crowd with his jazzy , breezy delivery and cool demeanor at the Purple Pit , a nightclub where the students hang out . He also mixes it up with the bartender , who is instructed on how to mix the latest drinks for the enigmatic entertainer . The formula wears off at inopportune times , often to Kelp 's embarrassment . He must rush back to his laboratory in the hopes that no one will discover his secret . Although Kelp knows that his alternate persona is an arrogant person , he can not prevent himself from continually taking the formula as he enjoys the newfound attention that Love receives . Buddy performs at the annual student dance , and while on the dais , the formula starts to wear off . In the end , his real identity is revealed during the prom , as the Love persona transforms to Kelp during a speech . He gives an impassioned plea that people must learn to like themselves before others can like them in return . He admits that he has learned a valuable lesson , and Purdy admits that she likes Kelp better than Love and they get married . Prompted by his formerly henpecked father 's marketing of the formula ( a copy of which Kelp had sent to his parent 's home for safekeeping ) , Kelp and Purdy decide to license the product and benefit from the profits . The Nutty Professor was filmed from October 9-December 17 , 1962 and is a loose parody of Robert Louis Stevenson 's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde . The Alaskan Polar Bear Heater is a cocktail featured in the film . Buddy Love instructs the bartender ( Buddy Lester ) on how to make it : two shots of vodka , a little rum , some bitters , a smidgen of vinegar , a shot of vermouth , a shot of gin , a shot of scotch , a little brandy , a lemon peel , orange peel , cherry , some more scotch . At one point during the instructions , the bartender quips `` You going to drink this here , or are you going to take it home and rub it on your chest ? '' Love instructs the bartender to `` mix it nice '' and pour it into a tall glass . The bartender asks if he can take a sip ; after doing so , he freezes like a statue . While the drink started as fictional , it is now listed among real drinks . The Nutty Professor was filmed mostly on the campus of Arizona State University ( Tempe , AZ ) in 1962 with the prom portion filmed in the newly completed Gammage Auditorium Hall ( designed by Frank Lloyd Wright ) . The Nutty Professor was released on DVD in October 2000 . In October 2004 a `` Special Edition '' was released including a commentary by Lewis and Steve Lawrence , a documentary and a short feature . In the commentary Lewis discusses aspects of production , including his creating a real-time , on-camera monitor , which subsequently became standard in the film industry . He mentions that he recut the film for his own home viewing . He notes places where he would like to redo the scene , for example making the professor 's watch sound tinny . An animated direct-to-video sequel , The Nutty Professor starring Jerry Lewis and Drake Bell was released November 25 , 2008 . Directed by Paul Taylor , the film involves Julius Kelp 's teenage grandson Harold Kelp discovering his grandfather 's secret formula and unleashing his alter-ego . Lewis has for decades talked about doing a sequel and until now had to settle for the remake starring Eddie Murphy . Murphy did a sequel called Nutty Professor II : The Klumps . On June 29 , 2009 , the New York Times reported that a Broadway musical version of the movie is planned . Jerry Lewis is set to direct , with music by Marvin Hamlisch and lyrics and book by Rupert Holmes .
Other terms include avifauna , which means `` bird fauna '' and piscifauna ( or ichthyofauna ) , which means `` fish fauna '' . Butterscotch is a type of confectionery whose primary ingredients are brown sugar and butter , although other ingredients such as corn syrup , cream , vanilla , and salt are part of some recipes . According to `` Housewife 's Corner '' in an 1848 newspaper , the real recipe for `` making Doncaster butterscotch is one pound of butter , one pound of sugar and a quarter of a pound of treacle , boiled together . '' Butterscotch is similar to toffee , but for butterscotch the sugar is boiled to the soft crack stage , and not hard crack as with toffee . Butterscotch sauce is often made into a syrup , which is used as a topping for ice cream ( particularly sundaes ) . The term butterscotch is also often used for the flavor of brown sugar and butter together even where actual confection butterscotch is not involved , e.g. butterscotch pudding . Food historians have several theories regarding the name and origin of this confectionery , but none are conclusive . One explanation is the meaning `` to cut or score '' for the word `` scotch '' , as the confection must be cut into pieces , or `` scotched '' , before hardening . It is also possible that the `` scotch '' part of its name was derived from the word `` scorch '' . However , the word was first recorded in Doncaster , in England , where Samuel Parkinson began making the confectionery in 1817 . Parkinson 's Butterscotch had royal approval and was one of Doncaster 's attractions until it ceased production in 1977 . The recipe was revived in 2003 when a Doncaster businessman and his wife rediscovered the recipe on an old folded piece of paper which contained a detailed description of the recipe for Butterscotch inside one of the famous St Leger tins in their cellar . Today , Parkinson 's Doncaster Butterscotch Company makes all of its butterscotch to this recipe . Butterscotch is an example of a genericized trademark , originally a trademark of Parkinson 's . The Oxford English Dictionarys first record of the word Butterscot is from 1855 in F. K. Robinson 's Glossary of Yorkshire Words , and of the word Butterscotch in 1856 . Butterscotch is often used as a flavor for items such as dessert sauce , pudding , and biscuits ( cookies ) . To that end , it can be bought in `` butterscotch chips '' , made with hydrogenated ( solid ) fats so as to be similar for baking use to chocolate chips .
Tanystropheus ( Greek Ï Î Î 1\/2 Ï Ï â longâ + Ï Ï Ï Î Ï Î Î Ï Ï â vertebraâ ) , was a 6 metre ( 20 ft ) long reptile that dated from the Middle Triassic period . It is recognisable by its extremely elongated neck , which measured 3 meters ( 10 ft ) long - longer than its body and tail combined . Despite this length , it had only ten neck vertebrae , each quite long . Fossils have been found in Europe , the Middle East and China . Complete skeletons of juvenile individuals are most abundant in the Besano Formation of Italy , dating to 232 million years ago during the middle Triassic period ( Ladinian stage ) . With its incredibly long but relatively stiff neck , Tanystropheus has been often proposed and reconstructed as an aquatic or semi-aquatic reptile , a theory supported by the fact that the creature is most commonly found in semiaquatic fossil sites wherein known terrestrial reptile remains are scarce . Tanystropheus is most often considered to have been piscivorous ( or ` fish-eating ' ) , due to the presence of a long , narrow snout sporting sharp interlocking teeth . In several young specimens , three-cusped cheek teeth are present in the jaw , which might indicate an insectivorous diet ; however , similar teeth patterns have been found in Eudimorphodon and Langobardisaurus , both of whom are considered piscivores . Additionally , hooklets from cephalopod tentacles and what may be fish scales have been found near the belly regions of some specimens . In 2006 , Dr. Silvio Renesto described a specimen discovered in Switzerland which preserved the impressions of skin and other soft tissue . Renesto interpreted this specimen as supporting the hypothesis that Tanystropheus lived along the shoreline , snatching fish and other marine life from the shallows with its long neck and sharp teeth . The specimen displayed an unusual `` black material '' around the base of the tail , containing several calcium carbonate spherules , suggesting a quite noticeable amount of muscle behind the animal 's hips . In addition to containing powerful hind limb muscles , this unusually large muscle mass would have shifted the animal 's weight to its rear , stabilizing the animal as it swung and maneuvered its massive neck . The specimen described by Renesto also preserved the first reported skin impressions of Tanystropheus , showing that it was covered in semi-rectangular , non-overlapping pattern of scales . Tribelesodon , originally considered to be a pterosaur by Francesco Bassani in 1886 , is now recognized as a junior synonym to Tanystropheus . The best-known species is Tanystropheus longobardicus . Other currently recognized species include T. conspicuus and T. meridensis . In 2002 , fossils of a related genus , Dinocephalosaurus , were collected in marine Triassic deposits in southwestern China . This new creature was 2.7 metres ( 8.9 ft ) long , 1.7 metres ( 5.6 ft ) of which was its neck and head . The specimen was described in 2004 . Tanystropheus was featured briefly in Episode 2 of BBC 's Walking with Dinosaurs spin-off , Sea Monsters . During the show , while Nigel Marvin is swimming around the Triassic seas , he encounters a Tanystropheus amongst a pair of Nothosaurus and a Cymbospondylus . Sneaking up behind the creature , he seizes its tail only for it to break off in a lizard-like fashion . This theory is now discredited . A small model of Tanystropheus was added to the Safari Ltd. 's popular Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh dinosaur model series , in 2000 . The model was green and brown in color with a striking blue underside , and contains a bendable neck ; the only model in the series to date with movable parts . In 2007 , the model was retired , and re-released with a new , more natural color scheme . The new model is brown with a green neck and head , though with a much yellower hue to the original model . It has yellow stripes . Hasbro\/Kenner released a Tanystropheus action figure in the second series of the Jurassic Park toyline . It has been re-released twice , once repainted and once as a mutant in the Chaos Effect toyline as the Tanaconda which was mixed with the DNA of a Tanystropheus and an Anaconda .

BBC Radio 5 Live ( formerly styled BBC Radio Five Live ) is the BBC 's national radio service that specialises in live BBC News , phone-ins , and sports commentaries . It is the principal radio station covering sport in the United Kingdom , broadcasting virtually all major sports events staged in the UK or involving British competitors . Radio 5 Live was launched in March 1994 as a repositioning of the original Radio 5 , itself launched in August 1990 . It is transmitted via analog radio in AM on medium wave 693 and 909 kHz ( 990 kHz at Cardigan Bay ) â '' frequencies originally used by BBC Radio 2 from 23 November 1978 to 26 August 1990 â '' and digitally via DAB , digital television ( satellite , terrestrial and IPTV ) and via an internet stream . Due to rights restrictions , coverage of some events ( in particular live sport ) is not available on-line or is restricted to UK addresses . The station broadcasts from the News Centre at BBC Television Centre with a small office in Manchester and a team of its own reporters based around the UK . The station will be moving in 2011 , as part of a larger shift of some BBC resources , to Salford . The success of Radio 4 News FM during the 1991 first Gulf War led Liz Forgan to suggest in May 1993 the introduction of a combined news and sport network . Accordingly , the `` old '' Radio 5 closed down at midnight on Sunday 27 March 1994 and the new Radio 5 Live began its 24-hour service on the morning of Monday 28 March . The first voice on air was Jane Garvey , who later went on to co-present the breakfast and drivetime shows with Peter Allen . The launch was described by The Times as `` slipp ( ing ) smoothly and confidently into a routine of informative banter '' and The Scotsman as `` professionalism at its slickest . '' The tone of the channel , engaging and more relaxed than contemporary BBC output , was the key to the channel 's success and set the model for other BBC News services later in the decade . The first audiences were some four million , with a record audience of six and a quarter million . Before the launch of digital broadcasting , the station ( and Radio 5 before it ) broadcast for several years on analog satellite with near-FM quality . Among the key editorial staff involved in the design of program formats and recruitment of staff for the new station were Sara Nathan , later editor of Channel 4 News , and Tim Luckhurst , later editor of The Scotsman newspaper and currently Professor of Journalism at the University of Kent . Former presenters include Susan Bookbinder , Jon Briggs , Jon Champion , Adrian Chiles , Edwina Currie , Fi Glover , Nick Hancock , Brian Hayes , Peter Heaton-Jones , Jane Hill , Des Lynam , David Mellor , Louise Minchin , Paddy O'Connell , Jonathan Pearce , Nick Robinson , Sybil Ruscoe , Bill Turnbull , Sian Williams , Eamonn Holmes , Mark Saggers and Wendy Robbins . In 2005 the Radio Five Live Sporting Yearbook ( ISBN 0-00-721598-3 ) was published . The station won five Sony Awards , one gold and four silver , in 2005 and was nominated an additional six times . The lone gold award was in the News Story Award category for its coverage of the 2004 Asian tsunami . BBC Radio 5 Live were Official Broadcasters of the 2006 World Cup along with talkSPORT . Both stations broadcast live Premier League commentaries from August 2007 , with the 7 rights packages being shared 6 to 1 in favor of 5 Live . A companion station , BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra , was launched as a digital-only service on 2 February 2002 . In August 2007 , BBC Radio Five Live was renamed BBC Radio 5 Live and was given a new logo . BBC policy for major breaking news events has a priority list . With UK news , the correspondent first records a `` generic minute '' summary ( for use by all stations and channels ) and then priority is to report on Radio 5 Live , then on the BBC News Channel and onto any other programs that are on air . For foreign news , first a `` generic minute '' is recorded , then reports are to World Service radio , then the reporter talks to any other programs that are on air . Most non-cricket broadcasts are available online only from IP addresses within the UK as both television and radio rights are typically sold on a country-by-country basis . Often UEFA Champions League games are not broadcast live online at all due to rights restrictions imposed by UEFA . This is sometimes not the case for matches in the knockout stage involving English clubs playing at home , whereby domestic radio stations may bid for non-exclusive rights to all coverage , including online broadcast . Sports Extra typically emphasizes full broadcasts of Premier League and Home Nations football if games overlap each other . Five Live carries the first-choice match in such cases . Despite the fact that commercial stations ( such as Sky Sports ) have acquired the vast majority of sports television broadcasting rights in the UK , the BBC remains dominant in radio sport with BBC Radio 5 Live and its local radio stations . Its main commercial rival for radio sports rights is TalkSPORT .
`` Dig It '' is a song by The Beatles featured on their album Let It Be . The song is credited to Lennon\/McCartney\/Harrison \/ Starkey . It is one of the few songs to be credited to all of the Beatles ; the others are `` Flying '' ( Magical Mystery Tour ) , `` Suzy Parker '' ( Let It Be film ) , `` 12-Bar Original '' ( Anthology 2 ) , `` Los Paranoias '' ( Anthology 3 ) and the Beatles ' version of `` Free as a Bird '' . This song and the 39-second `` Maggie Mae '' appear on the Let It Be album , but are not included on the Let It Be ... Naked album , instead being replaced with `` Do n't Let Me Down '' . Glyn Johns ' May 1969 version of the album , then titled Get Back , had a 3:59 excerpt of `` Dig It '' , which was later reduced to the much shorter version in the final album . Several versions were recorded during the Get Back\/Let It Be sessions , on 24 , 26 , 27 , 28 , and 29 January 1969 , at Apple Studio . The 51-second version on the album is an extract taken from the 26 January version , which was a 15-minute jam that evolved from a loose `` Like a Rolling Stone '' jam . A segment of the jam session , 4 minutes and 30 seconds in length , appears in the documentary film Let It Be . The participants in that session are John Lennon on vocals and 6-string bass , George Harrison on guitar , Paul McCartney on piano , Ringo Starr on drums , and Billy Preston at the organ ; also participating in the jam , but not heard on the released version , was Linda Eastman ( soon to be Linda McCartney ) 's six-year-old daughter Heather . In the early part of the jam , Lennon sings the main lyric with interjections from Harrison , while Heather adds wordless vocals . As the performance winds down , Lennon exhorts the others to continue . McCartney adds a baritone backup vocal of `` dig it up , dig it up , dig it up '' and variations , and Lennon begins to repeat `` Like a rolling stone '' , then goes into the `` famous persons '' part ( mentioning `` the FBI '' , `` the CIA '' , `` the BBC '' , `` B.B. King '' , `` Doris Day '' , and `` Matt Busby '' ) . The excerpt on the Let It Be album fades in on Lennon 's second `` Like a rolling stone '' and concludes with Lennon speaking in a falsetto : `` That was ` Can You Dig It ? ' by Georgie Wood , and now we 'd like to do ` Hark , the Angels Come ' . '' The second sentence of that line is cut off in Let It Bes film recording of the jam session . ( `` Wee Georgie Wood '' was a 4 ' 9 '' music-hall performer and child star . ) The interjection actually comes from the first version , recorded on the 24th . This version was much different , described by Beatles bootleg scholars Doug Suply and Ray Schweighardt as `` sounding like a cross between the traditional ` Sailor 's Hornpipe ' and a slowed down rendition of Neal Hefti 's ` Batman , ' as played on slide guitar . '' An excerpt from this version can be heard on the `` Fly on the Wall '' bonus disc to Let It Be ... Naked In another version , recorded on a different day ( but very similar in style to the one recorded on the 26th ) Lennon begins to shout songs that the Beatles were currently working on in the studio : ' `` Do n't Let Me Down '' , `` Get Back '' , `` I 've Got A Feeling '' , `` Two of Us '' , `` All I Want Is You '' , `` Teddy Boy '' , `` One After 909 '' , `` All Things Must Pass '' , `` Dig It '' , `` Let It Be '' , `` The Long and Winding Road '' , `` For You Blue '' , `` Maxwell 's Silver Hammer '' , `` Across The Universe , `` I Me Mine '' , `` She Came In Through The Bathroom Window '' ' . His voice then trails off into a muddle speech .
Saltopus ( `` hopping foot '' ) is a genus of very small bipedal dinosauriform , roughly 60 centimeters ( 23 in ) long , not much bigger than a rabbit , that was discovered in Scotland by Friedrich von Huene in 1910 . It was a late Triassic carnivore . Probably the size of a small cat , with hollow bones like those of a bird , it may have weighed in at around two pounds ( one kilogram ) . Based on related forms , it probably had five-fingered hands and a long head with dozens of sharp teeth . To date , Saltopus is known only from very poor material , mostly hind limb fragments . It has been variously identified as a saurischian ( lizard-hipped ) dinosaur , a more advanced theropod , and a close relative of the herrerasaurs , but its taxonomy is in dispute because only fragmentary remains have been recovered . Some researchers , such as Gregory S. Paul , have suggested it may represent a juvenile specimen of a coelophysid theropod such as Coelophysis or Procompsognathus . Rauhut and HungerbÃ 1\/4 hler suggested it is a primitive dinosauriform , not a true dinosaur , closely related to Lagosuchus .
Sho Ito ( ä 1\/4 è -- ç '' ItÅ ShÅ ; born July 24 , 1988 in Kasugai , Aichi Prefecture , Japan ) is a Japanese football player who plays for Japanese team Shimizu S-Pulse and represented Japan 's Under-20 team at the 2006 AFC Youth Championship . Ito is dubbed the `` Japanese Thierry Henry '' for his size , technical abilities and pace , and is the first Japanese footballer to go straight from high school to a European club . In August 2006 , Ito received a trial from English club Arsenal , where he impressed manager ArsÃ ne Wenger . However , his work permit application fell through , and in January 2007 , he signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with Grenoble , a club owned by Index Corp , a Japanese mobile content provider .
Motoori Norinaga was a Japanese scholar of Kokugaku active during the Edo period . He is probably the best known and most prominent of all scholars in this tradition . Norinaga was born in Matsuzaka of the province of Ise ( now Matsuzaka City in Mie prefecture ) . He was the second son of the Ozu merchant house of Matsuzaka ( the film director YasujirÅ Ozu was a descendant of the same line ) . After his elder brotherâ s death , Norinaga succeeded to the Ozu line . At one stage he was adopted out to a paper-making family but the bookish boy was not suited to business . It was at his mother 's suggestion that , at the age of 22 , Norinaga went to Kyoto to study medicine . In Kyoto , he also studied Chinese and Japanese philology under the neo-Confucianist Hori Keizan . It was at this time that Norinaga became interested in the Japanese classics and decided to enter the field of Kokugaku under the influence of OgyÅ `` Sorai and KeichÅ `` . ( With changes in the language , the ancient classics were already poorly understood by Japanese in the Edo period and texts needed philological analysis in order to be properly understood . ) Life in Kyoto also instilled in the young Norinaga a love of traditional Japanese court culture . Returning to Matsuzaka , Norinaga opened a medical practice for infants while devoting his spare time to lectures on the Tale of Genji and studies of the Nihon Shoki ( Chronicles of Japan ) . At the age of 27 , he bought several books by Kamo no Mabuchi and embarked on his Kokugaku researches . As a doctor , he adopted the name of one of his samurai ancestors , Motoori . In 1763 , Norinaga met Mabuchi in person when the latter visited Matsuzaka , a meeting that has come down in history as â the night in Matsuzakaâ . Norinaga took the occasion to ask Mabuchi to supervise his annotations of the Kojiki ( Records of Ancient Matters ) . Mabuchi suggested that Norinaga should first tackle the annotations to the Man ` yÅ shÅ `` in order to accustom himself to the ancient kana usage known as the man ` yÅ gana . This was the only meeting between the two men , but they continued to correspond and , with Mabuchiâ s encouragement , Norinaga later went on to full-fledged research into the Kojiki . Norinagaâ s disciples included Ishizuka Tatsumaro , Nagase Masaki , Natsume Mikamaro , Takahashi Mikiakira and Motoori Haruniwa ( Norinagaâ s son ) . Although overshadowed by his activities as a Kokugaku scholar , Norinaga spent 40 years as a practicing doctor in Matsuzaka and was seeing patients until 10 days before his death in 1801 . Norinagaâ s most important works include the Kojiki-den ( Commentaries on the Kojiki ) , made over a period of around 35 years , and his annotations on the Tale of Genji . Norinaga took the view that the heritage of ancient Japan was one of natural spontaneity in feelings and spirit , and that imported Confucianism ran counter to such natural feelings . He criticized OgyÅ `` Sorai for his worship of Chinese civilization and thought , although it has been pointed out that his philological methodology was heavily influenced by Sorai 's . His ideas were influenced by the Chinese intellectual Wang Yangming ( Å YÅ mei in Japanese ) , who had argued for innate knowing , that mankind had a naturally intuitive ( as opposed to rational ) ability to distinguish good and evil . Hitherto scholars of ancient literature had shown a preference for the grandness and masculinity of Man ` yÅ shÅ `` poetry and an aversion to works like the Tale of Genji , which were regarded as unmanly and feminine . Norinaga resurrected the position of the Tale of Genji , which he regarded as an expression of mono no aware , a particular Japanese sensibility of `` sorrow at evanescence '' that Norinaga claimed forms the essence of Japanese literature . In undertaking his textual analysis of ancient Japanese , Norinaga also made vital contributions to establishing a native Japanese grammatical tradition , in particular the analysis of clitics , particles and auxiliary verbs .
Sarcasm is â a sharp , bitter , or cutting expression or remark ; a bitter jibe or taunt . â Though irony is usually the immediate context , most authorities sharply distinguish sarcasm from irony ; however , others argue that sarcasm may or often does involve irony or employs ambivalence . Sarcasm has been suggested as a possible bullying action in some circumstances . The word comes from the late Greek Ï Î Ï Î Î Ï Î 1\/4 Ï Ï ( sarkasmos ) taken from the word Ï Î Ï Î Î Î Î Î Î 1\/2 meaning ` to tear flesh , gnash the teeth , speak bitterly ' . However , the ancient Greek word for the rhetorical concept of taunting was instead Ï Î '' Î Ï Î Ï Î 1\/4 Ï Ï ( chleyasmÏ s ) . Dictionary.com describes the use of sarcasm thus : In sarcasm , ridicule or mockery is used harshly , often crudely and contemptuously , for destructive purposes . It may be used in an indirect manner , and have the form of irony , as in â What a fine musician you turned out to be ! â or it may be used in the form of a direct statement , â You could n't play one piece correctly if you had two assistants . â The distinctive quality of sarcasm is present in the spoken word and manifested chiefly by vocal inflection ... Hostile , critical comments may be expressed in an ironic way , such as saying `` do n't work too hard '' to a lazy worker . The use of irony introduces an element of humor which may make the criticism seem more polite and less aggressive . Sarcasm can frequently be unnoticed in print form , often times requiring the inflection or tone of voice to indicate the quip . Understanding the subtlety of this usage requires second-order interpretation of the speaker 's intentions . This sophisticated understanding can be lacking in some people with certain forms of brain damage , dementia and autism , and this perception has been located by MRI in the right parahippocampal gyrus . Cultural perspectives on sarcasm vary widely with more than a few cultures and linguistic groups finding it offensive to varying degrees . Thomas Carlyle despised it : `` Sarcasm I now see to be , in general , the language of the devil ; for which reason I have long since as good as renounced it '' . Fyodor Dostoyevsky , on the other hand , recognized in it a cry of pain : Sarcasm , he said , was `` usually the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people when the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded . '' RFC 1855 , a collection of guidelines for Internet communications , even includes a warning to be especially careful with it as it `` may not travel well '' . In English , sarcasm in amateur actors is often telegraphed with kinesic\/prosodic cues by speaking more slowly and with a lower pitch . Similarly , Dutch uses a lowered pitch ; sometimes to such an extent that the expression is reduced to a mere mumble . But other research shows that there are many ways that real speakers signal sarcastic intentions . One study found that in Cantonese , sarcasm is indicated by raising the fundamental frequency of one 's voice . Though in the English language there is no standard accepted method to denote irony or sarcasm in written conversation , several forms of punctuation have been proposed . Among the oldest and frequently attested are the percontation point -- furthered by Henry Denham in the 1580s â '' and the irony mark -- furthered by Alcanter de Brahm in the 19th century . Both of these marks were represented visually by a backwards question mark ( unicode U +2 E2E ) . A more recent example is the snark mark . Each of these punctuation marks are primarily used to indicate that a sentence should be understood at a second level . A bracketed exclamation point and\/or question mark as well as scare quotes are also sometimes used to express irony or sarcasm . In certain Ethiopic languages , sarcasm and unreal phrases are indicated at the end of a sentence with a sarcasm mark called temherte slaq , a character that looks like an inverted exclamation point Â . In an increasingly technological world , the use of sarcasm in email , text messaging , message boards and blogs has often been misunderstood as ignorance or stupidity : comments meant to be sarcastic have been taken literally or seriously . A newer trend in using sarcasm in cyberspace is to use an italic font for the proposed sarcastic remark to quell any questions as to the intent of a comment or to enclose the sarcastic remark in sarcasm tags as a form of pseudo-HTML such as the following : I 'm sure they 'll do great .

The pound-force ( symbol : lbF , lb , from Latin libra â poundâ and the symbol F for force ) is a unit of force in systems of measurement including English Engineering units and British Gravitational units . It is equivalent to 4.44822162 newtons . In most contexts , the shorter name `` pound '' is used , but this can introduce confusion with the mass unit of the similar name . The pound-force is equal to the gravitational force exerted on a mass of one avoirdupois pound on the surface of Earth . Since the 18th century , the unit has been used in low-precision measurements , for which small changes in Earth 's gravity ( which varies from place to place by up to half a percent ) can safely be neglected . The 20th century , however , brought the need for a more precise definition . A standardized value for acceleration due to gravity was therefore needed . Today , in accordance with the General Conference on Weights and Measures , standard gravity is usually taken to be 9.80665 m\/s2 ( 32.174 049 ft\/s2 ) . This definition can be rephrased in terms of the slug , a mass unit equivalent to 32.17405 lbm . A pound-force is the amount of force required to accelerate a slug at a rate of 1 ft\/s2 , so : In some contexts , the term `` pound '' is used almost exclusively to refer to the unit of force and not the unit of mass. . In those applications , the preferred unit of mass is the slug , i.e. lbfÂ s2\/ft . In other contexts , the unit `` pound '' refers to a unit of mass. . In circumstances where there may otherwise be ambiguity , the symbols `` lbf '' and `` lbm '' and the terms `` pounds-force '' and `` pounds-mass '' can be used to distinguish . In the `` gravitational '' foot-pound-second ( fps ) system , the weight of the mass unit ( pound-mass ) on Earth 's surface is approximately equal to the force unit ( pound-force ) . The price for this convenience is that the force unit is not equal to the mass unit multiplied by the acceleration unitâ '' the use of Newton 's Second Law , F = mÂ a , requires another factor , gc , usually taken to be 32.17405 lbÂ ft \/ ( lbfÂ s2 ) = 32.17405 lbm\/slug . The `` engineering '' fps system is a coherent system of units : by using the slug as the unit of mass , it avoids the need for such a constant . The `` absolute '' system is similarly coherent ; the SI units are those of the `` absolute '' metric system .

Franco Baresi ( born 8 May 1960 in Travagliato , Italy ) is an Italian football youth team coach and former player . He played as a sweeper and spent his entire career with Serie A club AC Milan , acknowledged as one of the greatest defenders ever to play the game . Baresi was nicknamed `` Piscinin '' , Milanese for `` Little one '' . He is also the younger brother of Internazionale assistant manager Giuseppe Baresi . Hoping Franco could play with him in the Nerazzurri , Giuseppe brought him for a trial in Inter 's youth team , but Franco was rejected . Despite this setback , he did n't give up and decided to try out for arch-rivals AC Milan , where he was accepted . Baresi led the Milan team and its defense for the best part of a decade ; a period during which Milan 's defense was considered by many observers to be one of the best back fours in the history of football , consisting of Baresi , Paolo Maldini , Alessandro Costacurta and Mauro Tassotti . He is also one of the few players who spent his entire career at one club , AC Milan , for whom he played 719 games , scoring 33 goals . He retired from playing in 1997 aged 37 . With Milan , Baresi won six scudetti ( Serie A league titles ) and three European Cups â `` though he did not take part in the last win , his club 's 1994 Champions League victory , through suspension . He mentored defensive partner Paolo Maldini in his later years , whose career has followed a similar path . His number 6 shirt was retired by the club , a rarity for Italian football . Baresi was selected for three World Cups for Italy , in 1982 , 1990 and 1994 . Baresi was part of the 1982 World Cup squad in Spain aged 22 as understudy to Gaetano Scirea , but did n't play , just like in the 1980 European Football Championship , where he was called up along with his brother Giuseppe . His international debut came later in 1982 in a match against Romania . He missed the 1986 tournament , coach Enzo Bearzot preferring Juventus centre-halves Cabrini and Gentile , with Scirea in Baresi 's position of libero . Baresi was unfortunate that his early international career coincided with the peak of Gaetano Scirea 's stint as Italy 's first choice sweeper , and Baresi was continually left out in the cold , much to his frustration , and he refused to play for the national side while Bearzot was in charge ( thus explaining Baresi 's relative lack of caps before the 1990 tournament ) . When the Azzuri crashed out to France in the 1986 tournament and Scirea retired , the mantle was passed to Baresi who returned to the side , a responsibility that become more poignant when Scirea was killed in a car accident aged 36 , only months before Italy was to host the World Cup . So Baresi made his World Cup debut in 1990 . The Azzurri lost to Argentina in the semi-finals , but went on to beat England in the third place play off . In the 1994 World Cup he came one step closer to lifting the trophy as Italy finished runners-up . Baresi injured himself early in the tournament in the group match against Norway , and after emergency surgery , was able to return for the final against Brazil . Baresi suffered cramp in extra time as the patched-up Italians defended against a tired Brazil to a 0 â `` 0 score after 120 minutes , RomÃ rio later attributing his quiet performance to `` The most ruthless monitoring of my entire career '' . Baresi missed the first penalty in the shootout and Italy went on to lose the first World Cup Final to be decided on penalties . Baresi is one of six players to have won all three types of World Cup Medals , having won Gold in 1982 , Bronze in 1990 and Silver in 1994 , despite not playing in any matches in the 82 ' World Cup . The other five players were from West Germany 's squad of 1966 â `` 1974 , and this record is also closely followed by a select group of players who have won two of the awards ( Either Gold and Silver or Gold and Bronze , or Silver and Bronze ) . He was also a member of the Italian squad that finished fourth at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles , California . After a short spell as Director of Football at Fulham , Baresi returned to Milan as a youth team coach in 2002 . He was appointed head coach of AC Milan 's Primavera Under-20 squad . In 2006 , he was moved by the club to coach the Berretti Under-19 squad , with his former fellow Filippo Galli replacing him at the helm of the Primavera squad . He retired from coaching and was replaced by Roberto Bertuzzo . On 4 March 2004 , at a gala ceremony in London , to mark the 100th anniversary of the foundation of the FÃ dÃ ration Internationale de Football Association ( FIFA ) , the international governing body of football revealed the FIFA 100 . The list contains choice of the `` greatest living footballers '' , Baresi was one of many from the legendary Milan teams of the 1990s to be included . Baresi is one of the few players who have won all domestic club , international club and national honors , and doing so all with his native country .
6-plus-6-instruments are chromatic musical instruments . Their keys or cords are in two rows . In each row the tone distance is a wholetone distance . The distance between both rows is a halftone distance . So there is the same fingering in all 6 scales where the base tone is in the same row . If there is a third row , which is a repetition of the first row , there is the same fingering in all 12 scales , e. g. on a piano with a JankÃ keyboard . The 6-plus-6-system is the base of the musical princip of Johannes Beyreuther . The distance of both rows of these instruments are at least in one direction more than a half tone .
Moreno Torricelli ( born 23 January 1970 in Erba ) is an Italian football manager and former defender . Torricelli , born in Erba ( Province of Como ) , started playing football when he was around 8 in the town he was living in , Verano Brianza ( Province of Milan ) . When reached 13 years was asked from Como Calcio to attend with them a youth regional championship ( Allievi Regionali ) but at the end of the loan he had to get back to his former amateur team U.S. Folgore of Verano Brianza . At U.S. Folgore played in the main team too , up to 18 years old , then got transferred to A.S. Oggiono just promoted to top regional league `` Promozione '' at the end of 1987-88 season . In `` Promozione '' Moreno played 49 matches in two seasons without scoring goals . When in 1990 U.S. Caratese obtained his transfer from A.S. Oggiono he was granted a work in a factory and played football on a part-time basis because U.S. Caratese was a high level team attending to the top national amateur league `` Interregionale '' . In July 1992 , Caratese played against Serie A giants Juventus in a pre-season friendly . Torricelli 's performance in this match impressed then-Juventus coach Giovanni Trapattoni so much that he was purchased by for 80 million lire shortly afterwards . Torricelli made his debut in Serie A on 13 September 1992 in a 4-1 win for Juventus against Atalanta . He quickly became a permanent starter in his first season and went on to play in the UEFA Cup-winning side that beat Borussia Dortmund in 1993 . A player with a lot of heart and determination , he was able to command all the roles in the Juventus defense but his favorite role was at right-back . In 1998 , Torricelli left Juventus to join Fiorentina where he played for another four seasons . He moved to Spain 's RCD Espanyol in January 2003 after Fiorentina 's relegation and financial troubles led to them releasing nearly all their players . He retired in 2005 after a final season with A.C. Arezzo . At international level , Torricelli won 10 caps for the Italian national football team , and was a member of the Italian squad for Euro 96 and the 1998 World Cup . On February 2009 , Torricelli took his first managing role in football , being appointed as head coach of Tuscan Lega Pro Prima Divisione side Pistoiese . He took the team at the bottom of the league , and managed to guide it up to 16th place , being however defeated by Foligno in the relegation playoffs . On June 23 , 2009 he was announced as new head coach of Figline for the 2009 â `` 10 Lega Pro Prima Divisione campaign , the first in the Italian third tier for the small Tuscan club . He left the club at the end of the season .
The Post Office Department ( 1792 â `` 1971 ) was the name of the United States Postal Service when it was a Cabinet department . It was headed by the Postmaster General . The Postal Service Act signed by President George Washington on February 20 , 1792 , established the Department . Postmaster General John McLean was the first to call it the Post Office Department rather than just the `` Post Office . '' The organization received a boost in prestige when President Andrew Jackson invited his Postmaster General , William T. Barry , to sit as a member of the Cabinet in 1829 . The Post Office Act of 1872 elevated the Post Office Department to Cabinet status . During the Civil War ( 1861 â `` 65 ) , postal services in the Confederacy were provided by the CSA Post Office Department , headed by Postmaster General John Henninger Reagan . The Postal Reorganization Act was signed by President Richard Nixon on August 12 , 1970 . It replaced the cabinet-level Post Office Department with the independent Postal Service on July 1 , 1971 .

Manganese ( II ) chloride describes a series of compounds with the formula MnCl2 ( H2O ) x , where the value of x can be 0 , 2 , or 4 . The tetrahydrate is the most common form of `` manganese ( II ) chloride '' . MnCl2 Â 4H2O , but the anhydrous form and dihydrate MnCl2 Â 2H2O are also known . Like many Mn ( II ) species , these salts are pink , the paleness of the color being characteristic of transition metal complexes with high spin d5 configurations . Manganese chloride is produced by treating manganese ( IV ) oxide with concentrated hydrochloric acid . MnO2 + 4 HCl â ' MnCl2 + 2 H2O + Cl2 This reaction was once used for the manufacture of chlorine . By carefully neutralizing the resulting solution with MnCO3 , one can selectively precipitate iron salts , which are common impurities in manganese dioxide . Anhydrous MnCl2 is a polymeric solid , which adopts a layered cadmium chloride-like structure . The tetrahydrate consists of octahedral trans-Mn ( H2O ) 4Cl2 molecules The hydrates dissolve in water to give mildly acidic solutions with a pH of around 4 . It is a weak Lewis acid , reacting with chloride ions to produce a series of solids containing the following ions ( MnCl3 ) , ( MnCl4 ) 2 , and ( MnCl6 ) 4 . Both ( MnCl3 ) and ( MnCl4 ) 2 are polymeric . Upon treatment with typical organic ligands , manganese ( II ) undergoes oxidation by air to give Mn ( III ) complexes . Examples include ( Mn ( EDTA ) ) , ( Mn ( CN ) 6 ) 3 , and ( Mn ( acetylacetonate ) 3 ) . Triphenylphosphine forms a labile 2:1 adduct : MnCl2 + 2 Ph3P â ' ( MnCl2 ( Ph3P ) 2 ) Anhydrous manganese ( II ) chloride serves as a starting point for the synthesis of a variety of manganese compounds . For example , manganocene is prepared by reaction of MnCl2 with a solution of sodium cyclopentadienide in THF . MnCl2 + 2 NaC5H5 â ' Mn ( C5H5 ) 2 + 2 NaCl The main application is used in the production of dry cell batteries . It is the precursor to the antiknock compound methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl . MnCl2 is used in 31P-NMR to determine the size and lamellarity of phospholipid vesicles . When manganese chloride is added to a vesicular solution , Mn2 + paramagnetic ions are released , perturbing the relaxation time of the phospholipids ' phosphate groups and broadening the resulting 31P resonance signal . Only phospholipids located in the outermost monolayer exposed to Mn2 + experience this broadening . The effect is negligle for multilamellar vesicles , but for large unilamellar vesicles , a ~ 50 % reduction in signal intensity is observed . Manganism , or manganese poisoning , can be caused by long-term exposure to manganese dust or fumes .
Smuggler 's Run is a video game developed by Angel Studios ( now Rockstar San Diego ) and published by Rockstar Games for PlayStation 2 on October 26 , 2000 . In the game , you play a smuggler who has a number of different vehicles at his disposal including dune buggies , rally cars , and military vehicles . The vehicles are used to smuggle assorted cargo through three different large , open levels . The game , which was an early title release for the PlayStation 2 featured career and 1 or 2-player arcade modes . Two sequels for the game were also created : Smuggler 's Run 2 , which was released for PlayStation 2 on October 30 , 2001 , and Smuggler 's Run : Warzones , which was released for Nintendo GameCube on August 6 , 2002 . The original Smuggler 's Run is now a part of the Sony Greatest Hits series of games that have reached a particular sales milestone for the PlayStation 2 . New to a local smuggling gang , your job is to smuggle cargo through three consecutive levels ( forest , desert , and snow ) with about ten missions per level . In nearly all missions you must evade the U.S. border patrol , the CIA , or rival smuggling gangs . This is basically the career mode of the game . There are a total of 34 missions to complete in this mode . In the turf war mode , you can play three different mini-games , two of which involve smuggling cargo while fighting against a rival gang . The final mini-game is a race through a popular spot through the level of your choice . Joyriding mode is basically a free roam mode where you can explore the level of your choice without having to evade the border patrol . This is a good way to become familiar with the levels and find a quick way through the level during smuggler 's mission . The sales of this game were good . Many of the reviews penalize the game because of its high level of difficulty , while others praise it . A redundancy of gameplay and a frustrating difficulty seems to be a general consensus and a detriment to its receiving a higher average review score . Some reasons for difficulty : The police vehicles are significantly faster and have greater maneuvering capabilities . The time limits leave little room for error . Due to mostly positive reception , Smuggler 's Run has an average score of 79\/100 on Metacritic .
Kalat or Qalat was a princely state located in the center of the modern province of Balochistan , Pakistan . The state capital was the town of Kalat . The State of Kalat was located between 25 Â 1 â and 30 Â 8 â N. And 61 Â 37 â and 69 Â 22 â E. , with a total area of 11593 s. It occupied the whole of the center and south-west of the Province of Balochistan , with the exception of the indentation caused by the little State of Las Bela . It was bounded on the west by Iran ; on the east by the Bolan Pass , the Maxi and Bugti hills , and Sindh ; on the north by the Chagai and Quetta-Pishin Districts ; and on the south by Las Bela and the Arabian Sea . With the exception of the plains of Kharan , Kachhi , and Dasht in Makran , the country is wholly mountainous , the ranges being intersected here and there by long narrow valleys . The principal mountains are the Central Brahui , Kirthar , Pab , Siahan , Central Makran and Makran Coast Ranges , which descend in elevation from about 10,000 to 1200 f. The drainage of the country is almost all carried off to the southward by the Nari , Mula , Hab , Porali , Hingol and Dasht rivers . The only large river draining northwards is the Rakhshan . The coast-line stretches for about 160 m , from near Kalmat to Gwadar Bay , and the chief port is Pasni . Round Gwadar the country was in the possession of the Sultan of Muscat . The state of Kalat was founded in 1638 . The territories controlled by the state fluctuated over the centuries but eventually were established by treaties with the British Agent Robert Sandeman in the late 19th century . Parts of the state to the north and northeast were leased or ceded to form the province of British Baluchistan which later gained the status of a Chief Commissioners province . On 28 March 1948 , the then Khan of Kalat acceded the kalat state to Pakistan in peaceful manner and went on to form the Baluchistan States Union on 3 October 1952 with three neighbouring states . The state of Kalat ceased to exist on 14 October 1955 when the province of West Pakistan was formed . The rulers of Kalat held the title of Wali originally but in 1739 also took the title ( Begler Begi ) Khan usually shortened to Khan . The last Khan of Kalat had the privilege of being the President of the Council of Rulers for the Baluchistan States Union .
Princess Charlotte of Clarence ( Charlotte Augusta Louisa ; 21 March 1819 - 27 March 1819 ) was a member of the British Royal Family , a granddaughter of George III . Princess Charlotte was born on 27 March 1819 at the FÃ 1\/4 rstenhof in Hannover . Her father was The Prince William , Duke of Clarence , the third eldest son of George III and Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz . Her mother was HRH The Duchess of Clarence ( nÃ e Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen ) , the daughter of George I , the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen . At the time of her birth she was fourth in the line of succession to the British throne . Charlotte was christened the same morning as her birth , at the FÃ 1\/4 rstenhof . Princess Charlotte died soon after her birth . Her mother , the Duchess of Clarence , had several difficult pregnancies , making it difficult for the Duke and Duchess to produce any more children . However , another child , Princess Elizabeth of Clarence was born in 1820 , although she too did not survive infancy and died in 1821 .

A single event upset ( SEU ) is a change of state caused by ions or electro-magnetic radiation striking a sensitive node in a micro-electronic device , such as in a microprocessor , semiconductor memory , or power transistors . The state change is a result of the free charge created by ionization in or close to an important node of a logic element ( e.g. memory `` bit '' ) . The error in device output or operation caused as a result of the strike is called an SEU or a soft error . The SEU itself is not considered permanently damaging to the transistor 's or circuits ' functionality unlike the case of single event latchup ( SEL ) , single event gate rupture ( SEGR ) , or single event burnout ( SEB ) . These are all examples of a general class of radiation effects in electronic devices called single event effects . Single event upsets were first described during above ground nuclear testing , from 1954 to 1957 , when many anomalies were observed in electronic monitoring equipment . Further problems were observed in space electronics during the 1960s , although it was difficult to separate soft-fails from other forms of interference . In 1978 , the first evidence of soft errors from alpha particles in packaging materials was described by Timothy C. May and M.H. Woods . In 1979 , James Ziegler of IBM , joined with W. Lanford of Yale , first described the mechanism whereby a sea level cosmic ray could cause a single event upset in electronics . Terrestrial SEU arise due to cosmic particles colliding with atoms in the atmosphere , creating cascades or showers of neutrons and protons , which in turn may interact with electronics . At deep sub-micrometre geometries , this affects semiconductor devices in the atmosphere . In space , high energy ionizing particles exist as part of the natural background , referred to as galactic cosmic rays ( GCR ) . Solar particle events and high energy protons trapped in the Earth 's magnetosphere ( Van Allen radiation belts ) exacerbate the problem . The high energies associated with the phenomenon in the space particle environment generally render increased spacecraft shielding useless in terms of eliminating SEU and catastrophic single event phenomena ( e.g. destructive latch-up ) . Secondary atmospheric neutrons generated by cosmic rays can also be of energies capable of producing SEUs in electronics on aircraft flights over the poles or at high altitude . Trace amounts of radioactive elements in chip packages also lead to SEUs . The sensitivity of a device to SEU can be empirically estimated by placing a test device in a particle stream at a cyclotron or other particle accelerator facility . This particular test methodology is especially useful for predicting the SER ( soft error rate ) in known space environments , but can be problematic for estimating terrestrial SER from neutrons . In this case , a large number of parts must be evaluated , possibly at different altitudes , to find the actual rate of upset . When testing microprocessors for SEU , the software used to exercise the device must also be evaluated to determine which sections of the device were activated when SEUs occurred . By definition , SEUs are non-destructive events . Howevever , under the proper circumstances ( of both circuit design , process design , and particle properties ) a `` parasitic '' thyristor inherent to CMOS designs can be activated , effectively causing an apparent short-circuit from power to ground . This condition is referred to as latchup , and in absence of constructional countermeasures often destroys the device from thermal runaway . Most manufacturers design to prevent latch-up , and test their products to ensure that latch-up does not occur from atmospheric particle strikes . In order to prevent latch-up in space , epitaxial substrates , silicon on insulator ( SOI ) or silicon on sapphire ( SOS ) are often used to further reduce or eliminate the susceptibility . In digital and analog circuits , a single event may cause one or more voltages pulses ( i.e. glitches ) to propagate through the circuit , in which case it is referred to as a single-event transients . Since the propagating pulse is not technically a change of `` state '' as in a memory SEU , one should differentiate between SET and SEU . If a SET propagates through digital circuitry and results in an incorrect value being latched in a sequential logic unit , it is then considered an SEU .

Rami Shaaban ( ; ; born 30 June 1975 in FisksÃ tra , Stockholm ) is a Swedish professional football player . He currently plays as a goalkeeper for Hammarby IF . He is the son of an Egyptian father and a Finnish mother . He has played for a number of teams in England , including Arsenal , and in Sweden . He was a Swedish national team member until 2008 . Shaaban started his senior career at local club SaltsjÃ badens IF before moving to Cairo to play for Zamalek and Ittihad Osman , while also studying at university . After a couple of years , Shaaban returned to his hometown and joined Nacka FF , a club based close to where he grew up . After a string of impressive performances , he was asked to join Swedish first division outfit DjurgÃ rden and , in August 2002 , earned a move to Arsenal . In August 2002 , Shaaban joined Arsenal as a potential replacement for David Seaman . When Seaman was injured , Shaaban played in two matches in the UEFA Champions League-at home against PSV Eindhoven and away against AS Roma , as well as in three matches in the Premier League . Unfortunately , Shaaban broke his leg during training on Christmas Eve 2002 , ultimately sidelining himself for the rest of the season . Due to the severity of his injury , Shaaban feared he would not be able to play again , but after rigorous physical therapy Shaaban was able to resume playing . When Seaman left Arsenal in the summer of 2003 ArsÃ ne Wenger signed Jens Lehmann , who played every match that season as Arsenal went undefeated for the entire 2003-2004 league season . Shaaban was plagued by injuries and failed to become Arsenal 's first-choice keeper . In January 2004 , Shaaban was loaned to West Ham United for a month , but did not make any appearances for the Hammers . In February 2004 , he signed for Brighton & Hove Albion on non-contract terms , making his debut in a 2-1 victory over Sunderland , and signed a short-term contract lasting until the end of the season days later . After his contract expired he was released on a free transfer and had a trial at Dundee United , playing his only match as United beat Sheffield Wednesday to win the City of Discovery Cup ; however , Shaaban could not agree terms and was snapped up by Fredrikstad F.K. . On 12 February 2008 , Shaaban signed a five-year contract with Swedish team Hammarby IF . Shaaban was called up to the Sweden squad for the 2006 World Cup , although he did not have an international cap to his name . He made his debut in the warm up game with Finland as a substitute , coming on for 45 minutes and keeping a clean sheet in a 0-0 draw . On June 10 , 2006 , he played in the 2006 World Cup contest against Trinidad and Tobago . He also played four games in the Euro 2008 qualifiers , in which he kept a vital clean sheet against Spain national football team , and was also a member of the nation 's final stage squad . Shaaban had a possibility to choose Finland as his national side , but decided to represent Sweden because at that time Finland had many strong national team goalkeepers . In 2007 , he lost the position as 1st goalkeeper as Andreas Isaksson claimed it after joining Manchester City . Shaaban grew up in Solna , Stockholm with a Finnish mother and an Egyptian father . As a result , he has both Swedish and Egyptian citizenship . He was raised as a Muslim . In his late teens to early twenties , Shaaban lived in Cairo , where he played football and attended university . Prior to joining Arsenal , he also worked as a mountain explosives specialist . Shaaban has one son , Gabriel , born 2002 to his ex-wife . Several years after his divorce , he began dating a makeup artist named Frida . Although they are not married , the two have a son Noah , born in August 2008 . Shaaban made a move to Hammarby partly to be close to Gabriel . He currently lives in a large lake house with his son and wife . Reporters often credit Shaaban for remaining down-to-earth . Shaaban claims he has friends ranging from sheet metal workers to footballers , such as Fredrik Ljungberg : Ljungberg and Shaaban remain close after becoming friends whilst at Arsenal . The two are often seen drinking coffee together . Shaaban is known for his love of coffee ; he is often seen with a cup of coffee in his hand . He once said , `` I dare not keep count of how many cups I drink per day . But mom is actually even worse . ''

Alexander Peter `` Fats '' Delvecchio ( born December 4 , 1931 ) is a former ice hockey player and member of the Hockey Hall of Fame . After playing a single junior league season for the Oshawa Generals of the OHA ( during which he led the league in assists ) Delvecchio joined the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League for the 1952 season , and helped the team to win the Stanley Cup that year . He would go on to excel both at center and left wing for twenty-two full seasons and parts of two others , and was notable for his spot on the Production line with linemates Gordie Howe and Ted Lindsay . No player in NHL history played more games with just the one team . One of the true gentlemen in the game of hockey , he was a three-time winner of the Lady Byng Trophy for combining good sportsmanship with excellence on the ice . Despite his impressive career , Delvecchio was never the Red Wings ' leading scorer in a season . The closest he ever came was in the 1969 â `` 70 NHL season , where he was just 3 points behind Gordie Howe for the team lead . Following his retirement as a player in 1973 â '' having , at the time , played the second most games and with the second highest assist and point totals in league historyâ '' Delvecchio served two stints as Detroit 's head coach and then as General Manager , until leaving hockey in 1977 to go into business . He was named to the Hockey Hall of Fame in that year . Delvecchio is currently an `` Honored Member '' of the Detroit Red Wings Alumni Association and is active in its efforts to raise money for children 's charities in Metro Detroit . At the time of his retirement , he ranked second in nearly every significant offensive category in Red Wings history behind only Howe . He has since been passed in most of those categories by Steve Yzerman , but still ranks second all-time in games played as a Red Wing .

Lactase ( also known as lactase-phlorizin hydrolase , or LPH ) , a part of the Î - galactosidase family of enzymes , is a glycoside hydrolase involved in the hydrolysis of the disaccharide lactose into constituent galactose and glucose monomers . Lactase is present predominantly along the brush border membrane of the differentiated enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine . In humans , lactase is encoded by the LCT gene . Lactase is essential for digestive hydrolysis of lactose in milk . Deficiency of the enzyme causes lactose intolerance . The optimum temperature for lactase is about 77 Â F ( 25 Â C ) for its activity and has an optimum pH of 6 . Lactase can hydrolyze a variety of substrates . While it is most notably a member of the Î - galactosidase enzymatic class , lactase also has glucosidase and glycosylceramidase activity . In metabolism , the Î - glycosidic bond in D-lactose is hydrolyzed to form D-galactose and D-glucose , which can be absorbed through the intestinal walls and into the bloodstream . The overall reaction that lactase catalyzes is C12H22O11 + H2O â ' C6H12O6 + C6H12O6 + heat . Lactase also catalyzes the conversion of phlorizin to phloretin and glucose . The catalytic mechanism of D-lactose hydrolysis retains the substrate anomeric configuration in the products . While the details of the mechanism are uncertain , the stereochemical retention is achieved through a double displacement reaction . Studies of E. coli lactase have proposed that hydrolysis is initiated when a glutamate nucleophile on the enzyme attacks from the axial side of the galactosyl carbon in the Î - glycosidic bond . The removal of the D-glucose leaving group may be facilitated by Mg-dependent acid catalysis . The enzyme is liberated from the Î - galactosyl moiety upon equatorial nucleophilic attack by water , which produces D-galactose . The prodomain has been shown to act as an intramolecular chaperone in the ER , preventing trypsin cleavage and allowing LPH to adopt the necessary 3-D structure to be transported to the Golgi apparatus . Mature human lactase consists of a single 160 kDa polypeptide chain that localizes to the brush border membrane of intestinal epithelial cells . It is oriented with the N-terminus outside the cell and the C-terminus in the cytosol . LPH contains two catalytic glutamic acid sites . In the human enzyme , the lactase activity has been connected to Glu-1749 while Glu-1273 is the site of phlorizin hydrolase function . Lactase is encoded by a single genetic locus on chromosome 2 . It is expressed exclusively by mammalian small intestine enterocytes and in very low levels in the colon during fetal development . Humans are born with high levels of lactase expression . In most of the worldâ s population , lactase transcription is down-regulated after weaning , resulting in diminished lactase expression in the small intestine . Diminished lactase expression causes the common symptoms of adult-type hypolactasia , or lactose intolerance . Some population segments exhibit lactase persistence resulting from a mutation that is postulated to have occurred 5000-10 ,000 years ago , coinciding with the rise of cattle domestication . This mutation has allowed almost half of the worldâ s population to metabolize lactose without symptoms . Studies have linked the occurrence of lactase persistence to two different single-nucleotide polymorphisms about 14 and 22 kilobases upstream of the 5 â - end of the LPH gene . Both mutations , Câ ' T at position -13910 and Tâ ' A at position -22018 , have been independently linked to lactase persistence . The lactase promoter is 150 base pairs long and is located just upstream of the site of transcription initiation . The sequence is highly conserved in mammals , suggesting that critical cis-transcriptional regulators are located nearby . Cdx-2 , HNF-1 Î , and GATA have been identified as transcription factors . Studies of hypolactasia onset have demonstrated that despite polymorphisms there is little difference in lactase expression in infants , showing that the mutations become increasingly relevant during development . Î t is hypothesized that developmentally-regulated DNA-binding proteins down-regulate transcription or destabilize mRNA transcripts , causing decreased LPH expression after weaning . Lactase produced commercially can be extracted both from yeasts such as Kluyveromyces fragilis and Kluyveromyces lactis and from fungi , such as Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus oryzae . Its primary commercial use is to break down lactose in milk to make it suitable for people with lactose intolerance . However , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has not formally evaluated the effectiveness of these products . Lactase is also used in the manufacture of ice cream . Because glucose and galactose are sweeter than lactose , lactase produces a more pleasant taste . Lactose also crystallizes at the low temperatures of ice cream ; however , its constituent products , glucose and galactose , remain dissolved and contribute to a smoother texture . Lactase is used in the conversion of whey into syrup . Lactase is also used to screen for blue white colonies in the MCS of various plasmid vectors in Escherichia coli or other bacteria .
A Writing Kind of Day : Poems for Young Poets is a young adult book of poetry by Ralph Fletcher , illustrated by April Ward . It was first published in 2005 . A young writer 's experiences are described in twenty seven mostly free verse poems . Topics included are roadkill , Venus Flytraps , a grandmothers senility . Others discuss snow angels , little brothers and `` Ma '' . Sharon R. Strock in her review for Library Media Connection said `` Powerful words . Thinking words . Poetic words . As readers go through Ralph Fletcherâ s book , they step into worlds far awayâ '' worlds found in their imaginations , their memories , and their hearts . '' And that `` the poems are enhanced with equally intriguing b & w photos and drawings that are simple , curious , humorous , and magical . The cover with the only color found in the book doesnâ t match the content , which is disappointing . '' Jennifer Mattson in her review for Booklist said that the poems in the book `` subvert the notion that poetry requires lofty themes and rarified language ; many satire the dry , technical manner in which the genre is often taught , involving rote memorization of forms ( which the narrator imagines getting munched by a poem-gobbler whose ingestion of haiku , cinquains , and sonnets require `` some onomatopoeia \/ to cure diarrhea . '' and that `` some readers may wish for flashier visuals than the understated , black-and-white drawings and photos , but others will find inspiration here to declare , like Fletcher 's confident your writer , that `` poems are not extinct '' . '' Lee Bock in his review for School Library Journal said `` what emerges is a picture of a young writer at work , looking closely at the world , making connections , and seeing the depth and beauty of everyday events and people . Ward 's black-and-white illustrations use a variety of mediums , including pencil , photography , computer-generated images , and ink . Many aspiring poets will see the reflection of their own creative spirits and aspirations in this lovely collection . ''
The 1939 â `` 40 NHL season was the 23rd season for the National Hockey League . Of the league 's seven teams , the Boston Bruins were the best in the 48-game regular season , but the Stanley Cup winners were the New York Rangers , who defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in the best-of-seven final series 4 â `` 2 for their third Stanley Cup in 14 seasons of existence . It would be another 54 years before their fourth . Tragedy struck the Montreal Canadiens when Babe Siebert , named coach of the struggling club , drowned along with his daughter in August . It put a big hole in the Habs defense and the team finished last under Pit Lepine . An all-star benefit was held in Siebert 's memory . The New York Americans , in financial trouble , decided to trade their star left wing Sweeney Schriner to Toronto for Harvey `` Busher '' Jackson , Buzz Boll , Murray Armstrong , and minor-leaguer Jimmy Fowler . Late in the season , they traded Eddie Wiseman and $ 5000 to Boston for Eddie Shore . The Americans then managed to make the playoffs by finishing a poor sixth . They also obtained Charlie Conacher and used him as a defenceman . The first place Boston Bruins had a new coach in Cooney Weiland , their one-time captain , and were once again led by their Kraut Line , Milt Schmidt , Woody Dumart , and Bobby Bauer as they finished 1 â `` 2 â `` 3 in overall league scoring . Unfortunately , the potent three were unable to help the Bruins get past the first round of the playoffs as the Bruins lost in six games to the Rangers . The New York Rangers were coasting in first place and went 19 consecutive games without a loss . They slumped in the second half , though , and Boston edged them out for first place . The first NHL game broadcast on television was between the New York Rangers and Montreal Canadiens on February 25 , 1940 . The game was seen by only 300 people in a small area in the United States . This , though , was not the first ice hockey game broadcast on television . The first broadcast took place in England on 29 October 1938 , in a game between the Harringay Racers and Streatham for the British Naional Tournament trasmitted by BBC Studios . The CBC 's first hockey broadcast was in 1952 between the Montreal Canadiens and Detroit Red Wings . The Boston Bruins were expected to make the Stanley Cup finals after a first overall finish during the regular season riding the shoulders of the `` Kraut Line '' . But the New York Rangers were too much for the Bruins who lost in six and were out-scored 14 to 8 and shut-out twice in the first round . The third seed Toronto Maple Leafs swept the Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Black Hawks en route to the Stanley Cup finals . Series A : Boston Bruins vs. New York Rangers Series B : Chicago Black Hawks vs. Toronto Maple Leafs Series C : New York Americans vs. Detroit Red Wings Series D : Detroit Red Wings vs. Toronto Maple Leafs Toronto Maple Leafs vs. New York Rangers

Iodine pentoxide is the chemical compound with the formula I2O5 . This iodine oxide is the anhydride of iodic acid . It is produced by dehydrating iodic acid at 200 Â C in a stream of dry air : I2O5 is bent with an I-O-I angle of 139.2 Â , but the molecule has no mirror plane so its symmetry is not C2v . The terminal I-O distances are around 1.80 Ã and the bridging I-O distances are around 1.95 Ã This reaction can be used to analyze the concentration of CO in a gaseous sample . I2O5 forms iodyl salts , ( IO2 + ) , with SO3 and S2O6F2 , but iodosyl salts , ( IO + ) , with concentrated sulfuric acid .
Boulieu-l Ã s-Annonay is a commune in the ArdÃ che department in southern France . Bourg-Saint-And Ã ol is a commune in the ArdÃ che department in the RhÃ ne Valley in southern France . It lies directly along the RhÃ ne River at the southeast end of the department 15 k south of the smaller see of Viviers , 4 k from Pierrelatte eastwards across the river in the dÃ partement DrÃ me and 10 k from Pont-Saint-Esprit , in the north of the dÃ partement of Gard . 14 k to the south-west starts the nearby ArdÃ che Gorges in Saint-Martin-d ` Ard Ã che . The Gallic settlement on a rocky peak over the RhÃ ne river was called Bergoiata . Bourg-Saint-And Ã ol has one of the very rare testimonies of post-roman and pre-Christian religions with its sculpted bas relief of God Mithra . It acquired its present name after Saint Andeolus , the ` apostle of the Vivarais ' , a disciple of St. Polycarp , supposedly arriving from Minor Asia , who evangelized the area under Emperor Septimius Severus , and was martyred in 208 . The region was named Helvia in Julius Caesar 's De Bello Gallico , with Alba-la-Romaine as capital city , then Vivarais from the mediaeval times after the see of Viviers , a region of Languedoc province during Ancient Regime until dÃ partements were created at the French Revolution . Due to the citizen 's engagement for the Revolution , the town 's name rejected a while the quite whimmy saint and was named Bourg-sur-Rh Ã ne . ( At the Napoleonic times , AndÃ ol had already been brought in back ... ) It had been the seat of a bailli ( royal magistrate ) . And the bishop of Viviers had settled several decades in Renaissance times in the city ( the Bishops ' Palace ) . It is the seat of the mother houses of the Congregation of the Presentation of Mary and of the Religious Congregations of the Presentation . The city had grown and become one of the most important towns of county Vivarais due to its position on the RhÃ ne river ( boatmen mariniers du RhÃ ne , trade and business in hide , fabric , wine , oil ) . Several patricians ' houses are still to be seen in the center of the city ( although a part of it was bombed by Allied forces at the end of World War II , missing the hanging bridge - which was replaced afterwards by the existing one ) . Bourg-Saint-And Ã ol is the shopping center for surrounding villages . In the mid 80es , several factories closed and economy almost drowned ( ceramics ) . Nowadays , Pierrelatte with the site of Tricastin , first atomic energy plant in France , makes that many residents of Bourg-Saint-And Ã ol earn their livelihood by working over the RhÃ ne . Another noticeable economical source of the are - already a typical mediterranean zone - is wine , with the CÃ tes du RhÃ ne mÃ ridionales ( southern ) gathering four other communes around the city ( Saint-Marcel-d ` Ard Ã che , Saint-Just and Saint-Martin-d ` Ard Ã che ) . An oil mill has been recently re-established for olive harvests in the area . The area is popular for tourism and summer homes , and the city is known as the richest patrimonial city in ArdÃ che : there are many dolmens in the Bois du Laoul forest and a sculpture of Mithra near the Vauclusian springs of the Tourne .
The Vaige forms part of the commune 's north-western border , flows southwards through the middle of the commune , then flows into the Sarthe River in the town of SablÃ - sur-Sarthe .
Kate Greenaway ( Catherine Greenaway ) ( 17 March 1846 â `` 6 November 1901 ) was an English children 's book illustrator and writer . She studied at what is now the Royal College of Art in London , which at that time had a separate section for women , and was headed by Richard Burchett . Her first book , Under the Window ( 1879 ) , a collection of simple , perfectly idyllic verses about children , was a best-seller . Her paintings were reproduced by chromoxylography , by which the colors were printed from hand-engraved wood blocks by the firm of Edmund Evans . Through the 1880s and 90s , in popularity her only rivals in the field of children 's book illustration were Walter Crane and Randolph Caldecott , himself also the eponym of a highly regarded prize medal . `` Kate Greenaway '' children , all of them little girls and boys too young to be put in trousers , according to the conventions of the time , were dressed in her own versions of late eighteenth century and Regency fashions : smock-frocks and skeleton suits for boys , high-waisted pinafores and dresses with mobcaps and straw bonnets for girls . The influence of children 's clothes in portraits by British painter John Hoppner ( 1758 â `` 1810 ) may have provided her some inspiration . Liberty of London adapted Kate Greenaway 's drawings as designs for actual children 's clothes . A full generation of mothers in the liberal-minded `` artistic '' British circles who called themselves `` The Souls '' and embraced the Arts and Crafts movement dressed their daughters in Kate Greenaway pantaloons and bonnets in the 1880s and '90s . She was elected to membership of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1889 . She lived in an arts and crafts house she commissioned from Richard Norman Shaw in Frognal , London , although she spent summers in the small Nottinghamshire village of Rolleston , near Southwell . Greenaway died of breast cancer in 1901 at the age of 55 . She is buried in Hampstead Cemetery , London . The Kate Greenaway Medal , established in her honor in 1955 , is awarded annually by the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals in the UK to an illustrator of children 's books .
JÃ rg Heinrich ( born December 6 , 1969 in Rathenow ) is a German football defender . After spells with various small clubs in East Germany , Heinrich joined amateur side Kickers Emden in the summer of 1990 and played for the club in the following four seasons , three of which were in the third division . In the summer of 1994 , he left Kickers Emden for Bundesliga side SC Freiburg and started his professional career at the club . He made his Bundesliga debut on August 20 , 1994 as a second-half substitute in SC Freiburg 's opening match of the 1994-95 Bundesliga season , a 2-0 defeat away against Karlsruher SC . He went on to become a regular in the Freiburg team during his first season with the club and appeared in 33 out of possible 34 Bundesliga matches that season , also scoring seven goals for the club in the league and helping the team to a surprising third-place finish in the Bundesliga that season . He scored his first Bundesliga goal already in his second appearance for SC Freiburg in the league , netting the final goal in the club 's surprising 5-1 home victory over FC Bayern Munich . He appeared in another eight Bundesliga matches for SC Freiburg in the following season and went on to leave the club for Borussia Dortmund in January 1996 . He went on to appear for Borussia Dortmund in all 17 Bundesliga matches until the end of the 1995-96 season and also won the Bundesliga champions title with the club that season . He was also a regular in the following two seasons , appearing in 64 out of possible 68 Bundesliga matches . He scored 11 Bundesliga goals for Borussia Dortmund in two and half seasons with the club . In 1997 , he also won the UEFA Champions League with Borussia Dortmund , playing all 90 minutes in their 3-1 victory over Juventus Turin in the Final . In the summer of 1998 , Heinrich moved to Italian club ACF Fiorentina and continued to play there in the following two seasons before returning to Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2000 . In two seasons with Fiorentina , he made 57 Serie A appearances and scored five goals for the club in the league . He subsequently played three seasons for Borussia Dortmund , but was a regular only in the first of these three seasons . In 2002 , he won another Bundesliga champions title with the club . Between 2000 and 2003 , Heinrich made 63 Bundesliga appearances for Borussia Dortmund and scored seven goals for the club in the league . He also participated with Borussia Dortmund in the 2002-03 UEFA Champions League season and made seven appearances in the competition . In the summer of 2003 , Heinrich left Borussia Dortmund for 1 . FC KÃ ln and appeared in 20 Bundesliga matches for the club in the following season before finishing his professional career in the spring of 2004 . He played his last Bundesliga match in 1 . FC KÃ ln 's 3-0 defeat away against SC Freiburg , his first professional club , on March 27 , 2004 . After retiring from professional football , he continued to play as an amateur in the fourth-division Oberliga NOFV-Nord , spending one season with Ludwigsfelder FC and one half-season with 1 . FC Union Berlin , where he finished his playing career in December 2005 and continued to work for the club as their sports director . Since August 2006 , he also plays occasionally for fifth-division side TSV Chemie Premnitz . Heinrich was also a member of the German national team between 1995 and 2002 , winning 37 international caps and scoring two goals for the team . He made his international debut in Germany 's friendly match against Italy on June 21 , 1995 . He was a member of the German squad at the 1998 World Cup finals in France and appeared in all five matches before the team was surprisingly eliminated by Croatia in the quarterfinals . He also appeared for Germany in all of their three matches at the disappointing 1999 Confederations Cup in Mexico , where the team was eliminated in the group stage .

Toxicology ( from the Greek words Ï Î Î 3\/4 Î Î Ï Ï - toxicos `` poisonous '' and logos ) is a branch of biology , chemistry , and medicine concerned with the study of the adverse effects of chemicals on living organisms . It is the study of symptoms , mechanisms , treatments and detection of poisoning , especially the poisoning of people . Dioscorides , a Greek physician in the court of the Roman emperor Nero , made the first attempt to classify plants according to their toxic and therapeutic effect . Ibn Wahshiya wrote the Book on Poisons in the 9th or 10th century . Mathieu Orfila is considered to be the modern father of toxicology , having given the subject its first formal treatment in 1813 in his TraitÃ des poisons , also called Toxicologie gÃ nÃ rale . Theophrastus Phillipus Auroleus Bombastus von Hohenheim ( 1493 â `` 1541 ) ( also referred to as Paracelsus , from his belief that his studies were above or beyond the work of Celsus - a Roman physician from the first century ) is also considered `` the father '' of toxicology . He is credited with the classic toxicology maxim , `` Alle Dinge sind Gift und nichts ist ohne Gift ; allein die Dosis macht , dass ein Ding kein Gift ist . '' which translates as , `` All things are poison and nothing is without poison ; only the dose makes a thing not a poison . '' This is often condensed to : `` The dose makes the poison '' or in Latin `` Sola dosis facit venenum '' . The relationship between dose and its effects on the exposed organism is of high significance in toxicology . The chief criterion regarding the toxicity of a chemical is the dose , i.e. the amount of exposure to the substance . All substances are toxic under the right conditions . The term refers to the dose of a toxic substance that kills 50 percent of a test population ( typically rats or other surrogates when the test concerns human toxicity ) . LD50 estimations in animals are no longer required for regulatory submissions as a part of pre-clinical development package . The conventional relationship ( more exposure equals higher risk ) has been challenged in the study of endocrine disruptors . Many substances regarded as poisons are toxic only indirectly . An example is `` wood alcohol , '' or methanol , which is chemically converted to formaldehyde and formic acid in the liver . It is the formaldehyde and formic acid that cause the toxic effects of methanol exposure . As for drugs , many small molecules are made toxic in the liver , a good example being acetaminophen ( paracetamol ) , especially in the presence of chronic alcohol use . The genetic variability of certain liver enzymes makes the toxicity of many compounds differ between one individual and the next . Because demands placed on one liver enzyme can induce activity in another , many molecules become toxic only in combination with others . A family of activities that many toxicologists engage includes identifying which liver enzymes convert a molecule into a poison , what are the toxic products of the conversion and under what conditions and in which individuals this conversion takes place . There are various specialized subdisciplines within the field of toxicology that concern diverse chemical and biological aspects of this area . For example , toxicogenomics involves applying molecular profiling approaches to the study of toxicology . Other areas include Aquatic toxicology , Chemical toxicology , Ecotoxicology , Environmental toxicology , Forensic toxicology , and Medical toxicology . Chemical toxicology is a scientific discipline involving the study of structure and mechanism related to the toxic effects of chemical agents , and encompasses technology advances in research related to chemical aspects of toxicology . Research in this area is strongly multidisciplinary , spanning computational chemistry and synthetic chemistry , proteomics and metabolomics , drug discovery , drug metabolism and mechanisms of action , bioinformatics , bioanalytical chemistry , chemical biology , and molecular epidemiology .
29 Amphitrite ( , or as in ) is one of the largest S-type asteroids , probably third in diameter after Eunomia and Juno , although Iris and Herculina are similar in size . Amphitrite was discovered by Albert Marth on March 1 , 1854 , at the private South Villa Observatory , in Regent 's Park , London . It was Marth 's only asteroid discovery . Its name was chosen by George Bishop , the owner of the observatory , who named it after Amphitrite , a sea goddess in Greek mythology . Amphirite 's orbit is less eccentric and inclined than those of its larger cousins ; indeed , it is the most circular of any asteroid discovered up to that point . As a consequence , it never becomes as bright as Iris or Hebe , especially as it is much further from the Sun than those asteroids . It can reach magnitudes of around +8.6 at a favorable opposition , but usually is around the binocular limit of +9.5 . In 2007 , James Baer and Steven R. Chesley estimated Amphitrite to have a mass of 1.9 kg . A more recent estimate by Baer suggests it has a mass of 1.18 kg . A satellite of the asteroid is suspected to be based on lightcurve datacollected by Edward F. Tedesco .
Random forest ( or random forests ) is an ensemble classifier that consists of many decision trees and outputs the class that is the mode of the class 's output by individual trees . The algorithm for inducing a random forest was developed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler , and `` Random Forests '' is their trademark . The term came from random decision forests that was first proposed by Tin Kam Ho of Bell Labs in 1995 . The method combines Breiman 's `` bagging '' idea and the random selection of features , introduced independently by Ho and Amit and Geman in order to construct a collection of decision trees with controlled variation . The selection of a random subset of features is an example of the random subspace method , which , in Ho 's formulation , is a way to implement stochastic discrimination proposed by Eugene Kleinberg .

Michael James Grier ( born January 5 , 1975 in Detroit , Michigan ) is a professional ice hockey forward who currently plays for the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . He has also played professionally for the Edmonton Oilers , Washington Capitals , and San Jose Sharks . With the 1996 â `` 97 season , Grier became the NHL 's first African-American player born and trained in the United States . His father is Bobby Grier , who is the Associate Director of Pro Personnel for the Houston Texans of the National Football League ( NFL ) . Prior to that , Bobby Grier was a running back coach , director of pro scouting , and vice-president of player personnel for the New England Patriots of the NFL . ( The elder Grier is not to be confused with Bobby Grier who broke the color barrier in the 1956 Sugar Bowl . ) Mike 's brother is Chris Grier , Director of College Scouting for the Miami Dolphins . Another notable athlete in his family is Pro Bowl NFL Defensive Lineman Roosevelt `` Rosey '' Grier . Grier was raised in the Boston area , where he attended and played hockey at St. Sebastian 's School . Grier was originally drafted by the St. Louis Blues in the ninth round ( 219th overall ) of the 1993 NHL Entry Draft , and was considered a long-shot to make an NHL team . He spent his early playing days with Saint Sebastian 's School and later with Boston University , culminating in his best amateur season in 1994 â `` 95 , where he was named a first team all-star . During his time at BU , Grier 's NHL rights were dealt to the Edmonton Oilers along with star goaltender Curtis Joseph in exchange for a pair of first round picks . After leaving college , Grier immediately cracked the Oilers lineup as a checking-line right-winger , scoring 32 points and bearing a respectable +7 plus-minus rating . During his time in Edmonton , Grier was best known for provoking Chris Simon of the Washington Capitals in 1997 . Grier made derogatory comments about Simon 's Ojibwa heritage , and Simon allegedly responded with a racial slur directed at Grier , and struck him in the head with his stick . Although the spoken words were never confirmed , Simon was suspended three games as a result of the incident . Grier played six seasons with the Oilers organization , including two in which he scored twenty goals . On October 2 , 2002 , in order to free up roster space , Grier was traded to the Washington Capitals for a pair of draft choices . Incidentally , this put Grier and Simon on the same team for a short time ; however , Simon was traded to Chicago after playing 10 games in the 2002 â `` 03 season . The Capitals attempted to put a Stanley Cup-caliber team together , primarily built around star forward JaromÃ r JÃ gr and goaltender Olaf KÃ lzig . The team disappointed on the ice , although Grier remained a reliable checking player . Washington traded Grier on March 4 , 2004 to the Buffalo Sabres for Czech prospect Jakub KlepiÅ . Grier finished the season with Buffalo , scoring nine points , but the Sabres failed to make the playoffs . During the 2005 â `` 06 NHL season , Grier set a personal record , scoring four game winning goals for the Sabres and contributing to their run to the 2006 Eastern Conference Finals . Grier was then signed to a free agent deal by the San Jose Sharks , where he recorded 16 goals , including three shorthanded , in his first season with San Jose . He scored nine and 10 goals in his next two seasons with the Sharks , respectively . On August 10 , 2009 , Grier signed with the Buffalo Sabres . Grier 's biggest contribution to the San Jose Sharks and Buffalo Sabres has been his penalty killing ability . San Jose ranked 14th , 1st , and 4th in penalty killing in the three years Grier played with the team . In the 2009 â `` 10 season , Buffalo was second overall in the NHL in penalty killing . Grier has been a part of the top penalty killing units for these teams . Grier is also known for his toughness , separating his shoulder and having it popped back in on numerous occasions before finally electing for surgery . Grier played his 1000th NHL game on November 3 , 2010 , against the Boston Bruins , becoming the 254th player in NHL history to reach the milestone .

Andorra la Vella ( , locally : ) is the capital of the Co-principality of Andorra , and is located high in the east Pyrenees between France and Spain . It is also the name of the parish that surrounds the capital . The principal industry is tourism , although the country also earns foreign income from being a tax-haven . Furniture and brandies are local products . Andorra la Vella is located in the south west of Andorra , at , at the confluence of two mountain streams , the Valira del Nord and the Valira del Orient , which join to form the Gran Valira . It adjoins the urban area of Escaldes-Engordany . Being at an elevation of 1023 m , it is the highest capital city in Europe and a popular ski resort . It has a temperate climate with cold winters and warm , drier summers . Temperatures range from an average of around -1 C in January to around 20 C in July ; there is 808 m of precipitation a year . The site of Andorra la Vella ( literally , `` Andorra the Old '' ) has been settled since prior to the Christian era â '' notably by the Andosin tribe from the late Neolithic . The state is one of the Marca Hispanica created and protected by Charlemagne in the eighth century as a buffer from the Moorish settlers in the Iberian Peninsula . The settlement of Andorra la Vella has been the principal city of Andorra since 1278 when the French and the Episcopal co-princes agreed to joint suzerainty . Andorra La Vella 's old town â '' the Barri Antic â '' includes streets and buildings dating from this time . Its most notable building is the Casa de la Vall â '' constructed in the early sixteenth century â '' which has been the state 's parliamentary house since 1702 . Andorra la Vella was , during this period , the capital of a largely isolated and feudal state , which retained its independence due to this principle of co-sovereignty . Well into the twentieth century , the area around Andorra La Vella remained largely forgotten ; indeed the state was not part of the Treaty of Versailles , simply because it was not noticed . After political turmoil in the 1930s and an attempted coup by Boris Skossyreff , an informal democracy developed . In 1993 , the country 's first constitution formalised this parliamentary democracy with executive , legislative , and judicial branches located in Andorra la Vella . During this period , Andorra also developed as a tax haven , resulting in the construction of modern banking offices in Andorra La Vella . The city also developed its skiing facilities , to the extent that Andorra la Vella was Andorra 's applicant city for the XXI Olympic Winter Games , the 2010 Winter Olympics . However , Andorra la Vella was not selected by the IOC as a candidate city , following the evaluation report of an IOC commission . It also hosted both the 1991 and 2005 Games of the Small States of Europe . The parish of Andorra la Vella is divided into the villages of Andorra la Vella itself , La Margineda and Santa Coloma . Surprisingly for a capital city , it is three hours ' drive from the nearest airports at Toulouse ( Tolosa in Occitan ) , Girona , Perpignan ( PerpinyÃ ) and Barcelona . This is a result of its small population size and highly mountainous terrain . It also has no train station , although there is a bus service linking the city to the French train station at L'Hospitalet-pr Ã s-l ` Andorre , which has mainline services to Paris and also to the airport of El Prat of Barcelona . Native Andorrans , who are ethnically Catalan , account for only a third ( 33 % ) of the population , with the plurality being Spanish ( 43 % ) , and notable minorities of Portuguese ( 11 % ) and French ( 7 % ) . Catalan is the official language , although Spanish , Portuguese and French are also spoken . Most of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics , with a high life expectancy of over 80 years . The city 's old town is characterized by old stone streets and houses . The central EsglÃ sia de Sant Esteve ( Saint Stephen ) church is part of the area that guidebooks often label as a picturesque part of the city . This was built in a Romanesque style in the eleventh century . As mentioned earlier , the old town also includes the country 's historic parliament building . Probably the oldest building in the city is another church , dating from the ninth century , of Santa Coloma . The city is the country 's cultural center , with the Government Exhibition Hall acting as a main theater and museum . The piazza outside the parliament building is also the location of a number of events , and the town hosts a music festival every winter . Andorra la Vella is the country 's commercial center . In the country as a whole , 80 % of the GDP is derived from the 10 million tourists who visit annually . The city is also the center for the many banks and businesses that thrive from its tax haven status . The state is not a member of the European Union , but has a customs arrangement with the EU , and uses the Euro .
Brian Elliott ( born April 9 , 1985 ) is a Canadian ice hockey goaltender currently playing for the Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League . He was drafted by the Senators in the ninth round of the 2003 NHL Entry Draft , 291st overall . He went on to play 4 seasons for the University of Wisconsinâ `` Madison . Elliott grew up in Newmarket , Ontario playing minor hockey for the Newmarket Redmen AA and the York-Simcoe Express AAA teams in the OMHA . Elliott was not drafted by an OHL team in 2001 and returned to York-Simcoe for Major Midget the following season . After a good season in the Eastern AAA League , Elliott was signed by the Ajax Axemen Jr. . A. team in 2002-03 . After a standout season with the Ajax Axemen in 2002 â `` 03 , Elliott was drafted late in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft by the Ottawa Senators . The second last player selected ( 291st overall ) , Elliott was not expected to progress to the NHL . He would spend four seasons with the University of Wisconsinâ `` Madison , serving as a backup for his first two seasons before securing the starting goaltender position in 2005 â `` 06 . He was selected as a finalist for the 2005 â `` 06 Hobey Baker Memorial Award , collecting eight shutouts in 33 appearances , and leading the Badgers to the 2006 NCAA National Championship . He was signed by the AHL 's Binghamton Senators on March 23 , 2007 , and played in eight games with Binghamton near the end of the 2006 â `` 07 season . Elliott was invited to the Ottawa Senators ' 2007 â `` 08 training camp , but was ultimately assigned to Binghamton on September 25 , 2007 . He was recalled to Ottawa four days later to back up Martin Gerber , as starting goaltender Ray Emery was recovering from wrist surgery . On October 10 , Elliott played in his first NHL game and earned the win against the Atlanta Thrashers . Upon Emery 's return , Elliott was sent back to Binghamton , where he played in 44 games that season . On January 9 , 2009 , Elliott was recalled by Ottawa after being named the AHL 's `` Goalie of the Month '' for December . He had been a standout in Binghamton , posting an 18-8-1 record with a 2.31 goals against average and .926 save percentage . His play earned him the starting position for the Canadian team in the 2009 AHL All-Star Game . Elliott made an immediate impact in Ottawa . The team had struggled all season , with inconsistent goaltending being an issue . Craig Hartsburg , Ottawa 's head coach at the time , said of the move `` We need some saves , some big saves , and he 's done it down there ( Binghamton ) '' . Elliott would finish the season in Ottawa , sharing goaltending duties with veteran Alex Auld . Elliott 's emergence made Martin Gerber expendable , and he would be claimed on waivers by the Toronto Maple Leafs . Elliott was nominated for the NHL 's `` Rookie of the Month '' award for March 2009 , though he would lose out to Blues ' forward T.J. Oshie . In January 2010 , he was awarded the National Hockey League 's `` First Star '' for the week of January 18-24 , and named the league 's `` Second Star '' the week of January 25-31 . Prior to the trade deadline of the 2010 â `` 11 season Elliott was traded as a part of Ottawa 's rebuilding process to the Colorado Avalanche on February 18 , 2011 in exchange for goaltender Craig Anderson .
This is about a Chinese custom . See also Janus the Roman god of doors . A door god is a Chinese decoration placed on each side of an entry to a temple , home , business , etc. , which is believed to keep evil spirits from entering . `` The custom dates back to the Tang Dynasty , whose founder Emperor Tang Taizong ( 599 - May 26 , 649 ) honored two of his most loyal generals -- Qin Shubao and Yuchi Jingde -- by having their painted portraits hung on his front door . Ordinary families soon adopted the imperial custom , putting woodblock prints of the ever-vigilant generals on their front gates in the hope of attracting good luck and fending off evil spirits . The Door God business soon spread throughout China , adding other folklore heroes and mythological figures to the repertoire . '' The door gods usually come in pairs , facing each other ; it is considered bad luck to place the figures back-to-back . There are several different forms of door gods . The most frequently used are Qin Shubao and Yuchi Jingde ( used on a pair of doors ) . The poster depicting Wei Zheng or Zhong Kui are used on single doors . Qin Qiong ( also known as Qin Shubao ) has pale skin and usually carries swords ; Yuchi Gong ( also known as Yuchi Jingde ) has dark skin and usually carries batons . Qin and Yuchi , in a Tang dynasty legend , were told by the emperor to guard the door because of a ghost harassing him , thus resulting in sleepless nights . When Qin and Yuchi were called , they guarded the emperor 's door . Thus , the emperor had a blissful sleep . The next day , the emperor , not wanting to trouble his two generals , called on men to hang portraits of the two men on either side of his door . Shen shu and Yu lei carry a battle axe and a mace , respectively . Shen shu and Yu lei were immortals who were ordered by the Jade Emperor to guard peach trees which demons were gnawing at . The people of China thus respected the two immortals for their ability to ward off demons . Zhong kui - strictly speaking is not a Door God but a mythical exorcist ( ghost catcher ) ; nonetheless his image is often displayed as the `` backdoor general '' . The practice of placing door god figures is fading as of late , after a brief revival in the 1980s . In the novel Journey to the West a fictional account of Li Shimin 's invention of the Door god is mentioned .

A music festival is a festival oriented towards music that is sometimes presented with a theme such as musical genre , nationality or locality of musicians , or holiday . They are commonly held outdoors , and are often inclusive of other attractions such as food and merchandise vending machines , performance art , and social activities . The Pythian Games at Delphi included musical performances , and may be one of the earliest festivals known . During the Middle Ages festivals were often held as competitions . Many festivals are annual , or repeat at some other interval . Some , including many rock festivals , are held only once . Some festivals are organized as for-profit concerts and others are benefits for a specific cause . Another type of music festival is the educative type , organised annually in local communities , regionally or nationally , for the benefit of amateur musicians of all ages and grades of achievement . While entrants perform prepared pieces in the presence of an audience which includes competitors , the essential feature of this type of festival is that each participant receives verbal and written feedback , there and then , from a highly qualified , professional adjudicator â '' someone who they might never meet in any other way . They also usually receive a certificate , classified according to merit , and some may win trophies . The competitive element is often played down , however , as the important aspect is that participants can learn from one another . Such festivals aim to provide a friendly and supportive platform for musicians to share in the excitement of making music . For many they provide a bridge between lessons & examinations and performing confidently in public . The world 's largest music festival is Summerfest , which is held for eleven days every year in Milwaukee , Wisconsin . Each year , it attracts between 800,000 and 1,000,000 spectators .

It is on the Carrione River , some 100 kilometres ( 62 miles ) west-northwest of Florence . Its motto is Fortitudo mea in rota ( Latin for `` My force is in the wheel '' ) . There are known settlements in the area as early as the 9th century BC , when the Apuan Ligures lived in the region . The current town originated from the borough built to house workers in the marble quarries created by the Romans after their conquest of Liguria in the early 2nd century BC . In the Middle Ages it was a Byzantine and Lombard possession , and then , it was under bishops of Luni , turning itself into an autonomous commune in the early 13th century ; during the struggle between Guelphs and Ghibellines , Carrara usually belonged to the latter party . The Bishops acquired it again in 1230 , their rule ending in 1313 , when the city was given in succession to the Republics of Pisa , Lucca and Florence . Later it was acquired by Gian Galeazzo Visconti of Milan . After the death of Filippo Maria Visconti of Milan in 1477 , Carrara was fought over by Tommaso Campofregoso , lord of Sarzana , and again the Malaspina family , who moved here the seat of their signoria in the second half of the 16th century . Carrara and Massa formed the Duchy of Massa and Carrara from the 15th to the 19th century . Under the last Malaspina , Maria Teresa , who had married Ercole III d'Este , it became part of the Duchy of Modena . After the short Napoleonic rule of Elisa Bonaparte , it was given back to Modena . During the unification of Italy age , Carrara was the seat of a popular revolt led by Domenico Cucchiari , and was a center of Giuseppe Mazzini 's revolutionary activity . The quarry workers , including the stone carvers , had radical beliefs that set them apart from others . Ideas from outside the city began to influence the Carrarese . Anarchism and general radicalism became part of the heritage of the stone carvers . According to a New York Times article of 1894 many violent revolutionists who had been expelled from Belgium and Switzerland went to Carrara in 1885 and founded the first anarchist group in Italy . The district in which the quarries are situated was consequently the original hotbed of anarchism in Italy . Carrara has remained a continuous ` hotbed ' of anarchism in Italy , with several organizations located openly in the city . The Anarchist marble workers were also the driving force behind organising labor in the quarries and in the carving sheds . In 1929 , the municipalities of Carrara , Massa and Montignoso were merged in a single municipality , called Apuania . In 1945 the previous situation was restored . Carrara is the birthplace of the International Federation of Anarchists ( IFA ) , formed in 1968 . Carrara marble has been used since the time of Ancient Rome ; the Pantheon and Trajan 's Column in Rome are constructed of it . Many sculptures of the Renaissance , such as Michelangelo 's David , were carved from Carrara marble . For Michelangelo at least , Carrara marble was valued above all other stone , except perhaps that of his own quarry in Pietrasanta . The Marble Arch in London and the Duomo di Siena are also made from this stone , as are the interiors of Manila Cathedral and the cold-white marbles of the Sheikh Zayed Mosque . The statue to Robert Burns which commands a central position in Dumfries was carved in Carrara by Italian craftsmen working to Amelia Paton Hill 's model . It was unveiled by future UK Prime Minister , Archibald Primrose , 5th Earl of Rosebery on 6 April 1882 . In addition to the marble quarries , the city has academies of sculpture and fine arts and a museum of statuaries and antiquities , and a yearly marble technology fair . The local marble is exported around the world , and marble from elsewhere is also fashioned and sculpted commercially here . The word `` Carrara '' likely comes from the ancient term `` Kar '' ( stone ) . Ancient Romans quarried the marble , loaded it onto ships at the port of Luni and took it to Rome . According to Saint Girolamo , the name Carrara derives from â carâ which means `` wagons '' and from â iaraâ that means `` Moon '' , so is the â City of the Moon on the Wagonsâ . Another hypothesis ( Repetti ) is that the term is derived from the French â careersâ , which in turn is borrowed from â carrariaeâ , a Latin term meaning quarry . Carrara may derive from a preroman term : â kairâ ( Celtic ) or to one from Liguria : â karâ , that means `` stone '' and therefore : â car + ariaâ meaning â place of stonesâ . The Carrarese have a long tradition of independence that can be described as anarchism .

As of the census of 2000 , there were 237 people , 79 households , and 51 families residing in the city . The population density was 11.3 people per square mile ( 4.4 \/ kmÂ ) . There were 111 housing units at an average density of 5.3 per square mile ( 2.0 \/ kmÂ ) . The racial makeup of the city was 13.08 % White , 73.00 % Native American , and 13.92 % from two or more races . There were 79 households out of which 44.3 % had children under the age of 18 living with them , 32.9 % were married couples living together , 13.9 % had a female householder with no husband present , and 34.2 % were non-families . 26.6 % of all households were made up of individuals and 3.8 % had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older . The average household size was 3.00 and the average family size was 3.60 . In the city the age distribution of the population shows 39.7 % under the age of 18 , 7.6 % from 18 to 24 , 29.5 % from 25 to 44 , 19.0 % from 45 to 64 , and 4.2 % who were 65 years of age or older .

rlogin is a software utility for Unix-like computer operating systems that allows users to log in on another host via a network , communicating via TCP port 513 . It was first distributed as part of the 4.2 BSD release . rlogin is also the name of the application layer protocol used by the software , part of the TCP\/IP protocol suite . Authenticated users can act as if they were physically present at the computer . RFC 1282 , in which it was defined , states that : `` The rlogin facility provides a remote-echoed , locally flow-controlled virtual terminal with proper flushing of output . '' rlogin communicates with a daemon , rlogind , on the remote host . rlogin is similar to the Telnet command , but has the disadvantage of not being as customizable and being able to connect only to Unix hosts . rlogin is most commonly deployed on corporate or academic networks , where user account information is shared between all the Unix machines on the network ( often using NIS ) . These deployments essentially trust most other machines ( and the network infrastructure itself ) and the rlogin protocol relies on this trust . rlogind allows logins without password ( where rlogind trusts a remote rlogin client ) if the remote host appears in the \/ etc\/hosts . equiv file , or if the user in question has a . rhosts file in their home directory ( which is frequently shared using NFS ) . Due to these serious problems rlogin was rarely used across untrusted networks ( like the public internet ) and even in closed deployments it has fallen into relative disuse ( with many Unix and Linux distributions no longer including it by default ) . Many networks which formerly relied on rlogin and telnet have replaced it with SSH and its rlogin-equivalent slogin . The original Berkeley package which provides rlogin also features rcp ( remote-copy , allowing files to be copied over the network ) and rsh ( remote-shell , allowing commands to be run on a remote machine without the user logging into it ) . These share the hosts . equiv and . rhosts access-control scheme ( although they connect to a different daemon , rshd ) , and as such suffer from the same security problems . The ssh suite contains suitable replacements for both : scp replaces rcp , and ssh itself replaces both rlogin and rsh .
Year 22 ( XXII ) was a common year starting on Thursday ( link will display the full calendar ) of the Julian calendar . At the time , it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Agrippa and Galba ( or , less frequently , year 775 Ab urbe condita ) . The denomination 22 for this year has been used since the early medieval period , when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years .

Riau Islands Province ( ( Kepri or Kepulauan Riau ) is a province of Indonesia , consisting of the Riau Archipelago , the Tudjuh Archipelago , and the Lingga Islands . Originally part of the Riau Province , the Riau Islands were split off as a separate province in July 2004 , with Tanjung Pinang as its capital , located at south of Bintan island . The islands of the Tudjuh Archipelago , located between mainland Malaysia and Borneo , were attached to the new province , although they were not geographically part of the Riau Archipelago . The major island groups are the Riau Archipelago off of Singapore , the Lingga Islands extending southward of the Riau Arch . , parallel the Sumatran Coast , and the Tudjuh Archipelago . Batam has a majority of the province 's population . Other populated major islands include Bintan and Karimun . Sizewise , however , the sparsely populated Natuna Islands are larger . There are around 3,200 islands in the province . Since Batam is part of a booming special economic region , it has experienced high population growth rates . The province 's population is at 1,685,698 as of 2010 , with more than 2\/3 of the population under 30 . The official language of the Riau Islands is Riau . The Riau Islands are considered the birthplace of the modern Malay language . It is the official standard for Malay , as agreed upon by Indonesia , Malaysia and Brunei . From Srivijayan times until the 16th century , Riau was a natural part of greater Malay kingdoms or sultanates , in the heart of what is often called the Malay World , which stretches from eastern Sumatra to Borneo . The Malay-related Orang Laut tribes inhabited the islands and formed the backbone of most Malay kingdoms from Srivijaya to the Sultanate of Johor for the control of trade routes going through the straits . After the fall of Melaka in 1511 , the Riau islands became the center of political power of the mighty Sultanate of Johor or Johor-Riau , based on Bintan island , and were for long considered the center of Malay culture . But history changed the fate of Riau as a political , cultural or economic center when European powers struggled to control the regional trade routes and took advantage of political weaknesses within the sultanate . Singapore island , that had been for centuries part of the same greater Malay kingdoms and sultanates , and under direct control of the Sultan of Johor , came under control of the British . The creation of a European-controlled territory in the heart of the Johor-Riau natural boundaries broke the sultanate into two parts , destroying the cultural and political unity that had existed for centuries . The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 consolidated this separation , with the British controlling all territories north of the Singapore strait and the Dutch controlling territories from Riau to Java . After the European powers withdrew from the region , the new independent governments had to reorganize and find balance after inheriting 100 years of colonial boundaries . Before finding their current status , the territories of Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore , Brunei and Borneo struggled and even came into military conflict against each other , and the Riau islands once again found themselves in the middle of a regional struggle . The strong cultural unity of the region with Riau in the heart of this region never returned , and the line drawn by the British in 1819 remained , dividing the area into three new countries in 1965 : Singapore , the Malaysian federation in the north , and Indonesia in the south . Some level of unity returned in the Riau region for the first time after 150 years , with the creation of the Sijori Growth Triangle in 1989 . But while bringing back some economical wealth to Riau , the Sijori Growth Triangle somewhat further broke the cultural unity within the islands . With Batam island receiving most of the industrial investments and dramatically developing into a regional industrial center , it attracted hundreds of thousands of non-Malay Indonesian migrants , changing forever the demographic balance in the archipelago . Today the name of Riau merely refers to this administrative region of Indonesia , a free trade zone heavily supported by Indonesian , Singaporean and international investments . There have been various attempts at both independence and autonomy for this part of Indonesia since the founding of Indonesia in 1945 .
The Southern Railway ( SR ) gave the designations 6-PUL , 6-CITY and 6-PAN to electric multiple units built to work the routes between London and Brighton , West Worthing and Eastbourne . None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class number . The 6-PUL units were designated 6-COR until 1935 ( the COR designation was later used for 4-COR units ) . Coach numbers 11001 and 11002 were prototype driving motor brake vehicles for the mainline stock that was being developed for the London to Brighton electrification . The first was built by the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company ( BRCW ) and the second by Metropolitan Cammell Carriage and Wagon Company . Both were introduced in October 1931 , and ran with three trailers converted from former London and South Western Railway carriages as unit number 2001 . After trials with this unit had been completed the set was disbanded , and the two prototype driving cars were reformed into 6-CITY units 2041 and 2042 respectively . Unit number 2001 was then reused for one of the production 6-PUL units . The 6-PUL ( 6-car Pullman stock , numbers 2001 â `` 2020 ) and 6-CITY ( 6-car City stock , numbers 2041 â `` 2043 ) units were built in 1932 to provide high quality accommodation on the newly-electrified London to Brighton route . Units of both types each included a Pullman composite kitchen car , which were built by Metropolitan Cammell and numbered 256 to 278 in the Pullman Car Company series . The 6-CITY units differed from the 6-PUL units only in that the three trailers other than the Pullman car had all first class accommodation . They were dedicated for use on the London Bridge to Brighton route ( as opposed to the London Victoria route on which the 6-PUL units were used ) , and were intended for the trains used by City workers , hence their designation . The 6-PAN ( 6-car Pantry unis , numbers 2021 â `` 2037 ) units were introduced in 1935 , upon the extension of the electrified network to Ore. . They were similar to the 6-PUL units , except that the Pullman car was replaced by a first class dining car with a pantry . From this time , 12-car trains were often formed from a 6-PAN coupled to either a 6-PUL or 6-CITY . Until the arrival of the 6-PAN units , the 6-PUL units had been referred to as 6-COR ( 6-car Corridor stock ) and , as explained below , the designation COR was again used by this stock in later years for various reasons . The numbers of all three types of unit were revised in January 1937 from 20xx to 30xx . Between May 1942 and May 1946 , the Pullman cars in these units were withdrawn and stored at the Pullman workshops in Brighton . This was part of the general withdrawal of Pullman and other restaurant and dining cars from railway stock during World War II . During this period , the 6-PUL and 6-CITY stock were referred to as 5-COR . When the Pullman cars were returned to service , not all were inserted into the same units that they had been in before the war . Those that were reformed were : During 1947 and 1948 , the three 6-CITY units were converted to standard 6-PUL units by reclassifying their three Trailer First vehicles into a Trailer Third ( numbered 10113 â `` 10115 ) and two Trailer Composites ( 11862 â `` 11867 ) . After the 6-PUL and 6-PAN units were disbanded , many of the carriages continued to run in service together with former 4-RES and 4-COR stock . These reformed units were classified either 4-PUL , 4-COR , 4-COR ( N ) , 6-COR or 6-TC . The 6-TC unit was formed in 1965 to trial push-pull equipment that would allow a diesel locomotive to be operated remotely from the driving cab in the multiple unit . It was composed of former 4Cor driving motor cars , which had their motors removed and the end gangways removed , and 6-PAN\/6-PUL trailer cars . At the same time a Class 33 locomotive was modified to work with the unit . From early 1966 , the experimental train was used on the Oxted line , and was later transferred to the Clapham Junction to Kensington Olympia service . The trials were successful , and led to the production of the 3-TC and 4-TC units for working the Bournemouth line with Class 33\/1 locomotives . However , the 6-TC unit had a short life , and was withdrawn after incurring accident damage . After withdrawal from passenger service , the underframes of several PUL and PAN unit carriages were reused by the engineering department as long-welded rail carriers and crane runners . Former 6-PUL Pullman cars 264 Ruth and 278 Bertha have been preserved , and are now used as ordinary locomotive-hauled Pullman cars . Number 264 is part of the Venice Simplon Orient Express fleet , working charter trains on the main line , while 278 is on the Swanage Railway . Former 6-PUL Trailer Composite car , number 11773 , was preserved on the Swanage Railway for many years , but fell into bad condition and has now been scrapped .

Risotto is a class of Italian dishes of rice cooked in broth to a creamy consistency . The broth may be meat-based , fish-based , or vegetable-based ; many kinds include parmesan cheese , butter , and onion . It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in Italy . Risotto is normally a primo ( first course ) , served on its own before the main course , but risotto alla milanese is often served together with ossobuco alla milanese . A high-starch ( amylopectin ) , low-amylose round medium - or short - grain rice is usually used to make risotto . Such rices have the ability to absorb liquids and to release starch and so they are stickier than the long grain varieties . The principal varieties used in Italy are Arborio , Baldo , Carnaroli , Padano , Roma , and Vialone Nano . Carnaroli and Vialone Nano are considered to be the best ( and most expensive ) varieties , with different users preferring one over the other . They have slightly different properties . For example , Carnaroli is less likely than Vialone Nano to get overcooked , but the latter , being smaller , cooks faster and absorbs condiments better . Other varieties like Roma , Baldo , Ribe and Originario may be used but will not have the creaminess of the traditional dish . These varieties are considered better for soups and other non-risotto rice dishes and for making sweet rice desserts . Rice designations of Superfino , Semifino and Fino refer to the size and shape ( specifically the length and the narrowness of the grain ) of the grains , and not the quality . There are many different risotto recipes with different ingredients , but they are all based on rice of an appropriate variety cooked in a standard procedure . The rice is first cooked briefly in a soffritto of onion or garlic and butter or olive oil to coat each grain in a film of fat , this is called tostatura ; white or red wine is added and has to be absorbed by the grains . When it has evaporated , the heat is raised to medium high and very hot stock is gradually added in small amounts while stirring gently , almost constantly : stirring loosens the starch molecules from the outside of the rice grains into the surrounding liquid , creating a smooth creamy-textured liquid . At that point it is taken off the heat for the mantecatura when diced cold butter and finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese are vigorously stirred in to make the texture as creamy and smooth as possible . It may be removed from the heat a few minutes earlier , and left to cook with its residual heat . Seafood risotti generally do not include cheese . Properly cooked risotto is rich and creamy but still with some resistance or bite : al dente , and with separate grains . The traditional texture is fairly fluid , or all ` onda ( `` wavy , or flowing in waves '' ) . It is served on flat dishes and it should easily spread out but not have excess watery liquid around the perimeter . It must be eaten at once as it continues to cook in its own heat and can become too dry with the grains too soft . Risotto can be made using many kinds of vegetable , meat , fish , seafood and legumes , and different types of wine and cheese may be used . There is even , exceptionally , an Italian strawberry risotto . Outside Italy , dishes made in a similar way to true risotto but with different grains or cereals are sometimes called `` risotto '' : `` farro risotto '' , `` barley risotto '' .
A potluck is a gathering of people where each person or group of people contributes a dish of food to be shared among the group . Synonyms include : potluck dinner , spread , Jacob 's join , Jacob 's supper , faith supper , covered dish supper , bring and share , pitch-in , carry-in , bring-a-plate , smorgasbord , dish-to-pass . The word pot-luck appears in 16th century England , in the work of Thomas Nashe , and was there used to mean `` food provided for an unexpected or uninvited guest , the luck of the pot '' . The sense `` communal meal , where guests bring their own food '' , appears to have originated in the late 19th century or early 20th century US , particularly in the Western United States , either by influence from potlatch or possibly by extension of traditional sense of `` luck of the pot '' . To the Irish , a potluck was a meal with no particular menu . Everyone participating brought a dish for all to share . The term comes from a time when groups of Irish women would gather together and cook dinner . They only had one pot so they cooked the meal together with whatever ingredients they happened to have that day . Potluck dinners are often organized by religious or community groups , since they simplify the meal planning and distribute the costs among the participants . Smaller , more informal get-togethers with distributed food preparation may also be called potlucks . The only traditional rule is that each dish be large enough to be shared among a good portion ( but not necessarily all ) of the anticipated guests . In some cases each participant agrees ahead of time to bring a single course , and the result is a multi-course meal . Guests may bring in any form of food , ranging from the main course to desserts . In the United States , potlucks are associated with crockpot dishes , casseroles and jello salads . One variation is the progressive dinner or safari supper , where a group of neighbors physically move between different houses for each part of the meal . Typically , this involves the preparation of one course only ( a starter , main course or dessert , etc. ) , and visiting different neighbors for the other courses . Although it does require careful and complex planning , the idea is relatively straightforward : for example , Neighbor A makes a starter , and is visited by Neighbors B and C. After this , Neighbor A moves to a different house , Neighbor D , and is joined by Neighbor E. Neighbors B and C go on to different houses also , but not the same one . Finally , a similar pattern for dessert : Neighbor A moves to Neighbor F 's house , joined by Neighbor G. This style of eating has recently become popular as a charity fund raiser in rural Britain , and is seen as a good way of meeting different neighbors in the community by virtue of each participant having 6 separate guests . Another variation on the potluck dinner is the rota meal . Participants take turns providing food for the entire group , rather than each participant bringing a dish . For regular meals with a fairly consistent set of participants , this dramatically reduces the amount of preparation effort required .

Sodium chromate ( Na2CrO4 ) is a yellow solid chemical compound used as a corrosion inhibitor in the petroleum industry , a dyeing auxiliary in the textile industry , as a wood preservative . and as a diagnostic pharmaceutical in determining red blood cell volume . It is obtained from the reaction of sodium dichromate with sodium hydroxide . It is hygroscopic and can form tetra - , hexa - , and decahydrates . Sodium chromate , like other hexavalent chromium compounds , can be carcinogenic . The substance is a strong oxidant . It is soluble in water , producing a weakly basic solution .
County Sligo is one of the administrative counties of the Republic of Ireland and one of the thirty-two traditional counties of the island of Ireland , located in the province of Connacht . It was named after the town of Sligo which is the anglisation of Sligeach meaning Place of the Shells . The population of the county is 60,894 according to the 2006 census . Sligo is the 22nd largest of Ireland 's 32 counties in area and 26th largest in terms of population . It is the fourth largest of Connacht 's 5 counties in size and third largest in terms of population . Sligo County Council is the governing body for the county . It is divided into five Local Electoral Areas ( LEAs ) Ballymote , Dromore , Sligo-Drumcliffe , Sligo-Strandhill and Tubbercurry . There are 25 members elected to Sligo County Council . Sligo is part of the Sligo-North Leitrim constituency and has three representatives ( TD 's ) in DÃ il Ã ireann , Tony McLoughlin ( FG ) , John Perry ( FG ) and Michael Colreavy ( SF ) . It also has two representatives to Seanad Ã ireann Marc MacSharry and Gearldine Feeney . The megalithic cemetery of Carrowmore is located in County Sligo . It forms part of a huge complex of Stone Age remains connecting Carrowkeel in South Sligo to the Ox Mountains , to the Cuil Irra Peninsula , where Queen Maeve 's tomb dominates the skyline from the crest of Knocknarea Mountain . The poet and Nobel laureate William Butler Yeats ( 1865 â `` 1939 ) spent much of his childhood in northern Sligo and the county 's landscapes ( particularly the Isle of Innisfree , in Lough Gill ) were the inspiration for much of his poetry . Yeats said , `` the place that has really influenced my life most is Sligo . '' He is buried in North County Sligo , `` Under Ben Bulben '' , in Drumcliffe . County Sligo has a long history of traditional music . The south of the county is particularly noted with such musical luminaries as James Morrison , Michael Coleman , Paddy Killoran , Fred Finn , Peter Horan , Joe O'Dowd , Jim Donoghue , Martin Wynne , OisÃ n Mac Diarmada ( of TÃ ada ) , tin-whistle player Carmel Gunning and the band Dervish . The county has many traditional music festivals and one of the most well known is the Queen Maeve International Summer School , a traditional Irish Music summer school of music and dance which is held annually in August in Sligo Town . On the more contemporary music scene there are Westlife , Tabby Callaghan and The Conway Sisters who are from Sligo . Strandhill , about 9 km west of Sligo , hosts the Strandhill Guitar Festival each year , featuring a wide variety of guitar music and musicians .
There are two living verified veterans of World War I ( 28 July 1914 â `` 11 November 1918 ) . Both are from the Allies . The last Central Powers veteran , Franz KÃ 1\/4 nstler of Austria-Hungary , died on 27 May 2008 at the age of 107 . The total number of participating personnel is estimated by the Encyclopaedia Britannica at 65,038,810 . There were approximately 9,750,103 military deaths during the conflict . Veterans , for this purpose , are defined as people who were members of the armed forces of one of the combatant nations up to and including the date of the Armistice . Other World War I-era veterans are listed separately . This policy may vary from the policy in actual use in some countries . Listed here are those whose service is considered outside the scope of World War I. Reasons for this could be that they joined the armed services after the Armistice date , but before the Treaty of Versailles ; or where there is debate on their join-date ; or whose military service is sometimes viewed as outside the scope of World War I , but are considered World War I-era veterans by the press or by their respective governments ; or who served in a related conflict .
Protoplasm is the living content of a cell that is surrounded by a plasma membrane ( cell membrane ) . Protoplasm is composed of a mixture of small molecules such as ions , amino acids , monosaccharides and water , and macromolecules such as nucleic acids , proteins , lipids and polysaccharides . In eukaryotes the protoplasm surrounding the cell nucleus is known as the cytoplasm and that inside the nucleus as the nucleoplasm . In prokaryotes the material inside the plasma membrane is the bacterial cytoplasm , while in gram-negative bacteria the region outside the plasma membrane but inside the outer membrane is the periplasm . Protoplasm is distinct from non-living cell components lumped under `` ergastic substances '' or inclusion bodies , although ergastic substances can occur in the protoplasm . In many plant cells most of the volume of the cell is not occupied by protoplasm , but by `` tonoplast '' , a large water filled vacuole enclosed by a membrane . A protoplast is a plant or fungal cell that has had its cell wall removed . The word protoplasm comes from the Greek protos for first , and plasma for thing formed . It was first used in 1846 by Hugo von Mohl to describe the `` tough , slimy , granular , semi-fluid '' substance within plant cells , to distinguish this from the cell wall , cell nucleus and the cell sap within the vacuole . Thomas Huxley later referred to it as the `` physical basis of life '' and considered that the property of life resulted from the distribution of molecules within this substance . Its composition , however , was mysterious and there was much controversy over what sort of substance it was . Unsurprisingly , attempts to investigate the origin of life through the creation of synthetic `` protoplasm '' in the laboratory were not successful . The idea that protoplasm is divisible into a ground substance called `` cytoplasm '' and a structural body called the cell nucleus reflects the more primitive knowledge of cell structure that preceded the development of electron microscopy , when it seemed that cytoplasm was a homogeneous fluid and the existence of most sub-cellular compartments , or how cells maintain their shape , was unknown . Today , it is known that the cell contents are structurally very complex and contain multiple organelles .
Tetracycline ( INN ) is a broad-spectrum polyketide antibiotic produced by the Streptomyces genus of Actinobacteria , indicated for use against many bacterial infections . It is a protein synthesis inhibitor . It is commonly used to treat acne today , and , more recently , rosacea , and played a historical role in reducing the incidence of mortality because of cholera . It is marketed under the brand names Sumycin , Terramycin , Tetracyn , and Panmycin , among others . Actisite is a thread-like fiber form , used in dental applications . It is also used to produce several semisynthetic derivatives , which together are known as the tetracycline antibiotics . Tetracyclines bind to the 30S subunit of microbial ribosomes . They inhibit protein synthesis by blocking the attachment of charged aminoacyl-tRNA . Thus they prevent introduction of new amino acids to the nascent peptide chain . The action is usually inhibitory and reversible upon withdrawal of the drug . Resistance to the tetracyclines results from changes in permeability of the microbial cell envelope . In susceptible cells , the drug is concentrated from the environment and does not readily leave the cell . In resistant cells , the drug is not actively transported into the cell or leaves it so rapidly that inhibitory concentrations are not maintained . This is often plasmid-controlled . Mammalian cells are not vulnerable to the effect of tetracyclines as these contain no 30S ribosomal subunit and therefore do not actively concentrate the drug . Tetracycline is also being used in recent years as a scar tissue remover . The Tetracycline breaks down scar tissue and promotes healthy skin growth that causes a semi-rapid normal skin tissue growth that makes any scars unnoticeable . The tetracyclines are a large family of antibiotics that were discovered as natural products by Benjamin Minge Duggar and first described in 1948 . Under Yellapragada Subbarao , Benjamin Duggar made his discovery of the world 's first tetracycline antibiotic , Aureomycin , in 1945 . In 1950 , Harvard Professor Robert Woodward determined the chemical structure of Terramycin , the brand name for a member of the tetracycline family ; the patent protection for its fermentation and production was also first issued in 1950 . A research team of seven scientists ( Drs. K.J. Brunings , Francis A. Hochstein , C.R. Stephens , L.H. Conover , Abraham Bavley , Richard Pasternack , and Peter P. Regna ) at Pfizer , in collaboration with Woodward , participated in the two-year research leading to the discovery . Nubian mummies studied in the 1990s were found to contain significant levels of tetracycline ; there is evidence that the beer brewed at the time could have been the source . Tetracycline sparked the development of many chemically altered antibiotics , and in doing so has proved to be one of the most important discoveries made in the field of antibiotics . It is used to treat many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and some protozoa . It , like some other antibiotics , is also used in the treatment of acne . In 2010 , the FDA added tetracycline to its Adverse Event Reporting System ( AERS ) . The AERS contains a list of medications under investigation by the FDA for potential safety issues . The list is published quarterly and available online . The AERS cites a potential link between the use of tetracycline products and Stevens-Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme . It is first-line therapy for Rocky Mountain spotted fever ( Rickettsia ) , Q fever ( Coxiella ) , psittacosis and lymphogranuloma venereum ( Chlamydia ) , and to eradicate nasal carriage of meningococci . Tetracycline tablets were used in the plague outbreak in India in 1992 . Doxycycline is also one ( of many ) recommended drugs for chemoprophylatic treatment of malaria in travels to areas of the world where malaria is endemic . Since tetracycline is absorbed into bone , it is used as a marker of bone growth for biopsies in humans . Tetracycline labeling is used to determine the amount of bone growth within a certain period of time , usually a period of approximately 21 days . Tetracycline is incorporated into mineralizing bone and can be detected by its fluorescence . In double tetracycline labeling , a second dose is given 11 â `` 14 days after the first dose , and the amount of bone formed during that interval can be calculated by measuring the distance between the two fluorescent labels . Tetracycline is also used as a biomarker in wildlife to detect consumption of medicine - or vaccine-containing baits . In genetic engineering , tetracycline is used in transcriptional activation . Tetracycline is also one of the antibiotics used to treat ulcers caused by bacterial infections . In cancer research at Harvard Medical School , tetracycline has been used to reliably cause regression of advanced stages of leukemia in mice , by placing it in their drinking water . Tetracycline is used in cell biology as selective agent in cell culture systems . It is toxic to prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and selects for cells harboring the bacterial tetr gene , which encodes a 399-amino acid membrane-associated protein . This protein actively exports tetracycline out of the cell , rendering cells harboring this gene more resistant to the drug . The yellow crystalline powder can be dissolved in water ( 20 mg\/ml ) or ethanol ( 5 mg\/ml ) and is routinely used at 10 mg\/l in cell culture . In cell culture at 37 C , it is stable for four days .
In Greek mythology , Nyx ( , Nox in Roman translation ) was the primordial goddess of the night . A shadowy figure , Nyx stood at or near the beginning of creation , and was the mother of personified gods such as Hypnos ( sleep ) and ThÃ natos ( death ) . Her appearances in mythology are sparse , but reveal her as a figure of exceptional power and beauty . In Hesiod 's Theogony , Nyx is born of Chaos ; her offspring are many , and telling . With Erebus the deity of shadow and darkness , Nyx gives birth to Aether ( atmosphere ) and Hemera ( day ) . Later , on her own , Nyx gives birth to Momus ( blame ) , Moros ( doom ) , Thanatos ( death ) , Hypnos ( sleep ) , Charon ( the ferryman of Hades ) , the Oneiroi ( dreams ) , the Hesperides , the Keres and Moirae ( Fates ) , Nemesis ( retribution ) , Apate ( deception ) , Philotes ( friendship ) , Geras ( age ) , and Eris ( strife ) . In his description of Tartarus , Hesiod says further that Hemera ( day ) , who is Nyx 's daughter , left Tartarus just as Nyx entered it ; when Hemera returned , Nyx left . This mirrors the portrayal of Ratri ( night ) in the Rigveda , where she works in close cooperation but also tension with her sister Ushas ( dawn ) . In Book 14 of Homer 's Iliad , there is a quote by Hypnos , the minor god of sleep , in which he reminds Hera of an old favor after she asks him to put Zeus to sleep . He had once before put Zeus to sleep at the bidding of Hera , allowing her to cause Heracles ( who was returning by sea from Laomedon 's Troy ) great misfortune . Zeus was furious and would have smitten Hypnos into the sea if he had not fled to Nyx , his mother , in fear . Hypnos goes on to say that Zeus , fearing to anger Nyx , held his fury at bay , and in this way Hypnos escaped the wrath of Zeus . He disturbed Zeus only a few times after that always fearing Zeus and running back to his mother Nyx , who would have confronted Zeus with a maternal fury . Nyx took on an even more important role in several fragmentary poems attributed to Orpheus . In them , Nyx , rather than Chaos , is the first principle . Nyx occupies a cave or adyton , in which she gives oracles . Cronus â `` who is chained within , asleep and drunk on honey â `` dreams and prophesies . Outside the cave , Adrasteia clashes cymbals and beats upon her tympanon , moving the entire universe in an ecstatic dance to the rhythm of Nyx 's chanting . Phanes â `` the strange , monstrous , hermaphrodite Orphic demiurge â `` was the child or father of Nyx . Nyx is also the first principle in the opening chorus of Aristophanes ' The Birds , which may be Orphic in inspiration . Here she is also the mother of Eros . In other texts she may be the mother of Charon ( with Erebus ) , and Phthonus `` envy '' ( with Dionysus ? ) . The theme of Nyx 's cave or mansion , beyond the ocean ( as in Hesiod ) or somewhere at the edge of the cosmos ( as in later Orphism ) may be echoed in the philosophical poem of Parmenides . The classical scholar Walter Burkert has speculated that the house of the goddess to which the philosopher is transported is the palace of Nyx ; this hypothesis , however , must remain tentative . There is also rumor that Nyx gave birth to her reincarnation , a son whose name would also be Nyx . But she gave birth to twins , having a daughter as well , who was named Hemera , `` Day '' . The text implied that Hemera was not the sister of Aether , but the sister of Nyx 's reincarnation . In Greece , Nyx is only rarely the focus of cults . According to Pausanias , she had an oracle on the acropolis at Megara . More often , Nyx lurks in the background of other cults . Thus there was a statue called `` Nyx '' in the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus . The Spartans had a cult of Sleep and Death , conceived of as twins . Cult titles composed of compounds of nyx - are attested for several gods , most notably Dionysus Nyktelios `` nocturnal '' and Aphrodite Philopannyx `` who loves the whole night '' . In 1997 , the International Astronomical Union approved the name Nyx for a mons ( mountain\/peak ) feature on the planet Venus . Nyx Mons is located at 30 Â north latitude and 48.5 Â longitude on the Venusian surface . Its diameter is 875 km . A map of Nyx Mons on Venus can be viewed at Map of Nyx Mons â `` V9 Quad â `` Bell Regio ( 1.1 MB ) . On June 21 , 2006 , the International Astronomical Union renamed one of Pluto 's recently discovered moons ( S\/2005 P 2 ) to Nix , in honor of Nyx . The name was spelled with an `` i '' instead of a `` y '' , to avoid conflict with the asteroid 3908 Nyx .
Alexander `` Killer '' Kaleta ( November 29 , 1919 -- July 9 , 1987 ) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player . He played in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) for the Chicago Black Hawks and New York Rangers and is best known for his part in originating hockey 's hat trick tradition . After playing in the Alberta Senior Hockey League ( ASHL ) , Kaleta joined the NHL with the Chicago Black Hawks in 1941 â `` 42 . He recorded 28 points in 47 games as a rookie that season . During his tenure with the Black Hawks , he is credited with having begun the tradition of the hat trick during the 1945 â `` 46 season , when he entered a shop in Toronto looking for a new hat . Without enough money to buy one , he reached an agreement with shop owner Sammy Taft that if he scored three goals that night in a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs , he would earn a free hat . In fact , that night , on January 26 , 1946 , he scored four goals against the Leafs . While there are other accounts of the hat trick 's origin in hockey , Kaleta 's story is the one recognized by the Hockey Hall of Fame . Kaleta went on to complete the season that year with an NHL career-high 46 points . After four seasons with the Black Hawks , Kaleta joined the New York Rangers in 1948 â `` 49 . He recorded consecutive 31-point seasons in two seasons with the Rangers before ending his NHL career by joining the Saskatoon Quakers of the minor pro Pacific Coast Hockey League ( PCHL ) in 1951 â `` 52 . The next season , the PCHL was absorbed by the Western Hockey League ( WHL ) , where Kaleta played with the Quakers for three more seasons before retiring in 1954 â `` 55 .

Long ton ( weight ton or imperial ton ) is the name for the unit called the `` ton '' in the avoirdupois or Imperial system of measurements , as used in the United Kingdom and several other Commonwealth countries . It has been mostly replaced by the tonne , and in the United States by the short ton . One long ton is equal to 2240 l , 1.12 times as a short ton , or 35 c of salt water with a density of 64 lb\/ft Â ( 1.025 g\/ml ) . It has some limited use in the United States , most commonly in measuring the displacement of ships , and was the unit prescribed for warships by the Washington Naval Treaty -- for example battleships were limited to a mass of 35,000 L.

Mount Olivet is a city in and the county seat of Robertson County , Kentucky , United States . The population was 289 at the 2000 census . The population has declined from 442 in 1970 , 346 in 1980 , and 384 in 1990 . Mount Olivet was founded around 1820 incorporated on December 27 , 1851 and was named after the Mount of Olives , a biblical reference . It is centered around the junction of US 62 and Kentucky Route 165 . The primary explorer and early protector of this region was Simon Kenton , a contemporary of Daniel Boone . In 1782 Boone and other early pioneers took part in the Battle of Blue Licks along the Licking River . The pioneers were greatly outnumbered and lost the battle as they went up against a superior force of British-Canadian soldiers and Native Americans . The battle occurred almost ten months after the surrender of British Commander Cornwallis . Among the 70 pioneers who died was Booneâ s youngest son , Israel . It was the last major battle of the Revolutionary War . Mount Olivet is located at ( 38.531827 , -84.037167 ) . According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 0.4 square miles ( 1.0 kmÂ ) , all of it land . As of the census of 2000 , there were 289 people , 130 households , and 73 families residing in the city . The population density was 751.8 people per square mile ( 293.6 \/ kmÂ ) . There were 145 housing units at an average density of 377.2 \/ sq mi ( 147.3 \/ kmÂ ) . The racial makeup of the city was 97.92 % White , 1.38 % from other races , and 0.69 % from two or more races . Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.38 % of the population . There were 130 households out of which 28.5 % had children under the age of 18 living with them , 33.1 % were married couples living together , 16.2 % had a female householder with no husband present , and 43.8 % were non-families . 38.5 % of all households were made up of individuals and 21.5 % had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older . The average household size was 2.22 and the average family size was 2.88 . In the city the population was spread out with 26.0 % under the age of 18 , 8.3 % from 18 to 24 , 19.7 % from 25 to 44 , 25.3 % from 45 to 64 , and 20.8 % who were 65 years of age or older . The median age was 40 years . For every 100 females there were 74.1 males . For every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 75.4 males . The median income for a household in the city was $ 18,750 , and the median income for a family was $ 25,625 . Males had a median income of $ 21,667 versus $ 21,250 for females . The per capita income for the city was $ 12,172 . About 38.4 % of families and 37.5 % of the population were below the poverty line , including 56.1 % of those under the age of eighteen and 23.2 % of those sixty five or over .
The 1963 Formula One season was the 14th season of FIA Formula One motor racing . It featured the 14th FIA World Championship of Drivers , the sixth International Cup for F1 Manufacturers and numerous non-championship Formula One races . The World Championship commenced on May 26 , 1963 , and ended on December 28 after ten races . Jim Clark won his first championship with seven wins to two by Graham Hill and one by John Surtees in a revised Ferrari . The ATS venture , founded by ex-Ferrari workers , a complete disaster which ruined Phil Hill 's grand prix career , was unrelated to the late 1970s German operation which was marginally more successful . The following teams and drivers competed in the 1963 FIA World Championship . Points were awarded on an 9-6-4-3-2-1 basis at each round , with only the best six round results retained . â No points awarded as Hill 's car was pushed at the start line . Points were awarded on a 9-6-4-3-2-1 basis at each round with only the best six round results retained . Only the best placed car from each manufacturer at each round was eligible to score points . Other Formula One races were also held in 1963 , which did not count towards the World Championship .
Sapindaceae , also known as the soapberry family , is a family of flowering plants in the order Sapindales . There are about 140-150 genera with 1400-2000 species , including maple , horse chestnut and lychee . Sapindaceae members occur in temperate to tropical regions throughout the world . Many are lactiferous , i.e. they contain milky sap , and many contain mildly toxic saponins with soap-like qualities in either the foliage and\/or the seeds , or roots . The largest genera are Serjania , Paullinia , Acer and Allophylus . The largely temperate genera formerly separated in the families Aceraceae ( Acer , Dipteronia ) and Hippocastanaceae ( Aesculus , Billia , Handeliodendron ) were included within a more broadly circumscribed Sapindaceae by the APG . Recent research has confirmed the inclusion of these genera in Sapindaceae . Plants of this family have a variety of habits , from trees to herbaceous plants or lianas . Their leaves usually spirally alternate , sometimes ( in Acer , Aesculus , and a few other genera ) opposite . They are most often pinnately compound , sometimes palmately , or just palmate ( Acer , Aesculus ) , with a petiole lacking stipules , but having a swollen base . Flowers are small and unisexual , or functionally unisexual , though plants may be either dioecious or monoecious . They are usually grouped in cymes grouped in panicles . They most often have four or five petals and sepals ( petals are absent in Dodonaea ) . The stamens range from four to ten , usually on a nectar disc between the petals and stamen , their filaments are often hairy . The most frequent number is eight , in two rings of four . The gynoecium contains two or three carpels , sometimes up to six . There is usually only one style with a lobed stigma . Most often pollinated by birds or insects , with a few species pollinated by wind . The fruits are fleshy or dry . They may be nuts , berries , drupes , schizocarps , capsules ( Bridgesia ) , or samaras ( Acer ) . The embryos are bent or coiled , without endosperm in the seed , but frequently with an aril . Sapindaceae are related to Rutaceae , and both are usually placed in an order Sapindales or Rutales , depending on whether they are kept separate and which name is used for the order . The most basal member appears to be Xanthoceras . Some authors maintain some or all of Hippocastanaceae and Aceraceae , although this may result in paraphyly . The former Ptaeroxylaceae , now placed in Rutaceae , were sometimes placed in Sapindaceae . The family is divided in 5 or 6 subfamily depending on treatment . Sapindaceae includes many species of economically valuable tropical fruit , including the lychee , longan , pitomba , guinip , korlan , rambutan , mamoncillo and ackee . Other products include Guarana , soapberries and maple syrup . Some species of Maple and Buckeye are valued for their wood , while several other genera , such as Koelreuteria , Cardiospermum and Ungnadia , are popular ornamentals . Schleichera trijuga is the source of Indian macassar oil . Saponins extracted from the drupe of Sapindus species are effective surfactants and are used commercially in cosmetics and detergents .

Tynan 's biography was published in March 2009 , entitled `` The Original Football Idol : The Tommy Tynan story '' . Robin Michael Lawrence , commonly known as Lennie Lawrence , ( born 12 December 1947 in Brighton , England ) is a British football manager who is assistant manager of Crystal Palace . He has managed a number of English clubs and one Welsh club in a coaching career spanning over 30 years . His most recent post was as Director of Football at Bristol Rovers , which he held from 2006 until May 2010 . He is one of a select few managers to have managed over 1,000 games . Lawrence never played league football . He turned out at non-league level for , Carshalton Athletic and . He got his first managerial appointment at Plymouth Argyle as caretaker . He later worked as a coach at , helping them win promotion from Division Four in the 1980 -- 81 season . Lawrence moved to as reserve-team manager , and was later promoted to full-time manager in 1982 . During his first few years in charge , the club was in a poor financial situation and came close to going out of business in 1984 , and even left its home ground , The Valley , in 1985 . Despite this , Lawrence not only kept Charlton in the Second Division but gained promotion to the First Division in 1986 , ending Charlton 's 29-year absence from the top-flight . With limited resources , he kept Charlton at this level for four years , before being relegated in 1990 . He remained in charge for a further season . Before the start of the 1991 -- 92 season , Lawrence moved on to manage . Under his stewardship , Middlesbrough finished Second Division runners-up in his first season as manager and gained promotion to the new Premier League but they struggled in 1992 -- 93 and were relegated at the end of the season . Lawrence remained in charge until the end of the following season . Upon leaving he helped young chairman Steve Gibson contact his replacement Bryan Robson . Lawrence joined Bradford City at the beginning of the 1994 -- 95 season . After a mid-table finish in his first season , Bradford were challenging for promotion in his second season in charge before he left to manage struggling in the division above . Lawrence was unable to save Luton from relegation to Division Two at the end of the 1995 -- 96 season , which saw them replaced by former club Bradford . He remained in charge at Kenilworth Road until 2000 when he was sacked by the new incoming Luton chairman , Mike Watson Challis , and replaced with former Luton fans favorite , Ricky Hill . His time at Luton is not fondly remembered by Luton fans , who did n't agree with Lawrence 's assertion that the club should be happy to be playing Division Two ( now League One ) football . He made a quick return to management shortly after the beginning of the 2000 -- 01 season with Division One side Grimsby Town . They avoided relegation and made a reasonable start to the 2001 -- 02 season , and caused an upset in the League Cup third round by knocking out holders Liverpool 2 -- 1 after extra time at Anfield , scoring with a Phil Jevons wonder-goal in the last minute . However he was sacked later in the season after Grimsby dropped to the bottom of the table . During the opening weeks of the 2001-02 season , his Grimsby side had briefly led Division One , sparking hopes that he could repeat the promotion success he achieved at Charlton Athletic and Middlesbrough with a much smaller club . However , these hopes were quickly extinguished as Grimsby 's form plunged . After a short while out of the game he joined Division Two side as a consultant . Owner Sam Hammam had made it clear to manager Alan Cork that he expected back-to-back promotions , which it did not look like Cork was going to deliver . Eventually Cork was sacked , and Lawrence took over the manager 's chair . In his first full season in charge , Lawrence took Cardiff to promotion after beating in the 2003 Football League Second Division play-off final . He remained at Ninian Park for a further two years before being shunted aside in May 2005 . After acting as a consultant at Cardiff for a while , he was appointed Director of Football at Bristol Rovers , working alongside coach Paul Trollope in a two-tier managerial structure . In the pair 's first full season in charge , Bristol Rovers won promotion into League One after winning the League Two play-offs . He remained in this position until leaving the club on 12 May 2010 , with their League One status still intact . In August 2010 , Lawrence joined non-league Carshalton Athletic in a football consultancy role , assisting manager Mark Butler . Four months later , he was appointed technical director at Hereford United in League Two , to assist new manager Jamie Pitman .
Paderborn is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia , Germany , capital of the Paderborn district . The name of the city derives from the river Pader , which originates in more than 200 springs near Paderborn Cathedral , where St. Liborius is buried . Paderborn was founded as a bishopric by Charlemagne in 795 . In 799 Pope Leo III fled his enemies in Rome and reached Paderborn , where he met Charlemagne . Charlemagne reinstated Leo in Rome in 800 and was crowned as Holy Roman Emperor by Leo in return . The bishop of Paderborn became a Prince of the Empire in 1100 . The city was taken by Prussia in 1802 , then by the French vassal state Kingdom of Westphalia from 1807 to 1813 and then returned to Prussia . The tree Irminsul was supposedly located near Paderborn . Paderborn was the seat of the Bishopric of Paderborn ; today it is seat of a Roman Catholic archbishop .

The 1960 â `` 61 NHL season was the 44th season of the National Hockey League . Six teams each played 70 games . For the first time since 1950 , two American based teams competed for the Stanley Cup and it was the Chicago Black Hawks beating the Detroit Red Wings four games to two . It was Chicago 's first Cup win since 1938 , not winning another until the 2009-2010 season . Gordie Howe became the first player in NHL history to achieve the career mark of 1000 regular season points . It would be 7 more seasons before Jean Beliveau matched the feat . The original Hart Trophy was retired , as all its plaques were filled and its general condition had deteriorated . It was decided to donate the Hart Memorial Trophy in its place . On September 15 , 1960 , Rocket Richard announced his retirement from hockey . During his career , he had lead all scorers with a record 544 goals plus 82 for the playoffs . Despite the league expanding the number of games in a season to 70 games from 50 since Richard 's famous 50 goals in 50 games , Richard remained the only player to score 50 goals in a season , until this season . Chicago now had a powerful team , especially its defense , which had Pierre Pilote , Al Arbour , Jack Evans and Elmer Vasko . It was reported that the old-time great defense player Eddie Shore had been stricken with a heart attack , but was resting comfortably in a Springfield hospital . In a game on October 13 , the Canadiens routed the Rangers 8 â `` 4 , with Bernie Geoffrion and Dickie Moore each having hat tricks .

On December 1 , the Canadiens , who had traded Andre Pronovost to Boston for Guy Gendron , defeated the Maple Leafs 6 â `` 3 at the Forum . Gendron had a goal , but the main feature was the 21 penalties referee Frank Udvari had to call , including several majors in the third period . Henri Richard took on Frank Mahovlich , Dickie Moore took on Bob Pulford and Marcel Bonin took on Bobby Baun . Toronto general manager-coach Punch Imlach was in a bad mood following the game and said to the press among other things that referee Udvari and linesman Loring Doolittle and George Hayes should have been picked as the three stars for the help they gave to Montreal . This was brought to the attention of NHL president Clarence Campbell who fined Imlach $ 200 . Stan Mikita was helping to spark Chicago . He scored two goals in a 3 â `` 2 win over the Rangers on January 4 and scored the winner the next night when the Black Hawks beat Boston 4 â `` 3 the following night . Leo Lamoureux , former defenceman for the Montreal Canadiens , died in Indianapolis on January 11 at age 45 . Chicago defeated the Rangers 4 â `` 3 on March 8 . Gump Worsley pulled a hamstring muscle and Joe Shaefer replaced him with the score 1 â `` 1 . The next night , the Rangers were eliminated from the playoffs as Bernie Geoffrion hat the hat trick in a 6 â `` 1 pasting by the Canadiens . Johnny Bower , who appeared on his way to winning the Vezina Trophy , strained a leg muscle and would have to take a rest . Cesare Maniago played in goal for Toronto on March 16 and lost 5 â `` 2 . It looked like two players , Frank Mahovlich of Toronto and Bernie `` Boom Boom '' Geoffrion of Montreal , were going to hit 50 but Mahovlich ended up slumping near the end of the season and missed 50 by two goals . Geoffrion scored his 50th goal that night and got a wild ovation . He also added 45 assists and led the league in scoring . Toronto played a 2 â `` 2 tie with the New York Rangers in their final game of the season and Bobby Baun was a victim of his own hard hitting . Camille Henry of the Rangers ran into Baun and Henry 's skate cut Baun in the neck . Baun returned for the third period , but after the game while boarding the team bus , he began to gasp desperately . He groped for attention and waved his arms , and his teammates finally realized he was in trouble and rushed him to the hospital where an emergency operation was performed to permit breathing . Baun missed some action in the playoffs as the result of the injury . see 1961 Stanley Cup Finals .

Thornton ( together with its neighbouring village of Cleveleys , known as Thornton-Cleveleys ) is a village on the Fylde , in Lancashire , England , about four miles north of Blackpool and two miles south of Fleetwood . It is in the Borough of Wyre . The two villages are linked by Victoria Road . Thornton is mentioned in the Domesday Book where it was referred to as Torentum but its much younger neighbor , Cleveleys , a bustling seaside resort , developed in the 19th century around a hotel owned by a Mr. Cleveleys . Thornton for Cleveleys railway station was formerly the principal intermediate stop on the Fleetwood branch of the LMS\/British Rail London Midland Region railway , running from Poulton-le-Fylde , but it has been years since the station was used , and with the recent fencing-over of the level crossing in Station Road\/Victoria Road East in order to prevent youths from congregating on the tracks , the glory days of Thornton are long since gone . However , a decision by an action group based in Poulton means they will finance a feasibility study into bringing the railway back to Thornton and Fleetwood . Marsh Mill , a large well-preserved windmill , built in 1794 , is a prominent landmark . It was commissioned by Bold Hesketh , uncle of Peter Hesketh ( later Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood ) who would go on to play a prominent role in the expansion of Fleetwood . Tragedy struck in May 1930 , when a Miss Alice Baldwin and a Mrs Mary Jane Bailey visited the windmill with an interest in purchasing it . However , when both women stepped onto the fantail platform , the platform collapsed and the women fell to their deaths . Thornton contains a number of schools , including Thornton Primary School , Stanah County Primary School , Royles Brook Primary School , and Millfield Science and Performing Arts College in addition to a small public library .

Progressive bluegrass is one of two major subgenres of bluegrass music . It is also known as newgrass , a term attributed to New Grass Revival member Ebo Walker . Musicians and bands John Hartford , New Grass Revival , J.D. Crowe and the New South , The Dillards , Boone Creek , Country Gazette , and the Seldom Scene pioneered innovations in the genre . Some groups began using electric instruments and importing songs from other genres , particularly rock & roll . Progressive bluegrass became popular in the late 1960s and 1970s , but it can be traced back to the banjo and contrabass duets that Earl Scruggs played even in the earliest days of the Foggy Mountain Boys . The four key distinguishing elements of progressive bluegrass are ( 1 ) instrumentation , frequently including electric guitars , drums , piano , and more , ( 2 ) songs imported or styles imitated from other musical genres like jazz , rock and others , ( 3 ) non-traditional chord progressions , ( 4 ) lengthy `` jam band '' - style improvisation . However , not all these elements are always present in progressive bluegrass . Progressive bluegrass continues to be performed by bands today . Innovative groups include Nickel Creek , Yonder Mountain String Band , Trampled By Turtles , Crooked Still , The String Cheese Incident , Punch Brothers , and Railroad Earth . Many older newgrass musicians , along with music festivals such as NedFest , DelFest , and Telluride Bluegrass Festival , have been instrumental in cultivating the continued popularity of progressive bluegrass .
The Tungusic languages ( also known as Manchu-Tungus , Tungus ) are spoken by Tungusic peoples in Eastern Siberia and Manchuria . Many Tungusic languages are endangered , and the long-term future of the family is uncertain . Traditionally , linguists considered Tungusic to be part of the Altaic language family along with the Turkic and Mongolic language families ; more recent proposals are a Macro-Altaic also including Japanese and Korean , or on the other hand , that Altaic is not a genetic group but a Sprachbund . Linguists working on Tungusic have proposed a number of different classifications based on different criteria , including morphological , lexical , and phonological characteristics . One classification which seems favored over other alternatives is that the Tungusic languages can be divided into a northern branch and a southern branch , with the southern branch further subdivided into southeastern and southwestern groups . Jurchen-Manchu ( Jurchen and Manchu are simply different stages of the same language ; in fact , the ethnonym `` Manchu '' did not come about until 1636 when Emperor Hong Taiji decreed that the term would replace `` Jurchen '' ) is the only Tungusic language with a literary form ( in Jurchen script and later the Manchu alphabet ) which dates back to at least the mid - to late-12th century ; as such it is a very important language for the reconstruction of Proto-Tungusic . The earliest and one of the most important extant texts in Jurchen is the inscription on the back of `` the Jin Victory Memorial Stele '' ( Da Jin deshengtuo songbei ) , which was erected in 1185 , during the Dading period ( 1161 â `` 1189 ) . It is apparently an abbreviated translation of the Chinese text on the front of the stele . The Tungusic languages are of an agglutinative morphological type , and some of them have complex case systems and elaborate patterns of tense and aspect marking . They also exhibit a complex pattern of vowel harmony , based on the parameters of vowel roundedness and vowel tenseness . Another common feature is vocabulary , such as Manchu emu , zhuwe , ilan , meaning 1,2,3 . Tungusic has traditionally been linked with Turkic and Mongolic languages in the Altaic language family . Others have suggested that the Tungusic languages might be related ( perhaps as a paraphyletic outgroup ) to the Korean , Japonic , or Ainu languages as well .

In Greek mythology , Pontus ( or Pontos ( Î Ï Î 1\/2 Ï Î Ï ) , English translation : `` sea '' ) was an ancient , pre-Olympian sea-god , one of the protogenoi , the `` first-born '' . Pontus was the son of Gaia , the Earth : Hesiod says that Gaia brought forth Pontus out of herself , without coupling . For Hesiod , Pontus seems little more than a personification of the sea , ho pontos , `` the Road '' , by which Hellenes signified the Mediterranean Sea . With Gaia , he was the father of Nereus ( the Old Man of the Sea ) , of Thaumas ( the awe-striking `` wonder '' of the Sea , embodiment of the sea 's dangerous aspects ) , of Phorcys and his sister-consort Ceto , and of the `` Strong Goddess '' Eurybia . With the sea goddess Thalassa ( whose own name simply means `` sea '' but is derived from a pre-Greek root ) , he fathered the Telchines . Compare the sea-Titan Oceanus , the Ocean-Stream that girdled the earth , who was more vividly realized than Pontus among the Hellenes . Nevertheless , Pontus was apparently personified in a description of a painting by the 3rd century AD rhetorician Philostratus the Elder , Imagines . In a Roman sculpture of the 2nd century AD ( illustration on the right ) Pontus , rising from seaweed , grasps a rudder with his right hand and leans on the prow of a ship . He wears a mural crown , and accompanies Fortuna , whose draperies appear at the left , as twin patron deities of the Black Sea port of Tomis in Moesia .
The U.S. Highway 66 Association was organized in Tulsa , Oklahoma in 1927 . Its purpose was to get U.S. Highway 66 paved from end to end and to promote tourism on the highway . The organization was similar to many that existed before the creation of federal highways in 1926 , such as those that promoted the Lincoln Highway , the National Old Trails Highway , and others . John T. Woodruff of Springfield , Missouri was elected the first president . The association began to advertise the highway in magazines , on billboards , and brochures . The continued push to completely pave the highway and complete an unfinished section ( Watson Road in St. Louis , Missouri ) paid off , the road was fully paved and completed in 1938 , including a cut-off across New Mexico , bypassing a loop through Santa Fe . In 1955 , construction began on the new Interstate Highway System . As these new interstates began to replace longer and longer sections of the old highway , the group in 1970 changed its name to the Main Street of America Association and continued to stand as a voice for the older highway . The association published its last brochure in 1974 ; the brochure 's cover referenced the new interstate highways that would lead to its demise . In 1976 , the association disbanded as U.S. Route 66 was now largely concurrent with I-55 , I-44 , I-40 , I-15 , and I-10 . In 1984 , the last section through Williams , Arizona was bypassed and in 1985 Route 66 was formally decommissioned . The former association is not officially connected with the various Route 66 associations which currently exist to preserve the historic highway .
Taupe ( , rhymes with `` rope '' ) is a dark grayish-brown color . The word `` taupe '' derives from the Latin name for the European Mole , Talpa europaea . Originally , this referred only to the average color of the French mole , but like the colors pink and lavender , the name expanded ( in the case of taupe beginning in the 1940s ) to encompass a wide range of varying shades . It seems that this occurred because the color of the fur of the mole can itself exhibit a wide range of shades , from gray through yellowish , brownish , and even purplish . Taupe is a vague , unscientific color term which may be used to refer to almost any grayish-brown , brownish-gray , or warm gray color . It often overlaps with tan and even people who use color professionally ( such as designers and artists ) frequently disagree as to what `` taupe '' means . There is no single , generally recognized authority for such terms . The color displayed at right matches the color sample called taupe referenced below in the 1930 book A Dictionary of Color , the world standard for color terms before the invention of computers . However , the word taupe may often be used to refer to lighter shades of taupe today , and therefore another name for this color is dark taupe . The first use of `` taupe '' as a color name in English was in the early 19th century ( exact year is not known ) . This is the most popular color for leather sofas . The color displayed at right is purple taupe . The color displayed at right is medium taupe . At right is displayed the color mauve taupe . The first recorded use of mauve taupe as a color name in English was in 1925 . A popular brand of professional plastic chessboards marketed to chess masters in the 1960s had squares of this color and the color magnolia because it was felt that those two colors were both easy on the eyes and aesthetic together . These boards were used by chess master George Koltanowski in his chess tournaments in which he played blindfolded against hundreds of people at a time . The color displayed at right is rose taupe . The first recorded use of rose taupe as a color name in English was in 1924 . At right is displayed the color sandy taupe . This color is also called taupe sand . Light taupe is the color that is called taupe in Crayola colored pencils . Pale taupe is a dusky brownish gray color . A British paint color name mouse 's back is similar in color and source of name . This color is also called mouse . The first recorded use of mouse as a color name in English was in 1606 . Displayed at right is the color taupe gray .
There have been nine goaltenders who have scored a goal in a National Hockey League ( NHL ) game . The first goaltender to score a goal by intentionally shooting the puck into the opponent 's net was the Philadelphia Flyers ' Ron Hextall , who , on December 8 , 1987 , scored in an empty net after Boston pulled their goaltender , Rejean Lemelin , for a sixth attacker late in the third period . Goaltenders can also be given credit for a goal when they are the last person to touch the puck before an opponent inadvertently puts the puck into their own net . This was the case for the most recent instance of goaltender scoring , when Chris Mason was credited with a goal in 2006 . The most recent goaltender to have scored a goal by deliberately shooting the puck into his opponents ' net was Evgeni Nabokov , in 2002 . Scoring a goal into the opposing team 's net is challenging for goaltenders . A realistic chance to score exists only when the six-foot-wide net on the other side of the rink is empty , due to the goaltender being pulled for an extra attacker : it is assumed that the opposing goaltender , if in net , does not commit a blunder . All NHL goaltenders who have scored a goal by shooting the puck have done so with an empty net ; the ones that have been credited with a goal was as a result of a blunder by the opposing team who had been playing with the extra attacker . When shooting the puck , goaltenders have to shoot from the other end of the rink , since it has been illegal for a goaltender to play the puck on the opponent 's side of the red line for over 30 years . Since the shot must be taken from his end , the goaltender must shoot the puck with a trajectory and speed that prevents the opposing team from stopping it while it travels . Billy Smith , in the 1979 â `` 80 season , was the first goaltender to be credited with a goal ; he was the last player to touch the puck before Rob Ramage of the Colorado Rockies put the puck into his own empty net . However , the participation of goaltenders in offense began long before that goal . In the early days of ice hockey , Hall of Fame goaltender Paddy Moran was beaten once by the opposing team 's goaltender , though not in the NHL . The Montreal Star reported that poor officiating resulted in only the goaltenders left on the ice ; Fred Brophy , the opposing goaltender , and Moran both exchanged scoring attempts , before Brophy beat Moran , while the latter and most of the spectators `` convulsed in laughter '' . The first goaltender credited with an assist in the NHL was Georges Vezina in the 1917 â `` 18 season , after a puck rebounded off his leg pad to a teammate who skated the length of the ice to score . In the 1935 â `` 36 season , Tiny Thompson became the first goaltender to gain an assist after making an intentional pass . During the Second World War , while playing for the All-Star Royal Canadian Army team , NHL goaltender Chuck Rayner carried the puck down the ice and beat the opposing goaltender ; in the NHL , he made numerous unsuccessful attempts to duplicate this feat . In the 1976 â `` 77 season , Los Angeles Kings goaltenders Rogatien Vachon briefly became the first goaltender to be credited with a goal when the opposing New York Islanders scored on themselves during a delayed penalty ; however , after video review , the goal was given to Vic Venasky as it was determined that he was the last Kings player to touch the puck before it went in the net . Of the eleven goals scored by NHL goaltenders , six were shot into the opposing team 's net by the goaltender . There have been two goaltenders that have scored and earned a shutout in the same game . Damian Rhodes , playing for the Ottawa Senators , was credited with a goal in a 6 â `` 0 win over the New Jersey Devils on January 2 , 1999 , and Jose Theodore , playing for the Montreal Canadiens , shot the puck into the New York Islanders ' empty net in a 3 â `` 0 victory on January 2 , 2001 . In addition to being the first goaltender to be credited with a goal , Billy Smith was the only goaltender to have lost the game in which he was credited with or had scored a goal . Though both Ron Hextall and Martin Brodeur have scored twice , Hextall is the only goaltender to score twice by directly shooting the puck into the opponent 's net . Martin Brodeur 's second goal was an own goal by the other team , where Brodeur received credit for touching the puck last . Interestingly , it is the only game-winning goal scored by a goaltender . Hextall and Brodeur both scored in a playoff game as well as a regular season game . Ron Hextall 's second goal is the only goal scored by a goaltender while his team was short handed , and Evgeni Nabokov 's goal is the only one that was scored on a power play .
Budding is a form of asexual reproduction in which a new organism grows on another one . The new organism remains attached as it grows , separating from the parent organism only when it is mature . Since the reproduction is asexual , the newly created organism is a clone and is genetically identical to the parent organism . In virology , budding is a form of viral shedding by which enveloped viruses acquire their external envelope from the host cell membrane , which bulges outwards and encloses the virion . In embryology , the term budding is applied to the process of embryo differentiation , in which new structures are formed in outgrowth from pre-existing parts . In agriculture and horticulture , budding refers to grafting the bud of one plant onto another .

Troll 3 ( also known as Creepers , Contamination .7 , Troll III : Contamination Point 7 , or The Crawlers ) is a 1993 Italian horror film directed by Joe D'Amato and Fabrizio Laurenti . Troll 3 has no plot connection to the original Troll or Troll 2 ( and these films ' plots have no connection to each other ) . Like Troll 2 , it features no trolls . Troll 2 is about goblins , while Troll 3 is about killer plants . It is also horror , not fantasy-comedy . This film has none of the cast , nor storyline continuation , from either Troll film . An early script was made with the original cast in mind . In one scene in a bar , a banjo centric song from Troll 2 can be heard in the background . It is the only film in the Troll trilogy to be rated R , quite possibly because of Amato 's involvement . After a small town nuclear power plant dumps hazardous waste into a forest surrounding the small town , people begin dying in increasingly gruesome ways . People can not pinpoint the source of the deaths , until the EPA investigates , proving that the forests ' roots were mutated due to the waste , beginning to kill and eat people . The plants attempt to break loose , however the EPA arrives again and bulldozes the plants , killing them , leaving the possibility that some more plants may have survived . Originally slated for a U.S. theatrical release in 1990 , the film ended up as a straight-to-video release in 1993 by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment . It is also available for instant streaming through Netflix under its alternate name , Contamination .7 .

Yttrium oxide is Y2O3 . It is an air-stable , white solid substance . Yttrium oxide is used as a common starting material for both materials science as well as inorganic compounds . It is the most important yttrium compound and is widely used to make YVO4 europium and Y2O3 europium phosphors that give the red color in color TV picture tubes . Yttrium oxide is also used to make yttrium iron garnets , which are very effective microwave filters . This synthesis is typically conducted at 800 Â C. The thermal conductivity of yttrium oxide is 27 W \/ ( mÂ K ) . Yttrium oxide is an important starting point for inorganic compounds . For organometallic chemistry it is converted to YCl3 in a reaction with concentrated hydrochloric acid and ammonium chloride . Y2O3 ceramics is a prospective solid-state laser material . In particular , lasers with ytterbium as dopant allow the efficient operation both in cw operation and in pulsed regimes . At high concentration of excitations ( of order of 1 % ) and poor cooling , the quenching of emission at laser frequency and avalanche broadband emission takes place .

The Free State of Thuringia is a state of Germany , located in the central part of the country . It is known as the `` green heart of Germany '' , due to the dense forest that covers the terrain . It has an area of and 2.29 million inhabitants , making it the sixth smallest by area and the fifth smallest by population of Germany 's sixteen states . The capital is Erfurt . From the Northwest going clockwise , Thuringia borders on the German states of Lower Saxony , Saxony-Anhalt , Saxony , Bavaria and Hesse . The ridges of the western Harz Mountains divide the region from Lower Saxony on the north-west , while the eastern Harz similarly separates Thuringia from the state of Saxony-Anhalt to the north-east . To the south and southwest , the Thuringian Forest effectively separates the ancient region of Franconia , now the northern part of Bavaria , from the rolling plains of most of Thuringia . The central Harz range extends southwards along the western side into the northwest corner of the Thuringian Forest region , making Thuringia a lowland basin of rolling plains nearly surrounded by ancient somewhat-difficult mountains . To the west across the mountains and south is the drainage basin of the Rhine River . The most conspicuous geographical feature of Thuringia is the Thuringian Forest , a mountain chain in the southwest . The Werra River , a tributary of the Weser River , separates this mountain chain from the volcanic RhÃ n Mountains , which are partially in Thuringia , Bavaria , and Hesse . In the northwest , Thuringia includes a small part of the Harz . The eastern part of Thuringia is generally a plain . The Saale River runs through these lowlands from south to north . The geographic center of the Federal Republic is located in Thuringia , near the municipality of Niederdorla . See also List of places in Thuringia . Each of the urban districts contains a town of the same name ( see table below , `` Towns in Thuringia '' ) . Named after the Thuringii tribe who occupied it ca . AD 300 , Thuringia came under Frankish domination in the 6th century , forming a part of the subsequent Holy Roman Empire . Thuringia became a landgraviate in 1130 . After the extinction of the reigning Ludowingian line of counts in 1247 and the War of the Thuringian Succession ( 1247 â `` 1264 ) , the western half became independent under the name of Hesse , never to become a part of Thuringia again . Most of the remaining Thuringia came under the rule of the Wettin dynasty of the nearby Margraviate of Meissen , the nucleus of the later Electorate and Kingdom of Saxony . With the division of the house of Wettin in 1485 , Thuringia went to the senior Ernestine branch of the family , which subsequently subdivided the area into a number of smaller states , according to the Saxon tradition of dividing inheritance amongst male heirs . These were the `` Saxon duchies '' , consisting , among others , of the states of Saxe-Weimar , Saxe-Eisenach , Saxe-Jena , Saxe-Meiningen , Saxe-Altenburg , Saxe-Coburg , and Saxe-Gotha ; Thuringia became merely a geographical concept . Thuringia generally accepted the Protestant Reformation . The Catholic faith was abolished as early as 1520 ; priests that remained loyal were driven away and churches and monasteries were largely destroyed , especially during the German Peasants ' War of 1525 . In MÃ 1\/4 hlhausen and elsewhere , the Anabaptists found many adherents . Thomas MÃ 1\/4 ntzer , a leader of some non-peaceful groups of this sect , was active in this city . Within the borders of Thuringia the Catholic faith was maintained only in the district called Eichsfeld , which was ruled by the Archbishop of Mainz , and to a small degree in the city and vicinity of Erfurt . Some reordering of the Thuringian states occurred during the German Mediatisation from 1795 â `` 1814 , and the territory was included within the Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine organized in 1806 . The 1815 Congress of Vienna confirmed these changes and the Thuringian states ' inclusion in the German Confederation ; the Kingdom of Prussia also acquired some Thuringian territory and administered it within the Province of Saxony . The Thuringian duchies which became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the Prussian-led unification of Germany were Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach , Saxe-Meiningen , Saxe-Altenburg , Saxe-Coburg-Gotha , Schwarzburg-Sondershausen , Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and the two principalities of Reuss Elder Line and Reuss Younger Line . In 1920 , after World War I , these small states merged into one state , called Thuringia ; only Saxe-Coburg voted to join Bavaria instead . Weimar became the new capital of Thuringia . The coat of arms of this new state was simpler than they had been previously . After July 1945 , the state of Thuringia came under the Soviet occupation zone , and was expanded to include parts Prussian Saxony , such as the areas around Erfurt , MÃ 1\/4 hlhausen , and Nordhausen . Erfurt became the new capital of Thuringia . In 1952 , the German Democratic Republic dissolved its states , and created districts ( Bezirke ) instead . The three districts that shared the territory of Thuringia were based in Erfurt , Gera and Suhl . The State of Thuringia was restored with slightly altered borders during Germany 's reunification in 1990 . Turnout was 56.2 % . SPD and CDU formed a coalition seven weeks after the election . Evangelical Church in Germany 25.1 % , Catholic Church 7.8 % .
REN21 , the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century , is a policy network that provides a forum for international leadership in renewable energy policy , in order to share knowledge and facilitate the rapid growth of renewable energy technologies in developing countries and industrialised economies . The network was launched in June 2005 as a result of discussion held the previous year at the International Conference for Renewable Energies in Bonn , Germany . Its secretariat operates from offices in Paris , France , and is provided by the United Nations Environment Programme and the Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ 1\/4 r Technische Zusammenarbeit ( German Technical Cooperation ) , in collaboration with the International Energy Agency . Like the Bonn Conference , REN21 distinguishes itself through its flexible nature and multi-stakeholder participation intended to provide a dynamic alternative to the official international fora . Its participants and members are drawn from a wide variety of bodies , including national and local governments , international associations and institutions , NGOs , the private sector , relevant partnerships and scientific panels , and other interested parties . REN21 has produced a number of internationally recognized reports on renewable energy policy and the development of the renewables marketplace . Since 2005 REN21 has produced an annual Renewables Global Status Report , with Eric Martinot and Janet Sawin as lead authors .
Michael A. Thalbourne , Ph. D. , ( born 24 March 1955 ; died 4 May 2010 ) was an Australian psychologist and parapsychologist . He was educated at the University of Adelaide and the University of Edinburgh . His books include : A glossary of terms used in parapsychology ( 2003 ) , The common thread between ESP and PK ( 2004 ) , and Parapsychology in the Twenty-First Century : Essays on the future of Psychical Research ( 2005 ) . Thalbourne obtained his B.A. ( Hons ) at the University of Adelaide , South Australia , in 1976 , and his Ph. D. in parapsychology at Edinburgh University in 1981 . Thalbourne was a Visiting Research Fellow at the University of Adelaide from 1992 until 2007 , and was President of the Australian Institute for Parapsychological Research . He was editor of the Australian Journal of Parapsychology . Thalbourne extensively researched the psychology of belief in the paranormal , as well as attempted to elicit the paranormal itself under laboratory conditions . In the 1990s he wrote on the concept of transliminality ; his early work suggesting that this could be a trait linking such personality variables as belief in the paranormal , creative personality , mystical experience and psychopathology led him to describe this as a `` common thread '' linking these variables . His later work looked at the relationship between religiosity , dream-interpretation and transliminality and also how transliminality may relate to traits such as psychoticism . Thalbourne constructed a questionnaire which , as with Hood 's M-Scale , assesses mystical experience called the Mystical Experience Scale . Thalbourne also collaborated on empirical research projects with Erlendur Haraldsson . Thalbourne also conducted research into kundalini . He published a scale to assess the kundalini experience with the world-renowned expert on panic attacks , Bronwyn Fox . More recently , he used a random number generator in connection with kundalini . In his paper of 2006 , he stated that he understands the term `` Kundalini '' to mean `` the coiled one '' , and he refers to research into the near-death experience in connection with kundalini , and also refers to the Physio-Kundalini Scale , the 19-item scale devised by Bruce Greyson to assess kundalini experience .
The third HMS Supply was a Royal Navy armed tender launched in 1759 which played an important part in the foundation of Australia . Oldest and smallest of the First Fleet ships , she was built in 1759 as an armed trader , of 175 tons , and had carried naval supplies between the Thames and Channel ports for 27 years . She left Portsmouth on 13 May 1787 , and arrived at Botany Bay on 18 January 1788 . She was captained by Henry Lidgbird Ball and the surgeon was James Callam . After the establishment of the initial settlement at Port Jackson , she was the link between the colony and Norfolk Island , making 10 trips . Following the loss of Sirius in 1790 she became the colony 's only link with the outside world . On 17 April 1790 she was sent to Batavia for supplies , returning on 19 September , having chartered a Dutch vessel , the Waaksamheid , to follow with more stores . Supply left Port Jackson on 26 November 1791 and sailed via Cape Horn reaching Plymouth on 21 April 1792 . She was bought at auction in July 1792 , renamed Thomas and Nancy , and carried coal in the Thames area until 1806 .
The Trolleybus Museum at Sandtoft is a transport museum which specialises in the preservation of trolleybuses . It is located by the village of Sandtoft , near Belton on the Isle of Axholme in the English county of Lincolnshire . The museum occupies part of the former RAF Sandtoft , an operational bomber base during the Second World War . RAF Sandtoft was disposed of by the RAF in 1958 and the site was acquired for the museum in November 1969 . Since that time , volunteers have transferred a barren site into a museum with the addition of workshop , vehicle depot and exhibition building . The first event held was the Sandtoft Gathering in 1971 , an event which is still held annually . The museum is recognized as having the largest collection of preserved trolleybuses in Europe , if not the world , with over 60 examples . Whilst the exhibits are predominantly from the UK , a collection of international examples is growing at the museum . Apart from trolleybuses and transport , the museum also features a collection of 1950s\/60s memorabilia . Over the years , many items related to the trolleybus era have been donated . A 1950s\/1960s street scene features shop windows , complete with displays , whilst the prefab utility bungalow , previously used as the Museum 's souvenir shop , has now been fitted out as a home to show even more of these period artefacts . The museum is open on selected days only . See website for details of dates .
Larissa ( , or as in Greek Î Î Ï Î Ï Î ) , also known as Neptune VII , is the fifth-closest inner satellite of Neptune . It is named after Larissa , a lover of Poseidon ( Neptune ) in Greek mythology and eponymous nymph of the city in Thessaly . It was first discovered by Harold J. Reitsema , William B. Hubbard , Larry A. Lebofsky and David J. Tholen , based on fortuitous ground-based stellar occultation observations on May 24 , 1981 , given the temporary designation S\/1981 N 1 and announced on 29 May 1981 . The moon was recovered and confirmed to be the only object in its orbit during the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989 after which it received the additional designation S\/1989 N 2 on August 2 , 1989 . The announcement by Stephen P. Synnott spoke of â 10 frames taken over 5 daysâ , which gives a recovery date sometime before July 28 . The name was given on 16 September 1991 . The fourth-largest satellite of Neptune , Larissa is irregular ( non-spherical ) in shape and appears to be heavily cratered , with no sign of any geological modification . Little else is known about it . It is likely that Larissa , like the other satellites inward of Triton , is a rubble pile re-accreted from fragments of Neptune 's original satellites , which were smashed up by perturbations from Triton soon after that moon 's capture into a very eccentric initial orbit . Larissa 's orbit is circular but not perfect and lies below Neptune 's synchronous orbit radius , so it is slowly spiralling inward due to tidal deceleration and may eventually impact Neptune 's atmosphere , or break up into a planetary ring upon passing its Roche limit due to tidal stretching .
Tosh .0 ( pronounced ) is an American television series hosted by comedian Daniel Tosh , who provides sarcastic commentary on online video clips , society , celebrities , and other parts of popular culture . Tosh .0 premiered on Comedy Central on June 4 , 2009 , starring Daniel Tosh . It focuses on Internet viral videos , sharing a set-up similar to that of Web Soup . The first season proved a surprise hit , averaging over a million viewers per episode . Within 10 weeks of its premiere , Tosh .0 became the second most watched cable network show in its time slot among 18 -- 34-year-old males , a sought after advertising demographic . The show was originally scheduled for only 10 episodes , but as its popularity increased , Comedy Central extended the first season to 16 episodes . On December 2009 , it was announced that Comedy Central had renewed the show for a full second season , with 25 episodes . The second season was set to debut on January 13 , 2010 . On April 8 , 2010 , Comedy Central confirmed that the show has been renewed for a third season . It began on January 11 , 2011 , but was put on break 10 episodes into the season on March 15 , 2011 . The show will return and air nine more episodes starting May 17 , 2011 , and finish out the season with eleven more episodes in September . In June 2010 , the summer season premiere of the show was the # 1 show on its timeslot among men within the ages of 18-24 . With nearly 2 million viewers , the episode was the most-watched episode of the series . The record was short-lived , however , as the July 7 episode held the attention of 2.4 million viewers , and the July 28 episode attracted 2.7 million viewers , again winning the time slot and also being the most-watched show on television that day among men 18-24 , 18-34 , and 25-34 . The July 28 episode was also the top cable show that night for adults 18-49 . Each episode begins with a cold open of a clip from an online video . Tosh makes humorous comments about the video , and proceeds to do so for a selection of other videos and\/or pictures . During this time , for one video or picture , he sees how many comments he can `` post '' about it , acting as if he were commenting on a video sharing site such as YouTube , stating he gives himself `` 20 seconds '' . He noted , however , in the second season , that the `` 20 seconds '' `` ends when I run out of jokes '' . The last video in this section will go into a `` Video Breakdown '' segment , where Tosh discusses various elements of said video , pausing several times to comment . Most episodes feature a `` Web Redemption '' , where Tosh invites a person or group that has a video on the Internet to be on the show . Usually , the video features the person in an embarrassing situation . They are invited to explain their video , interact with Tosh , and recreate the video . During the recreation , the guests will try to place themselves in a more positive light . In one of the web redemptions , Tosh pretends to spend days trapped in an elevator with Nick White , whose 41 hours trapped in a New York elevator were chronicled by The New Yorker and posted on You Tube in 2008 . Besides the Web Redemption , there has also been a `` Web Reunion '' , in which a group that Tosh has enjoyed is invited to perform again for the show , a `` Web Remix '' , in which a music artist is invited to remix a song they wrote , and a `` Web Investigation '' , in which Tosh investigates a confusing video by interviewing the subject of the video . One episode had a `` Web Retreat '' where he went hiking with Paul Vasquez from the viral video Double Rainbow . Other recurring segments include a segment `` Is it Racist ? '' , where Tosh invites people to vote on any racial stereotypes presented in a video . There is also a `` Viewer Video of the Week '' , where viewers of the show can submit their own movies to be shown on the air . The rest of the content in an episode varies , whether it is a video presented by a celebrity guest , a random video that is presented as a weekly video despite it being the only one ( `` Topless Pogo Stunt of the Week '' , `` Pedophile of the Week '' , etc. ) , or Tosh attempting to recreate a video . Just before the final commercial break , there is a moment where Tosh references a since canceled Comedy Central show by name ( for example `` We 'll be right back with more Shorties Watchin ' Shorties . '' ) . During the live broadcasts of his show , Daniel Tosh invites viewers on the East Coast to join him in `` live tweeting '' when he chats with fans via his Twitter account .

Tenerife South Airport , previously known as Tenerife South-Reina Sofia Airport , is one of two international airports located on the island of Tenerife , the largest of the Canary Islands ( the second one being Tenerife North Airport ) . Between its opening and the end of 2006 , a total of 173,912,207 passengers passed through the airport . The airport is the busiest of the two Tenerife airports . The airport is located in the municipality of Granadilla de Abona and was inaugurated on 6 November 1978 , by Queen SofÃ a of Spain , to whom the airport is dedicated ; by the end of its first year , 1 million passengers had passed through its doors . Tenerife South handled over 7.3 million passengers in 2010 . Combined with Tenerife North Airport , the island gathers the highest passenger movement in the Canary Islands with 11,410,305 passengers . In the late sixties , the island authorities of Tenerife said they needd a new airport at a new location as the existing airport did not meet technical requirements due to adverse weather conditions . In 1977 , the control tower , Terminal building and taxiways were completed . The airport was opened by Queen SofÃ a on 6 November 1978 . The first flight was an Iberia running flight IB187 from Lanzarote , which was operated by a DC-9 . The flight landed at 10:17 .
The Lady Penrhyn was a First Fleet transport ship of 333 tons , built on the River Thames in 1786 . Her master , William Cropton Sever , was part-owner . John Turnpenny Altree was surgeon to the convicts , and Arthur Bowes Smyth was surgeon to the ship . She left Portsmouth on 13 May 1787 , carrying 101 female convicts , and arrived at Port Jackson , Sydney , Australia , on 26 January 1788 . She had been chartered by the British East India Company , and left Port Jackson on 5 May 1788 to sail to China for a cargo of tea . She arrived back in England in mid August 1789 . The Lady Penrhyn was part-owned by London alderman and sea-biscuit manufacturer William Curtis . Curtis was a Lord Mayor of London of the 1790s , who sent a regular tea ship to China . Curtis was affectionally known as ` Billy Biscuit ' because of his family links to sea biscuit manufacture . Curtis ' speech about reading , ` riting and ` rithmatic ' , belied his literacy level which did n't have a lot to do with his success in life . The list of stores unloaded from the Lady Penrhyn on 25 March 1788 at Port Jackson has been widely quoted in books on the First Fleet . In Sydney Cove 1788 by John Cobley the amount of rice unloaded is given as 8 bram . This amount has been repeated in various books on the First Fleet . Bram , however , is not a unit of measurement and the original log entry lists the amount of rice as 8 barrels . The Lady Penrhyn carried the first horses that came to Australia , which it is thought consisted of one stallion , one colt , three mares and two fillies from Cape Town , South Africa .
Layyah , also spelt Leiah ( Urdu : ) , is the capital city of the Layyah District in the Punjab province of Pakistan . It is located at 30 Â 58 ' 0N 70 Â 56 ' 0E with an altitude of 143 metres ( 472 feet ) . The town was founded around 1550 by Kamal Khan , a Mirani Baloch and a descendant of the founder of Dera Ghazi Khan . Around 1610 , the town was taken from the Mirani rulers by the Jaskani Balochs , who held it until 1787 . Abdun Nabi Sarai was appointed governor by Timur Shah Durrani , but three years later it was included in the governorship of Muhammad Khan Sadozai , who transferred his seat of government to Mankera . In 1794 , Humayun Shah , the rival claimant to the throne of Kabul , was captured near Layyah and brought into the town , where his eyes were put out by order of Zaman Shah . Under the Sikh government , the town once more became the center of administration for the neighbouring area , and after the British occupation in 1849 , was for a time the headquarters of the District . In 1861 however , the District was broken up , and Layyah became a part of Dera Ismail Khan . In 1901 it was transferred to the new District of Mianwali . In 1875 , Layyah became a municipality , with income acquired through octroi , cross-municipality customs barriers . This income in the ten years up to 1902-3 averaged Rs . 9,900 with an expenditure of Rs . 10,100 . By 1903-4 income was Rs . 10,000 , and expenditure Rs . 10,600 . The chief industry of Layyah at that time was the manufacture of blankets . The town contained a dispensary and a municipal Anglo-vernacular middle school . At the 1901 census , Layyah 's population was 7,546 .
Spirochaetes ( also spelled Spirochetes ) belong to a phylum of distinctive Gram-negative bacteria , which have long , helically coiled ( spiral-shaped ) cells . Spirochetes are chemoheterotrophic in nature , with lengths between 5 and 250 Â m and diameters around 0.1-0 .6 Â m . Spirochaetes are distinguished from other bacterial phyla by the location of their flagella , sometimes called axial filaments , which run lengthwise between the bacterial inner membrane and outer membrane in periplasmic space . These cause a twisting motion which allows the spirochaete to move about . When reproducing , a spirochaete will undergo asexual transverse binary fission . Most spirochaetes are free-living and anaerobic , but there are numerous exceptions . The spirochetes are divided into three families ( Brachyspiraceae , Leptospiraceae , and Spirochaetaceae ) , all placed within a single order ( Spirochaetales ) . Disease-causing members of this phylum include the following : Cavalier-Smith has postulated that the Spirochaetes belong in a larger clade called Gracilicutes . Salvarsan , the first partially organic antimicrobial drug in medical history , was effective against spirochaetes only and was primarily used to cure syphilis . It has been suggested by biologist Lynn Margulis that eukaryotic flagella were derived from symbiotic spirochaetes , but few biologists accept this , as there is no close structural similarity between the two .
The British Rail Class 108 diesel multiple units were built by BR Derby from 1958 to 1961 , with a final production quantity of 333 vehicles . These units stayed in regular service until 1990 , when they began to be withdrawn from traffic . They were replaced on regional services by the new `` Sprinter '' derivative units , or by `` Turbo '' units on services around London . The final units lasted in traffic until October 1993 , although many saw further use in departmental service , as sandite or route-learner units . Good condition and lack of asbestos has ensured that many of this class have been saved for preservation . Many vehicles have been preserved on heritage railways .
Lamellibrachia is a genus of tube worms related to the giant tube worm , Riftia pachyptila . It lives at deep-sea cold seeps where hydrocarbons ( oil and methane ) are leaking out of the seafloor . It is entirely reliant on internal , sulfide-oxidizing bacterial symbionts for its nutrition . L. luymesi provides the bacteria with hydrogen sulfide and oxygen by taking them up from the environment and binding them to a specialized hemoglobin molecule . Unlike the tube worms that live at hydrothermal vents , Lamellibrachia uses a posterior extension of its body called the root to take up hydrogen sulfide from the seep sediments . Lamellibrachia may also help fuel the generation of sulfide by excreting sulfate through their roots into the sediments below the aggregations . The most well-known seeps where L. luymesi lives are in the northern Gulf of Mexico from 500 to 800 m depth . This tube worm can reach lengths of over 3 m ( 10 ft ) , and grows very slowly , with individuals living to be over 250 years old . It forms biogenic habitat by creating large aggregations of hundreds to thousands of individuals . Living in these aggregations are over a hundred different species of animals , many of which are found only at these seeps . While most species of vestimentiferan tubeworms live in deep waters below the photic zone , Lamellibrachia satsuma was discovered in Kagoshima Bay , Kagoshima at a depth of only 82 m , the shallowest depth record for a vestimentiferan .
Tilga is a village in Emmaste Parish , Hiiu County in northwestern Estonia .
A literacy test , in the context of United States political history , refers to the government practice of testing the literacy of potential citizens at the federal level , and potential voters at the state level . The federal government first employed literacy tests as part of the immigration process in 1917 . Southern state legislatures employed literacy tests as part of the voter registration process as early as the late nineteenth century . Literacy tests , along with poll taxes and extra-legal intimidation , , were used to deny suffrage to African-Americans in a number of southern states , while allowing many illiterate whites to vote . This was accomplished by making the test inordinately difficult and allowing test-givers to choose who had to take the test and who did not . Most African-Americans in the south were effectively disenfranchised from the 1890s until the 1960s . Southern states abandoned the literacy test only when forced to do so by federal legislation in the 1960s . The Civil Rights Act of 1964 provided that literacy tests used as a qualification for voting in federal elections be administered wholly in writing and only to persons who had not completed six years of formal education . The Voting Rights Act of 1965 suspended the use of literacy tests in all states or political subdivisions in which less than 50 percent of voting-age residents were registered as of 1 November 1964 or had voted in the 1964 presidential election . In a series of cases , the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the legislation and restricted the use of literacy tests for non-English-speaking citizens . Since the passage of this legislation , black registration in the South has increased dramatically .
In medicine , mastectomy is the medical term for the surgical removal of one or both breasts , partially or completely . Mastectomy is usually done to treat breast cancer ; in some cases , women and some men believed to be at high risk of breast cancer have the operation prophylactically , that is , to prevent cancer rather than treat it . It is also the medical procedure carried out to remove breast cancer tissue in males . Alternatively , certain patients can choose to have a wide local excision , also known as a lumpectomy , an operation in which a small volume of breast tissue containing the tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue is removed to conserve the breast . Both mastectomy and lumpectomy are what are referred to as `` local therapies '' for breast cancer , targeting the area of the tumor , as opposed to systemic therapies such as chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , or immunotherapy . Traditionally , in the case of breast cancer , the whole breast was removed . Currently the decision to do the mastectomy is based on various factors including breast size , number of lesions , biologic aggressiveness of a breast cancer , the availability of adjuvant radiation , and the willingness of the patient to accept higher rates of tumor recurrences after lumpectomy and radiation . Outcome studies comparing mastectomy to lumpectomy with radiation have suggested that routine radical mastectomy surgeries will not always prevent later distant secondary tumors arising from micro-metastases prior to discovery , diagnosis , and operation . Mastectomy rates vary tremendously worldwide , as was documented by the 2004 ` Intergroup Exemestane Study ' , an analysis of surgical techniques used in an international trial of adjuvant treatment among 4,700 women with early breast cancer in 37 countries . The mastectomy rate was highest in central and eastern Europe at 77 % . The USA had the second highest rate of mastectomy with 56 % , western and northern Europe averaged 46 % , southern Europe 42 % and Australia and New Zealand 34 % . There are a variety of types of mastectomy in use , and the type that a patient decides to undergo ( or whether he or she will decide instead to have a lumpectomy ) depends on factors such as size , location , and behavior of the tumor ( if there is one ) , whether or not the surgery is prophylactic , and whether or not the patient intends to undergo reconstructive surgery . Mastectomy for breast cancer was performed at least as early as 548 A.D. , when it was proposed by the court physician Aetios of Amida to Theodora . She declined the surgery , and died a few months later .

Computer rage is a heightened physiological response with associated feelings of anger and frustration resulting from using a computer or other complex electronic device . It may result in the physical assault of the computer or similar item , possibly leading to the device incurring more damage than it had before . Computer rage may manifest itself in verbal abuse and occasionally physical violence towards the object , in some cases violent actions towards the hardware itself , usually either thumping the keyboard , shaking the monitor or banging the mouse on the table\/desk . In online interactions , enraged persons may flame and abuse other users , shouting at them through headsets , sending rude messages , or rage quit ( exiting a game prematurely out of anger ) . Computer rage may be caused by distress due to a hardware or software problem which the enraged person is unable to correct . Persons may bang or kick the computer in an attempt to get it to function normally , though this action carries the distinct risk of destroying the computer 's hard disk drive via a head crash . Another common occurrence of computer rage is whilst playing computer games , mainly first-person shooters and mmorpgs . Computer rage is normally induced when a gamer either fails an objective or is killed repeatedly . Tech support personnel and systems administrators may be subjected to customer 's anger at a malfunctioning system , commonly including the aforementioned verbal abuse . Computer Rage is also known as Nerd Rage or `` Taking a Duncan '' . Blue Screen of Death a very common precursor to computer rage .
Zinc sulfide ( or zinc sulphide ) is a chemical compound with the formula ZnS . Zinc sulfide is a white to yellow-colored powder or crystal . It is typically encountered in the more stable cubic form , known also as zinc blende or sphalerite . The hexagonal form is also known both as a synthetic material and as the mineral wurtzite . A tetragonal form is also known as very rare mineral polhemusite ( Zn , Hg ) S. Both sphalerite and wurtzite are intrinsic , wide-bandgap semiconductors . The cubic form has a band gap of 3.54 eV at 300 K whereas the hexagonal form has a band gap of 3.91 eV . The transition from the sphalerite form to the wurtzite form occurs at around 1020 Â C. The first time the phosphorescence of ZnS was observed by the French chemist ThÃ odore Sidot in 1866 . His findings were presented by the renowned chemist A. E. Becquerel who was involved in the research on luminescence and phosphorescence . ZnS was used by Ernest Rutherford and others in the early years of nuclear physics as a scintillation detector , because it emits light on excitation by x-rays or electron beam , making it useful for x-ray screens and cathode ray tubes . It also exhibits phosphorescence due to impurities on illumination with blue or ultraviolet light . Zinc sulfide , with addition of few ppm of suitable activator , is used as phosphor in many applications , from cathode ray tubes through x-ray screens to glow in the dark products . When silver is used as activator , the resulting color is bright blue , with maximum at 450 nm . Manganese yields an orange-red color at around 590 nm . Copper provides long glow time and the familiar glow-in-the-dark greenish color . Copper doped zinc sulfide ( ZnS + Cu ) is used also in electroluminescent panels . Zinc sulfide is also used as an infrared optical material , transmitting from visible wavelengths to over 12 micrometres . It can be used planar as an optical window or shaped into a lens . It is made as microcrystalline sheets by the synthesis from hydrogen sulfide gas and zinc vapor and sold as FLIR ( Forward Looking IR ) grade ZnS a pale milky yellow visibly opaque form . This material when hot isostatically pressed ( HIPed ) can be converted to a water-clear form known as Cleartran ( trademark ) . Early commercial forms were marketed as Irtran-2 but this designation is now obsolete . It can be doped as both n-type semiconductor and p-type semiconductor , which is unusual for the II-VI semiconductors . ZnS is a covalently bonded solid . It is easily produced by mixing an amount of zinc and sulfur and then igniting it . The result ( after cooling ) is zinc sulfide . Zinc sulfide is insoluble in water and solutions containing Zn2 + readily precipitate ZnS in the presence of sulfide ions ( e.g. , from H2S ) . Zn2 + + S2 â ' â ' ZnS This has formed the basis of a gravimetric analysis for zinc . It is produced in quantity from zinc oxide as a by-product of the synthesis of ammonia from methane .
Braine-le-Comte is a Walloon municipality located in the Belgian province of Hainaut . On January 1 , 2006 , Braine-le-Comte had a total population of 20,305 . The total area is 84.68 kmÂ which gives a population density of 240 inhabitants per kmÂ . The RonquiÃ res inclined plane at the Canal du Centre is in the municipality of Braine-Le Comte . On August 3 , 1692 , during the Nine Years War , the French army defeated a joint British-Dutch-German army in the Battle of Steenkerque in the current municipality of Braine-le-Comte .
Shuzo Matsuoka , ( November 6 , 1967 - ) born in Tokyo , Japan , is a former professional tennis player from Japan . Matsuoka turned professional in 1986 . In 1989 , he finished runner-up in the top-level tournament at Wellington , and captured the doubles title in Auckland . In 1992 , Matsuoka became the first Japanese player to win a singles event on the ATP Tour when he captured the title in Seoul . He was also runner-up at the prestigious grass court tournament at Queen 's Club that year . Matsuoka 's best performance at a Grand Slam event came at Wimbledon in 1995 , where he reached the quarter-finals before being knocked out by pete sampras 's after four sets 6-7 , 6-3 , 6-4 , 6 â `` 2 . Matsuoka 's serve gave sampras fits in the first set and even earn three break point in second set 3-3 , it looked to be on his way to the semifinals until sampras solved the puzzle that was Matsuoka 's serve . Matsuoka was unable to subdue the defending blows in the next 3 sets . At the US Open in 1995 , Matsuoka was left writhing in pain on court while suffering from a severe case of leg cramps during his first round match against Petr Korda . The rules at the time meant that Matsuoka would have forfeited the match if he had gotten medical attention , so he was left to suffer until he was defaulted for delaying the match . The incident led to a change in the rules of professional tennis to allow players to receive medical treatment for cramps during matches . Matsuoka 's career-high world rankings were World No. 46 in singles ( in 1992 ) and World No. 95 in doubles ( in 1989 ) . His career prize-money earnings totalled US$ 1,117,112 . He retired from the professional tour in April 1998 . Since his retirement from tennis Matsuoka has become a popular television sports commentator in Japan . He hosts the `` Shuzo Challenge '' , an annual tennis camp for young children by the JTA . Kei Nishikori , Japan 's current No. 1 , attended the camp when he was 12 years old . Known for his passionate and energetic character , Matsuoka has also appeared in numerous variety programs , as well as in a cameo role for a television drama series . In 2008 Matsuoka was featured in ten television commercials , tying him with Takuya Kimura for the celebrity to be featured in the most number of television commercials that year . He has become something of an internet meme on video sharing websites such as Nico Nico Douga and YouTube , where users create MAD movies out of videos found on the front page of his official site . Matsuoka married former TV Tokyo announcer Emiko Taguchi in 1998 , and has three children . His father , Isao Matsuoka , is chairman of Tohota Co. , Ltd. , the Japanese film studio known for its Godzilla movies as well as numerous Akira Kurosawa films .
`` Your Body Is a Wonderland '' is the second single released by John Mayer from his first album , 2001 's Room for Squares . Its commercial success was greater than Mayer 's prior single , `` No Such Thing . '' The song has been rumored to have been inspired by actress\/singer Jennifer Love Hewitt ; However , it was written and initially recorded long before the two even met . Mayer once said during his `` As\/Is '' tour , that the song was about `` girly parts '' , but this was later denied . During his `` VH1 Storytellers '' performance , Mayer stated that he wrote the song about his first girlfriend at age 14 . According to the liner notes , a toy piano is used as an instrument in the song . The line `` I 'm never speaking up again '' , sung in the background , is also prominently featured in the chorus to the song `` My Stupid Mouth '' , which appears just before the song on Room For Squares . All songs are written by John Mayer except where noted otherwise . Billboard said the song showcases Mayer 's `` smooth , casual singing style and barroom instrumentation . '' In 2003 , `` Your Body Is a Wonderland '' won Mayer the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance . The song ranked at # 28 on Blender magazine 's list of the `` 50 Worst Songs Ever '' . The video starred the actress Holly Lynch . In 2006 , the song was used in an episode of U.S. version of The Office , entitled `` A Benihana Christmas '' . Characters Michael Scott and Andy Bernard sing the song as a karaoke duet . Mayer agreed to let the show use the song , in exchange for a Dundie , which was for `` Tallest Music Dude '' . Lance Bass and Lacey Schwimmer performed a rumba to the song on Season 7 of Dancing with the Stars .
The stern is the rear or aft part of a ship or boat , technically defined as the area built up over the sternpost , extending upwards from the counter to the taffrail . The stern lies opposite of the bow , the foremost part of a ship . The stern side of a vessel is indicated with a white navigation light at night . In modern cruise ships , the stern is frequently the location of the dining room , so as to provide uninterrupted views of the sea . In modern warships , particularly cruisers and destroyers , the stern is usually where the helipad is located . The stern tends to be lower set when compared to other parts of the ship , and may contain a large caliber gun mount or Cruise missile missile Magazine ( firearm ) magazines . The stern is usually subject to gunfire or cannonballs . Aircraft carriers typically use the deck space in the stern part of the ship for the recovery of incoming aircraft . Aircraft carriers may have aircraft elevators in the stern area to prevent interference of flight operations , which are launched from the bow ( ship ) bow . For submarines , both fast attack and ballistic missile , the stern is generally the location of the engine room and the motor room , if the submarine has one . If the submarine runs on nuclear power the stern may contain a heat exchanger and other parts associated with a nuclear reactor .
Lelystad is a municipality and a city in the center of the Netherlands , and it is the capital of the province of Flevoland . The city , built on reclaimed land , was founded in 1967 and was named after Cornelis Lely , who engineered the Afsluitdijk , making the reclamation possible . Lelystad is approximately 5 metres ( 16 ft ) below sea level . Lelystad is the largest municipality in the Netherlands in area , but a large part of that area is water : Markermeer and IJsselmeer . Another major area is the internationally famous nature park of Oostvaardersplassen , which arose naturally when the polder of South Flevoland was drained . Lelystad is also surrounded by a square of woodlands and parks and flat farmland . The location of the city makes weather and skies especially beautiful . The importance of the landscape and sky is emphasized by several pieces of land art : engineers ' work and works such as the Observatorium by Robert Morris ( see below ) . Lelystad hosts many one-day events like the Airshow Lelystad , the Waterfestival , the National oldtimerday , speedwayraces , Architecture day and several sports events . On the Midland Circuit many motor - , karting - and stock car racing events and several autoclub meetings are held . On the coast there are several marinas . Lelystad has a good infrastructure . Lelystad can be reached by air , water , and land . The honeycomb grid in the arms of Lelystad pictures the dykes , built with six-edged concrete or basalt blocks . The color gold indicates the high costs of the project of making the polder . The center shield is the arms of engineer Cornelis Lely . The sealions reflect the history of the land . In the flag , the fleur-de-lis ( lily ) again takes a central point , referring to the name Lely . The yellow ( golden ) background reflects the precious land , and the blue lines the dykes and waterways . The flag of the province is similarly adorned with the fleur-de-lis to commemorate Lely . Lelystad is built on the seabed of the former Zuiderzee . About 6500 years ago this wetland was above high tide level and inhabited ; the Netherlands have steadily subsided since . Near Lelystad at Swifterbant , the oldest human skeletons in Western Europe were discovered . Due to rising water levels and storms , the peatlands were washed away , and the Lacus Flevo ( in Roman times ) grew to be the Almere ( Middle Ages ) and became the Zuiderzee . The Zuiderzee ( Southern Sea ) was the main transport route from Amsterdam to the North Sea and the Hanseatic League cities . Due to the many shipwrecks in Flevoland , Lelystad now houses the National Centre for Maritime History , with a museum and the shipyard that has built the Batavia replica . After the Second World War the Zuiderzee Works continued , constructing the polder of Eastern Flevoland . In 1950 work commenced on several construction islands in the middle of the IJsselmeer . Lelystad-Haven was the largest island , and its wooden barracks housed a community of dyke-builders . In 1955 they reached the mainland , which made it possible to drive to Lelystad by car . One of the three pumping stations , which drained the polder in June 1957 , was the diesel-powered Wortman in Lelystad-Haven . Until 1967 the only inhabitants of Lelystad were technical engineers and workmen and superintendents , living on the former construction island . For more information on Lelystad 's history , visit the Nieuw Land Heritage Centre . As mentioned above , the Hanzelijn project is a planned railway line from Lelystad to Dronten , Kampen and Zwolle . The Zuiderzeelijn is a projected railway which could connect Lelystad with Emmeloord , Heerenveen and Groningen . In one variation the Zuiderzeelijn would be a magnetic levitation train line providing a faster connection between Amsterdam and Groningen . Another more realistic variation would be a conventional electrified train track allowing speeds up to 200 km\/h . Other plans for the near future include the development of the coastal area ( Lelystad borders both the Markermeer and the IJsselmeer ) for tourist and commercial purposes .
In Finnish mythology , Ukko , in Estonian mythology Uku , is a god of sky , weather , crops ( harvest ) and other natural things . He is the most significant god in Finnish and Estonian mythologies , and created the goddess Ilmatar , creator of the world . The Finnish word ukkonen , thunderstorm , is derived from his name . In the Kalevala he is also called Ylijumala ( the high god ) , as he is the god of things above . Other names for Ukko include PitkÃ nen ( pitkÃ , long ) , IsÃ inen ( isÃ , father ) , Isoinen ( iso , great ) and Ã ijÃ . He makes all his appearances in myths solely by natural effects when asked . He is the equivalent of Zeus in the Greek Pantheon , or Thor in the Norse pantheon with properties of Odin . The equivalent of Thor , Tuuri , was seldom encountered in the Finnish pantheon , and relegated only as deity of harvest and success . Ukko 's origins are probably in Baltic PerkÅ `` nas and the older Finnish sky god Ilmarinen . Thor is also associated with PerkÅ `` nas . While Ukko took Ilmarinen 's position as the Sky God , Ilmarinen 's destiny was to turn into a mortal smith-hero . Stories tell about Ilmarinen vaulting the sky-dome . Ukko 's weapon was a hammer called Ukonvasara ( Ukko 's Hammer ) , or an axe or a sword , by which he struck lightning ( see thunderbolt ) . While Ukko mated with his wife Akka , ( which consequently means `` old woman '' in modern Finnish , whereas `` ukko '' means `` old man '' ) the act created a thunderstorm . He also created thunderstorms by driving with his chariot through the skies . Ukko 's original weapon was probably the boat-shaped stone-axe of the battle-axe culture . A viper snake with a saw-figure on its skin is a symbol of thunder . There are stone carvings which have features of both snakes and lightning . Ukko was sometimes known as the same god as Perkele and as Ilmarinen , the blacksmith of Kalevala . His wife was Rauni the protecter of rowan tree , known as the Mother-Earth or Akka . Ukko also gave good luck for hunting .
The North Atlantic Treaty is the treaty that brought NATO into existence , signed in Washington , D.C. on April 4 , 1949 . The original twelve nations that signed it and thus became the founding members of NATO were : When German reunification occurred in 1990 , the country as a whole became a member of NATO . During the April 2008 summit , Croatia and Albania were officially invited to join NATO . They both signed the treaty and officially joined NATO on April 1 , 2009 . The key section of the treaty was Article V which committed each member state to consider an armed attack against one state to be an armed attack against all states . The treaty was created with an armed attack by the Soviet Union against Western Europe in mind , but the mutual self-defense clause was never invoked during the Cold War . Rather , it was invoked for the first time in 2001 in response to the September 11 , 2001 attacks against the World Trade Center and The Pentagon in Operation Eagle Assist . In the United States , the treaty was approved by the US Senate in a vote of 82 to 13 on July 21 , 1949 .
Bernard is a city in Dubuque County , Iowa , United States . It is part of the ` Dubuque , Iowa Metropolitan Statistical Area ' . The population was 97 at the 2000 census . Bernard is located at ( 42.313622 , -90.831073 ) . According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 0.1 square miles ( 0.2 kmÂ ) , all of it land .

Papyrus 46 ( in the Gregory-Aland numbering ) , designated by siglum 46 , is one of the oldest extant New Testament manuscripts in Greek , written on papyrus , with its ` most probable date ' between 175-225 . Some leaves are part of the Chester Beatty Biblical Papyri , and others are in the University of Michigan Papyrus Collection . 46 contains most of the Pauline epistles , though with some folios missing . According to the website Bible Research , it contains ( in order ) `` the last eight chapters of Romans ; all of Hebrews ; virtually all of 1 â `` 2 Corinthians ; all of Ephesians , Galatians , Philippians , Colossians ; and two chapters of 1 Thessalonians . All of the leaves have lost some lines at the bottom through deterioration . '' Folio size is approximately 28x16 cm with a single column of text averaging 11.5 cm . There are between 26 and 32 lines ( rows ) of text per page , although both the width of the rows and the number of rows per page increase progressively . Rows of text at the bottom of each page are damaged ( lacunose ) , with between 1-2 lines lacunose in the first quarter of the MS , 2-3 lines lacunose in the central half , and up to seven lines lacunose in the final quarter . The seven leaves missing from the papyrus ' beginning unquestionably contained the first half of Romans . However , the contents of the seven missing leaves from the papyrus ' end is uncertain . There would be enough space for 2 Thessalonians and possibly Philemon , but not for the Pastoral epistles . Kenyon calculates that 2 Thessalonians would require two leaves , leaving only five remaining leaves ( 10 pages ) for the remaining canonical Pauline literature â '' 1 Timothy ( estimated 8.25 pages ) , 2 Timothy ( 6 pages ) , Titus ( 3.5 pages ) and Philemon ( 1.5 pages ) â '' totaling ten required leaves ( 19.25 pages ) . Throughout Romans , Hebrews and the latter chapters of 1 Corinthians are found small and thick strokes or dots , usually agreed to be from the hand of a reader rather than the producer of the manuscript since the ink is always much paler than that of the text itself . They appear to mark sense divisions ( similar to verse numbering found in bibles ) and are also found in portions of 45 , possibly evidence of reading in the community which held both codices . 46 uses an extensive and well-developed system of nomina sacra . Griffin argued against Kim , in part , that such an extensive usage of the nomina sacra system nearly eliminates any possibility of the manuscript dating to the 1st century . He admitted , however , that Kim 's dating can not be ruled out on this basis alone , since the exact provenance of the nomina sacra system itself is not well-established . The provenance of the papyrus is unknown , although it was probably originally discovered in the ruins of an early Christian church or monastery . Following the discovery in Cairo , the manuscript was broken up by the dealer . Ten leaves were purchased by Chester Beatty in 1930 ; the University of Michigan acquired six in 1931 and 24 in 1933 . Beatty purchased 46 more in 1935 , and his acquisitions now form part of the Chester Beatty Biblical Papyri , eleven codices of biblical material . As with all manuscripts dated solely by paleography , the dating of 46 is uncertain . The first editor of parts of the papyrus , H. A. Sanders , proposed a date possibly as late as the second half of the 3rd century . F. G. Kenyon , a later editor , preferred a date in the first half of the 3rd century . The manuscript is now sometimes dated to about 200 . Young Kyu Kim has argued for an exceptionally early date of c. 80 . Griffin critiqued and disputed Kim 's dating , placing the ` most probable date ' between 175-225 , with a ' 95 % confidence interval ' for a date between 150-250 . This , they conclude , points to a date during the middle of the 2nd century for 46 .

Johnny Shines ( April 26 , 1915 â `` April 20 , 1992 ) was an American blues singer and guitarist . According to the music journalist Tony Russell , `` Shines was that rare being , a blues artist who overcame age and rustiness to make music that stood up beside the work of his youth . When Shines came back to the blues in 1965 he was 50 , yet his voice had the leonine power of a dozen years before , when he made records his reputation was based on '' . He was born John Ned Shines in Frayser , Tennessee . He spent most of his childhood in Memphis , Tennessee playing slide guitar at an early age in local â jukesâ and for tips on the streets . He was `` inspired by the likes of Charley Patton , Blind Lemon Jefferson , Lonnie Johnson , and the young Howlin ' Wolf '' , but he was taught to play the guitar by his mother . Shines moved to Hughes , Arkansas in 1932 and worked on farms for three years putting his musical career on hold . It was this chance meeting with Robert Johnson , his greatest influence , that gave him the inspiration to return to music . In 1935 , Shines began traveling with Johnson , touring the south and heading as far north as Ontario where they appeared on a local radio program . The two went their separate ways in 1937 , one year before Johnson 's death . Shines played throughout the southern United States until 1941 when he settled in Chicago . There Shines found work in the construction industry but continued to play in local bars . He made his first recording in 1946 for Columbia Records , but the takes were never released . He recorded for Chess in 1950 , and was once again denied release . He kept playing with local blues musicians in the Chicago area for several more years . In 1952 , Shines recorded what is considered his best work for the J.O.B. Records label . The recordings were a commercial failure and Shines , frustrated with the music industry , sold his equipment and returned to construction . In 1966 , Vanguard Records found Shines taking photographs in a Chicago blues club and had him record tracks for the third installment of Chicago\/The Blues\/Today ! The album has since then become a blues classic and it brought Shines into the mainstream music scene . Shines toured with the Chicago All Stars alongside Lee Jackson , Big Walter Horton and Willie Dixon . Shines moved to Holt , Alabama , in Tuscaloosa County , in 1969 . When a University of Alabama student , Natalie Mattson , learned that he was living in the area , she invited him to play at a coffee house , known as the `` Down Under , '' that she ran on campus . Shines played on several occasions , and also brought his friend , blues artist Mississippi Fred McDowell to appear with him at Down Under . These were some of his earliest appearances in Alabama after his move there . He continued to play the international blues circuit while living in Holt , Alabama . In the late 1960s and 1970s , Shines toured with Robert Johnson 's stepson , Robert Lockwood , Jr. as the last remaining original delta blues musicians . In 1980 , Shines ' music was brought to a standstill when he suffered a stroke . He would later appear , and play , in the 1991 documentary The Search for Robert Johnson and manage to release one last album , Back To The Country , which won a W.C. Handy Award . It featured playing from Snooky Prior and Johnny Nicholas . In 1989 Shines came to California to play a month long tour hitting universities ( UC Santa Cruz ) and clubs , ranging as far north as San Francisco 's `` Slims '' , where he played an acoustic set with David Schnittman backing him on guitar plus a mandolin player . For the rest of his shows Johnny used a local Santa Cruz CA blues band named `` Blue Magic '' . The band leader was the late Gary Martin ( guitar\/vocals ) David Schnittman ( Bass ) and Scott Cooper ( drums ) . Johnny had suffered a stroke a few years earlier but his voice retained its legendary power . However he could no longer `` fret '' his guitar with his left hand and played only `` slide '' guitar ; both on his acoustic and electric guitars . Johnny and the Blue Magic ranged as far south as the Belly Up club in San Diego and the `` Palomino Club in Los Angeles . At these two southern California dates Johnny shared the stage with Clarence `` Gatemouth '' Brown . There were also dates at the `` San Louis Obispo Blues Society '' as well as several other clubs . During this tour Blue Magic would typically play the opening set , followed by Johnny playing an acoustic solo set , followed by Johnny in front of the band for the 3rd set . Johnny performed the following year at the `` Fountain Blues Festival in San Jose CA '' and gave a lecture at San Jose State University on the history of the blues . Also , In 1989 , Shines met a young , Minnesota-born blues player , Kent Duchaine , and the two of them toured for the next several years until Shines ' death . Shines died on 20 April 1992 , in Tuscaloosa , Alabama . He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame later the same year .
Bengtzing ( born March 13 , 1974 ) grew up in GullspÃ ng , a little village in VÃ stra GÃ taland located in the west of Sweden ) . She released two singles in 1987 and 1989 , however , she disappeared from the music industry for fifteen years . In 2004 she took part in the fourth and the final season of Fame Factory but she went on the program at the same time as her song `` Alla flickor '' being selected to participate at Melodifestivalen 2005 . Her song surprised everyone and she took part in the Melodifestivalen final after receiving sufficient votes in the ` Andra Chansen ' ( Second Chance ) round . She finished in last place , scoring 15 jury points but receiving 0 points from the Swedish public 's televoting . The single reached # 8 in the Swedish charts and a few months `` Diamanter '' , a song very similar to Alla flickor , reached # 32 . One year later she appeared again in Melodifestivalen . Her song , `` Jag ljuger sÃ bra '' , written first for Jessica Andersson , finished in the top two of the first heat and , therefore , was entered into the final . Linda 's song came seventh out of 10 in the final in Stockholm 's Globen . Whilst Linda may not have received many votes from the public the single rose to # 2 in the Swedish charts , making it her greatest hit . Days before the Melodifestivalen 2006 final , she released her first album , `` Ingenting att fÃ rlora '' ( # 4 ) and months later the second single from the album , `` Kan du se '' debuted at # 7 , though did not chart the next week . In 2007 she released a new single , `` VÃ rsta schlagern '' , a parody on traditional Melodifestivalen entries . The song is rumored to have been entered into Melodifestivalen 2007 but was not selected as one of the 32 songs to compete for the title in the live shows . The song is a duet together with Markoolio . Linda participated at Melodifestivalen 2008 , competing in Heat 4 ( Karlskrona ) on the 1 March 2008 , where she directly qualified for the final round . She went on to finish fifth out of ten in the final , with 64 points from the juries but nothing from the public . The song was composed by Johan Fransson , Tim Larsson , Tobias Lundgren and is called Hur svÃ rt kan det va ? ( How hard can it be ? ) . Linda released her second album on the 19 February 2008 , 4 days after the Melodifestivalen final . It has been reported that Linda 's record company ( Mariann Records ) would not allow Linda to release her second album unless she entered Melodifestivalen 2008 . In 2011 she will once again compete in Melodifestivalen with the song `` E de fel pÃ mig '' .

In chemistry , the perbromate ion is the anion having the chemical formula . It is an oxyanion of bromine , the conjugate base of perbromic acid , in which bromine has the oxidation state +7 . Unlike its chlorine and iodine analogs ( perchlorate and periodate ) , it is difficult to synthesize . It has tetrahedral molecular geometry . The term perbromate also refers to a compound that contains the anion or the functional group . The perbromate ion is a strong oxidizing agent . The reduction potential for the BrO4 â ' \/ Brâ ' couple is +0.69 V at pH 14 . This is comparable to selenite 's reduction potential . Subsequently , it was successfully synthesized again by the electrolysis of , although only in low yield . Later , it was obtained by the oxidation of bromate with xenon difluoride . Once perbromates are obtained , perbromic acid can be produced by protonating . This synthesis is much easier to perform on a large scale than the electrolysis route or oxidation by xenon difluoride .
OmotesandÅ Station is a Tokyo Metro ( subway ) station located at the intersection of OmotesandÅ and Aoyama-dori in Minato , Tokyo , Japan . ( Part of the Chiyoda Line platforms extends into Shibuya . ) The station was opened as the terminus of the Tokyo Rapid Railway from Toranomon as Aoyama-rokuch Å me Station on November 18 , 1938 . It became a through station later that year when the section to Shibuya opened on December 20 . When through services from the Tokyo Underground Railway ( from Asakusa ) began on September 16 , 1939 the station became Jingumae Station . This makes it the only Tokyo Metro station to have been renamed twice . The Chiyoda line platforms opened on October 20 , 1972 , prompting a second name change to `` OmotesandÅ '' ( since there was a Meiji-jing Å `` mae station on the new line , closer to the actual shrine ) and the HanzÅ mon Line platforms opened on August 1 , 1978 . All platforms are wheelchair accessible . There is same-direction cross-platform interchange between the Ginza and HanzÅ mon lines , making this the most convenient transfer point on the Aoyama-d Å ri section of these lines . Passengers who wish to change to the TÅ kyÅ `` TÅ yoko Line , the JR lines or the KeiÅ Inokashira Line at Shibuya often change to the Ginza line here ; those who want the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line or the TÅ kyÅ `` Den-en-toshi Line change to the HanzÅ mon Line . Curiously , Ginza\/Hanz Å mon line passengers must exit the station by going down to the ticket gates ; they can not go directly up to the street .

Saint-Denis-du-Payr Ã is a commune in the VendÃ e department in the Pays de la Loire region in western France .
Holly Beach , also known as the `` Cajun Riviera '' , is a coastal community in unincorporated Cameron Parish , Louisiana , United States . Known for crabbing and a drive on the beach , this small Southwest Louisiana community mainly consisted of beach-front cabins called `` camps '' which , due to the threat of hurricanes , were `` built-to-be-rebuilt '' by its residents . It is part of the Lake Charles metropolitan area , which has a population of 194,138 . In September 2005 Hurricane Rita completely leveled the small beach town . Almost nothing was left but ruins and the water tower . This was the second time Holly Beach was devastated by a hurricane ; in 1957 Hurricane Audrey smashed ashore with a 12 foot storm surge . A year after the devastation of Hurricane Rita , Holly Beach was slowly coming back to life , with some residents living in mobile homes set up on-site . Many former residents believe the government officials are implementing such stringent building codes that it 's now nearly impossible to rebuild . Many of these dwellings are parked under canopy type structures for shade . The new telephone poles are set up carrying electricity , but are lined up ominously in the familiar rows , revealing the numerous empty lots . The current residents must sign a waiver which allows them to dwell there , despite the lack of a functioning sewer system which is a concern to the stateâ s department of health . It became common to see portable toilets on the communityâ s road sides , which are well maintained for the few locals and visitors alike . For new structures in Cameron Parish , the new building codes apply . In nearby Cameron , according to the parish officials , the coastal buildings built before the late 1980s that had less than fifty percent damage may retain the same pre-Rita elevation . It was estimated that some twenty-percent of these structures met the criteria and wouldnâ t have to have an elevation increase . But just how stringent the new building codes in Cameron and the surrounding parish will be enforced will be determined by surveyors using Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) flood maps . It was feared that these strict building codes , along with the high insurance costs , would keep many of the original locals from returning and rebuilding , and that the southern part of the parish would end up with temporary trailer type housing indefinitely . Within Holly Beach , there are several permanent structures being built , with pier elevations complying with building codes . These structures are a testament to those determined residents who will not give up their beachfront living to any force of nature , or any other opposition that is put between them and their `` Cajun Riviera '' . In September 2008 , Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike reflooded the area . It is located 10 miles west of Cameron and 12 miles east of Johnson Bayou . In 1991 , the town was immortalized as the subject of the nostalgic and humorous Swamp Pop song '' ( Holly Beach ) Under the Boardwalk '' by Kenny Tibbs ( Kenny Thibodeaux ) and The Jokers , released on Jin Records . In a close parody of the 1960s hit `` Under the Boardwalk '' by The Drifters , the lyrics explain that cajun vacationers `` ai n't got no boardwalk , just got seeweed , but we always pass a real good time at Holly Beach .

VÃ clav Benda ( August 8 , 1946 , Prague - June 2 , 1999 ) was a Czech political activist and mathematician . Along with other dissidents in the 1960s and 70s , Benda led the movement for greater political freedom and expression in the communist-dominated nation . His efforts were largely unsuccessful and led to constant harassment from authorities and social exclusion . In 1977 , the same year he became a signatory to Charter 77 , the Czech dissident movement group , he wrote in `` samizdat '' ( underground publishing ) fashion , a short seminal tract called `` Parallel Polis '' ( translated into English in 1978 ) . The purpose of the essay was to inject new life into the country 's moribund political life . In brief form , Parallel Polis was a philosophical call for his fellow dissidents to abandon hope that the repressed social , economic and political institutions in Czechoslovakia could be changed by protest . Instead , Benda urged that new `` parallel institutions '' be created that are more responsive to human needs and that may someday even supplant the existing corrupt ones . The entrenched communist state would simply drain any efforts at reform ; better to start new ones that waste energy fighting old ones . At its core , Parallel Polis is an inherently communal concept that shares profound philosophical ties to the early Christian movement that developed shortly after the death of Jesus . Much of this religious influence might have been the result of his deep and intense devotion to his Catholic faith . The idea was a lightning rod in the dissident community and landed Benda in jail for years as a result . Any notions of parallel institutions being created in Czechoslovakia were thus crushed . By the end of the 1980s and the coming of the Velvet Revolution that threw off communism , Parallel Polis as an idea vanished from the political scene . Only in recent years has it been revived , by a group of scholars at the University of Washington . In 1989 , Benda joined a Christian right-wing political party , Christian Democratic Party , which later merged with the Civic Democratic Party . He increasingly became a controversial figure within Czech society , and his politics roiled his former dissident comrades and may have isolated him politically . From June 25 to December 31 , 1992 Benda was Chairman of the Chamber of the Nations . The mid 1990s found him in charge of the Bureau for Investigating the Crimes of Communist Party officials . He took the role seriously and worked tirelessly , although judicial resistance and lack of governmental cooperation forced Benda to try criminals in the court of public opinion using the media . He sided with former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet . In 1996 , he was elected as senator to the Czech Parliament in district Prague 1 , a seat he held until his sudden death in 1999 .
Tabi are traditional Japanese socks . Ankle-high and with a separation between the big toe and other toes , they are worn by both men and women with zori , geta , and other traditional thonged footwear . Tabi are also essential with traditional clothingâ '' kimono and other wafuku . The most common color is white , and white tabi are worn in formal situations such as at tea ceremonies . Men sometimes wear blue or black tabi for traveling . Patterned and colored tabi are also available and are worn most often by women , though they are gaining popularity among men as well . In contrast to socks that , when pulled on , fit the foot snugly because of their elastic weave , tabi are sewn from cloth cut to form . They are open at the back so they can be slipped on and have a row of fasteners along the opening so they can be closed . Construction workers , farmers and gardeners , rickshaw-pullers , and other workmen often wear a type of tabi called jika-tabi . Made of heavier , tougher material and often having rubber soles , jika-tabi resemble boots and are outer footwear rather than socks . Like other tabi , jika-tabi are toe-divided so they can be worn with slip-on thonged footwear . Shojiro Ishibashi , the founder of major tire company Bridgestone Corporation , is credited with their innovation . Though slowly being replaced by steel-toed rigid-sole construction shoes in some industries , many workers prefer them for the softness of their soles . This gives wearers tactile contact with the ground and lets them use their feet more agilely than rigid-soled shoes allow : for instance , people who traverse girders on construction sites like to know what is under their feet , and craft practitioners such as carpenters and gardeners additionally use their feet as if they were an extra pair of hands , for example to hold objects in place . Nowadays , tabi socksâ '' socks with a separation between the big toe and its neighbor to allow wear with thonged footwearâ '' are also available . This reflects the number of people who still prefer to wear zori and geta , especially during Japan 's hot , humid summers . A related item are toe socks , which have five separate compartments ; these are called ( five-toe socks ) .
ChÃ cents teau-Thierry is a commune in northern France about 56 m east-northeast of Paris . It is a sub-prefecture of the Aisne department in Picardy . In the late years of the western Roman empire , a small town called Otmus was settled on a site where the Soissons-Troyes road crossed the Marne river . During the 8th century , Charles Martel kept king Theuderic IV prisoner in the castle of Otmus . At this time , the town took the name of Castrum Theodorici , later transformed in ChÃ cents teau-Thierry ( Castle of Thierry , Thierry is the French or early Roman language translation of Theuderic ) . In 946 , the castle of ChÃ cents teau-Thierry was the home of Herbert le-Vieux , Count of Omois ( Fr : comte d'Omois ) of the House of Vermandois & Soissons . ChÃ cents teau-Thierry was the site of two important battles . The Battle of ChÃ cents teau-Thierry ( 1814 ) in the Napoleonic Wars between France and Prussia , and Battle of ChÃ cents teau-Thierry ( 1918 ) in World War I , between the United States and Germany . In 1918 , a mounting for the infamous Paris Gun was found near the castle . The cannon itself was never found . ChÃ cents teau-Thierry is situated on the Marne River . ChÃ cents teau-Thierry is the terminus station of a regional railway line starting from the Gare de l'Est in Paris . It is also one of the exits of the A4 motorway that links Paris with the east part of France . Transval operates the local bus routes . ChÃ cents teau-Thierry was the birthplace of Jean de La Fontaine . Teddy Roosevelt 's son Quentin was shot down in July 1918 while flying a French SPAD plane during WWI .

Snog Marry Avoid ? is a British reality TV show on BBC Three hosted by Jenny Frost and produced by Endemol . It focuses mainly on transforming ` fakery obsessed ' or ` slap addicts ' in Britain into natural beauties by stripping them of their skimpy clothes and layers of make-up and giving them a make-under instead of a make-over with the help of POD - the Personal Overhaul Device . Snog Marry Avoid ? has given ` make-unders ' to a range of people from Great Britain including celebrities . Within the world of the program , POD is a computer that `` only understands natural beauty '' . It conducts a public analysis to ask the public whether they would snog , marry or avoid the participant , as well as another random question which offers those questioned another chance to praise or criticise . After the questions it allows the person to choose their style based on a celebrity and dresses them accordingly . It sometimes orders the person to do a ` deep cleanse ' where they have to take off all of their make-up . After the transformation POD will ask the public what they think of the person . The person is then re-introduced to their partner or relative outside the TV studio and their reaction is recorded , generally a positive one towards the more natural look . Later on in the show Jenny Frost will meet with the person to see if they have kept their look and discuss the transformation . As with many BBC TV programs , previews are uploaded to Youtube before the program is screened on TV . The most viewed Snog Marry Avoid ? video on youtube is Scotland 's No1 Male Barbie which got interest around the world due to celebrity blogger Perez Hilton featuring it on his Twitter page . The first series aired from 23 June - 28 July 2008 . It contained six episodes . The second series began on 16 February 2009 . This series also featured celebrities . In the middle of the show Jenny Frost gave beauty tips called ` Frost 's Fixes ' . It contained 12 episodes and ended 11 May 2009 . The celebrities included : To promote the third series BBC3 aired a one off spin-off show called Snog , Marry , Avoid - Top 10 Shockers , a count down of the most memorable make-unders on the December 15 , 2009 . Series three kicked off on 4 February 2010 , with an estimated 12-episode series . Series 4 began on 11 January 2011 at 8PM , airing 2 new episodes on BBC3 . The show has received positive reviews , complimenting its useful beauty tips and ` cliche ' gimmick . BBC Three 's boss has declared it a ` Roaring success ' . Viewership had climbed throughout the two series ' , on average over 750,000 people tuning into each of the second series ' new episodes . Repeats also gain good ratings , becoming one of BBC Three 's top shows . A German version started airing in November 2008 on the commercial channel ProSieben . `` Love Date or Hate â `` die ehrlichste Starstyle-Rubrik der Welt '' ( Love Date or Hate - the most honest starstyle-column in the world ) was a part of the weekly showbiz-oriented television program `` red ! - Stars , Lifestyle & More '' , but due to harsh criticism the column was taken off the show after a few months . POD was called Stylomat in this format ( portmanteau of the words style and automat ) .
Nitrogen triiodide is the inorganic compound with the formula NI3 . It is an extremely sensitive contact explosive : small quantities explode with a gunpowder-like snap when touched even lightly , releasing a purple cloud of iodine vapor . NI3 has a complex structural chemistry that is difficult to study because of the instability of the derivatives . Nitrogen triiodide was first characterized by X-ray crystallography in 1990 when it was prepared by an ammonia-free route . Boron nitride reacts with iodine fluoride in trichlorofluoromethane at â 30 Â C to produce pure NI3 in low yield : NI3 is pyramidal ( C3v molecular symmetry ) , as are the other nitrogen trihalides as well as ammonia . The material that is usually called `` nitrogen triiodide '' is prepared by the reaction of iodine with ammonia . When this reaction is conducted at low temperatures in anhydrous ammonia , the initial product is NI3 Â ( NH3 ) 5 , but this material loses some ammonia upon warming to give the 1:1 adduct NI3 Â ( NH3 ) . This adduct was first reported by Bernard Courtois in 1812 , and its formula was finally determined in 1905 by Silberrad . Its solid state structure consists of chains of - NI2-I-NI2-I-NI2-I - ... Ammonia molecules are situated between the chains . When kept cold in the dark and damp with ammonia , NI3 Â ( NH3 ) is stable . The instability of NI3 and NI3NH3 can be attributed to the great stability of N2 . Nitrogen triiodide has no practical commercial value due to its extreme shock sensitivity , making it impossible to store , transport , and utilize for controlled explosions . Whereas pure nitroglycerin is also highly shock-sensitive ( although not nearly as much so as nitrogen triiodide , which can be set off with the touch of a feather ) and powerful , it was only due to phlegmatizers that its shock sensitivity was reduced and it became safer to handle and transport as dynamite . Consistent with this equation , these explosions leave orange-to-purple stains of iodine , which can be removed with sodium thiosulfate solution . An alternate method of stain removal is to simply allow the iodine time to sublimate . Small amounts of nitrogen triiodide are sometimes synthesized as a demonstration to high school chemistry students or as an act of `` chemical magic '' . To highlight the sensitivity of the compound , it is usually detonated by touching it with a feather but even the slightest air current or other movement can cause detonation . Nitrogen triiodide is also notable for being the only known chemical explosive that detonates when exposed to alpha particles and nuclear fission products .

An ocean current is a continuous , directed movement of ocean water generated by the forces acting upon this mean flow , such as breaking waves , wind , Coriolis force , temperature and salinity differences and tides caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun . Depth contors , shoreline configurations and interaction with other currents influence a current 's direction and strength . Ocean currents can flow for great distances , and together they create the great flow of the global conveyor belt which plays a dominant part in determining the climate of many of the Earthâ s regions . Perhaps the most striking example is the Gulf Stream , which makes northwest Europe much more temperate than any other region at the same latitude . Another example is the Hawaiian Islands , where the climate is cooler ( sub-tropical ) than the tropical latitudes in which they are located , due to the effect of the California Current . Surface ocean currents are generally wind driven and develop their typical clockwise spirals in the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise rotation in the southern hemisphere because of the imposed wind stresses . In wind driven currents , the Ekman spiral effect results in the currents flowing at an angle to the driving winds . The areas of surface ocean currents move somewhat with the seasons ; this is most notable in equatorial currents . Ocean basins generally have a non-symmetric surface current , in that the eastern equatorward-flowing branch is broad and diffuse whereas the western poleward-flowing branch is very narrow . These western boundary currents ( of which the gulf stream is an example ) are a consequence of basic fluid dynamics . Deep ocean currents are driven by density and temperature gradients . Thermohaline circulation , also known as the ocean 's conveyor belt , refers to the deep ocean density-driven ocean basin currents . These currents , which flow under the surface of the ocean and are thus hidden from immediate detection , are called submarine rivers . These are currently being researched using a fleet of underwater robots called Argo . Upwelling and downwelling areas in the oceans are areas where significant vertical movement of ocean water is observed . Surface currents make up about 10 % of all the water in the ocean . Surface currents are generally restricted to the upper 400 m of the ocean . The movement of deep water in the ocean basins is by density driven forces and gravity . The density difference is a function of different temperatures and salinity . Deep waters sink into the deep ocean basins at high latitudes where the temperatures are cold enough to cause the density to increase . Ocean currents are measured in Sverdrup ( Sv ) , where 1Sv is equivalent to a volume flow rate of 1000000 m per second . Knowledge of surface ocean currents is essential in reducing costs of shipping , since they reduce fuel costs . In the sail-ship era knowledge was even more essential . A good example of this is the Agulhas current , which long prevented Portuguese sailors from reaching India . Even today , the round-the-world sailing competitors employ surface currents to their benefit . Ocean currents are also very important in the dispersal of many life forms . An example is the life-cycle of the European Eel . Ocean currents are important in the study of marine debris , and vice versa . These currents also affect temperatures throughout the world . For example , the current that brings warm water up the north Atlantic to northwest Europe stops ice from forming by the shores , which would block ships from entering and exiting ports .

An original printing press for the Penny Black , the D cylinder press invented by Jacob Perkins and patented in 1819 , is on display at the British Library in London . The Penny Black is not a rare stamp . The total print run was 286,700 sheets with 68,808,000 stamps and a substantial number of these have survived , largely because envelopes were not normally used : letters in the form of letter sheets were folded and sealed , with the stamp and the address on the obverse . If the letter was kept , the stamp survived . However , the only known complete sheets of the Penny Black are owned by the British Postal Museum . The Penny Black is readily available on the collectors ' market ; a used stamp in poor condition can cost as little as Â # 10 ( $ 20 ) ; in 2000 , a used stamp in fine condition cost about Â # 110 , an unused example about Â # 1,600 , with prices steadily rising . By contrast , a used Penny Red was Â # 1.50 . In addition to the general issue of the Penny Black , a similar stamp was produced with the letters V and R in the top corners replacing the stars , intended for official mail . Following the general public 's acceptance of the postage stamps and the ridicule of the Mulready stationery produced at the same time , vast supplies of the letter sheets were given to government departments , such as the tax office , for official use and the idea of introducing an official stamp was abandoned . Only a few postally used examples exist , which probably originated from the Post Office circulars sent out as advance notice that the new stamps would be brought into use . Four are known on covers ; all were cut from their envelopes and then replaced . Most of the canceled examples are from trials which were made of cancellation types , inks , and experiments with their removal . These trials led to the change from black to red stamps , and vice versa for the cancellations . The VR official is stated to have been made from the original master die . However , this can not be the case as this die still exists with the original stars intact , in The British Postal Museum & Archive in London . It is believed that the master for this stamp was produced from the transfer roller used for the production of plate 1 with the stars removed from the top corners , as some impressions show traces of these original stars . The Penny Red was a British postage stamp , issued in 1841 . It succeeded the Penny Black and continued as the main type of postage stamp in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until 1879 , with only minor changes to the design during that time . The color was changed from black to red because of difficulty in seeing a cancellation mark on the Penny Black ; a black cancel was readily visible on a Penny Red . Initially , some of the same plates that were used to print the Penny Black were used to print the Penny Red and about 21 billion Penny Reds were printed by Messrs. Perkins , Bacon & Co. .
Puran ( Urdu : Ù 3\/4 Ù Ù Ø Ù ) is a sub-division and tehsil of Shangla District in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan . The subdivision includes three tehsils viz : Puran itself , Martung and Makhuzai . Puran Sub-division comprises nine Union Councils . The subdivision borders Chakesar , Buner , Swat , Kala Dhaka , River Indus . Major towns and villages of the tehsil are Aloch , Nimkalay , Chagam , Sundavi , Sanila , Bengalai . Kotkay , Kolalai , Chowgha and many more . Aloch is the central town and is the tehsil and subdivision headquarters . Puran is a green valley and has fantastic scenic beauty . The name Puran is supposed to be derived from the Hindi word Pooran which means full moon . Residents of Puran believe that the name is probably because of the great natural beauty of the valley . Puran Tehsil has a population of more than 90000 people . Literacy rate in Puran is about 10 % for male and 5 % for female . People mainly live on farming and grow three major crops namely wheat , maize and rice . Fruits and vegetables are also grown but not on commercial scale . Agriculture in Puran depends on rains and no proper irrigation system exists in the valley . However , the valley gets enough precipitation and the crops are seldom effected due to no or less rains . Rice fields are irrigated from natural springs and rivers . Puran is rich in small rivers and natural springs and underground water is a few meters from the earth surface in Aloch . Most of the people in Puran belong to the sub-sect Babozai of the major tribe Yousafzai . People of Puran are famous for their moral values and hospitality . Puran has been home to many politicians of the national level . Ex - Provincial minister Pir Muhammad Khan and Ex-Federal Minister , present Member of the National Assembly ( MNA ) of Pakistan and PML ( Q ) President of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa Amir Muqam belong to Puran Shangla .
The Little Grebe ( Tachybaptus ruficollis ) , also known as Dabchick , is 23 to 29 cm in length . It is the smallest European member of the grebe family of water birds and is commonly found in open bodies of water across most of its range . The Little Grebe is a small water bird with a pointed bill . The adult is unmistakable in summer , predominantly dark above with its rich , rufous color neck , cheeks and flanks , and bright yellow gape . The rufous is replaced by a dirty brownish gray in non-breeding and juvenile birds . Juvenile birds have a yellow bill with a small black tip , and black and white streaks on the cheeks and sides of the neck as seen below . This yellow bill darkens as the juveniles age , eventually turning black once in adulthood In winter , its size , buff plumage , with a darker back and cap , and â powder puffâ rear end enable easy identification of this species . The Little Grebe 's breeding call , given singly or in duet , is a trilled repeated weet-weet-weet or wee-wee-wee which sounds like a horse whinnying . There are nine currently-recognized subspecies of Little Grebe , separated principally by size and colouration . This bird breeds in small colonies in heavily vegetated areas of freshwater lakes across Europe , much of Asia down to New Guinea , and most of Africa . Most birds move to more open or coastal waters in winter , but it is only migratory in those parts of its range where the waters freeze . Outside of breeding season , it moves into more open water , occasionally even appearing on the coast in small bays . The Little Grebe is an excellent swimmer and diver and pursues its fish and aquatic invertebrate prey underwater . It uses the vegetation skilfully as a hiding place . Like all grebes , it nests at the water 's edge , since its legs are set very far back and it can not walk well . Usually four to seven eggs are laid . When the adult bird leaves the nest it usually takes care to cover the eggs with weeds . The young leave the nest and can swim soon after hatching , and chicks are often carried on the backs of the swimming adults .
Pedagogy ( or ) is the study of being a teacher or the process of teaching . The term generally refers to strategies of instruction , or a style of instruction . Pedagogy is also occasionally referred to as the correct use of instructive strategies ( see instructional theory ) . For example , Paulo Freire referred to his method of teaching adult humans as `` critical pedagogy '' . In correlation with those instructive strategies the instructor 's own philosophical beliefs of instruction are harbored and governed by the pupil 's background knowledge and experience , situation , and environment , as well as learning goals set by the student and teacher . One example would be the Socratic schools of thought . The word comes from the Greek ( paidagÅ geÅ ) ; in which means `` child '' and ( Ã gÅ ) means `` lead '' ; so it literally means `` to lead the child '' . In Ancient Greece , was ( usually ) a slave who supervised the instruction of his masterâ s son ( girls were not publicly taught ) . This involved taking him to school or a gym , looking after him and carrying his equipment ( e.g. music instruments ) . The Latin-derived word for pedagogy : child-instruction , is in modern use in English to refer to the whole context of instruction , learning , and the actual operation involved therein , although both words have roughly the same original meaning . In English the term pedagogy is used to refer to instructive theory ; trainee teachers learn their subject and also the pedagogy appropriate for teaching that subject . The introduction of information technology into schools has necessitated changes in pedagogy ; teachers are adopting new methods of teaching facilitated by the new technology . The late Malcolm Knowles reasoned that the term andragogy is more pertinent when discussing adult learning and teaching . He referred to andragogy as the art and science of teaching adults . An academic degree , Ped . D. , Doctor of Pedagogy , is awarded honorarily by some U.S. universities to distinguished teachers ( in the U.S. and U.K. earned degrees within the instructive field are classified as an Ed . D. , Doctor of Education or a Ph. D. . Doctor of Philosophy ) . The term is also used to denote an emphasis in education as a specialty in a field ( for instance , a Doctor of Music degree in piano pedagogy ) .
The Causeway is a narrow strip of reclaimed land and bridges in the north of Bermuda linking Hamilton Parish on the mainland in the southwest and Bermuda International Airport on St. David 's Island in St. George 's Parish in the northeast , which are otherwise divided by Castle Harbour . The need for such a roadway was long-known to Bermuda 's authorities . In the early 19th century , a committee was established to investigate possible plans . It would not be until 1867 that a valid plan , that by Lt. Albert Hime of the Royal Engineers , was approved . Hime 's Causeway was opened to traffic on 19 September 1871 by Governor Lefroy . The construction project cost Â # 27,000 ( in comparison , the local government raised only Â # 25,000 in revenue for that year ) . Originally , it spanned from Blue Hole Hill , across the Cartwheel Islands ( four small islets that are no longer visible ) to Longbird Island . The project also included a new road in Bailey 's Bay and across Longbird Island , and a swing bridge from Longbird to St. George 's , finally giving an uninterrupted land route from the burgeoning main island to the old colony . Until World War II , there were virtually no motor vehicles allowed in Bermuda , and only bicycles and horse-drawn carriages used the Causeway . The Bermuda Railway operated island-wide , providing rail passenger and freight service between St. George 's and Somerset in Sandys Parish , Bermuda . Consequently , the causeway was lightly used . With the construction of the Kindley Field airbase by the U.S. Army Air Force in 1942 -- 1943 and the relaxation of the ban on motor vehicles for essential military uses during the wartime emergency , motorized vehicle use of the causeway increased significantly . In the late 1940s , the Bermuda Government allowed civilian use of motor vehicles and the causeway became an essential part of Bermuda 's transport infrastructure for the average citizen . Throughout its existence , the causeway has suffered from damage due to hurricanes . On 1 September 1880 , the causeway was wrecked by `` the great storm '' . It was rebuilt following the original design , which stood until 14 September 1899 , when three-fourth of a mile of the bridge was ravaged by another powerful hurricane . Afterwards , the causeway was rebuilt of stone block . Nearly a century later , in 1995 , Hurricane Felix caused notable damage . Shortly after that , on 5 September 2003 , Hurricane Fabian dealt critical damage , including the loss of four lives . Following the damage inflicted by Hurricane Fabian , the Bermuda Government began investigating alternatives to simply repairing the Causeway after each storm knocked it out . These alternatives include an underwater tunnel , a true bridge and constructing additional roadways , such as through Coney Island and Ferry Reach parks . Public meetings on these plans began in October , 2006 . By February 2010 , however , plans to replace to Causeway had been abandoned , and the issue was a touchy subject when raised in Senate of Bermuda .

Protostomia ( from Greek meaning `` mouth first '' ) are a clade of animals . Together with the deuterostomes and a few smaller phyla , they make up the Bilateria , mostly comprising animals with bilateral symmetry and three germ layers . The major distinctions between deuterostomes and protostomes are found in embryonic development . In animals at least as complex as earthworms , the embryo forms a dent on one side , the blastopore , which deepens to become the archenteron , the first phase in the growth of the gut . In deuterostomes , the original dent becomes the anus while the gut eventually tunnels through to make another opening , which forms the mouth . The protostomes were so named because it used to be thought that in their embryos the dent formed the mouth while the anus was formed later , at the opening made by the other end of the gut . More recent research , however , shows that in protostomes the edges of the dent close up in the middle , leaving openings at the ends which become the mouth and anus . However , this idea has been challenged , because the platyhelminthes , a group which forms a sister group to the rest of the bilaterian animals , have a single mouth which leads into a blind gut ( with no anus ) . The genes employed in the embryonic construction of this mouth are the same as those expressed around the protostome mouth , as well as a number of minor taxa of basal or ambiguous affinity .

Xabier ` Xabi ' Prieto Argarate ( born 29 August 1983 in San SebastiÃ n , Basque Country ) is a Spanish footballer who plays for Real Sociedad in La Liga , mainly as a right midfielder . A player of good dribbling skills , he is also a penalty kick specialist . Prieto made his debut with hometown Real Sociedad 's on October 8 , 2003 , in a 1 â `` 0 home win over Navarrese neighbors CA Osasuna , going on to collect a further eight - seven of them late in the game - substitute appearances . However , as the league 's outcome was already decided , he profitted from his second start to net twice at Real Madrid , one of them from the spot , in a 4 â `` 1 success , on May 23 , 2004 . Subsequently , Prieto was definitely promoted to the first squad and , in 2005 â `` 06 , participated in all 38 La Liga matches , scoring nine times , six of them being penalties . In the following season he was also everpresent , but the Basque dropped down a level . Prieto played in 35 games in 2009 â `` 10 , totalling exactly 3000 minutes and contributing with seven goals , as Real Sociedad returned to the first division after three years . In the first game of the following season , at home against Villarreal CF , he scored the game 's only goal , after a backheel pass from newly-signed Joseba Llorente .

Takeo Gerard Spikes ( tÉ Ë kiË oÊ ; born December 17 , 1976 in Sandersville , Georgia ) is an American football linebacker for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League . He was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals 13th overall in the 1998 NFL Draft . He played college football at Auburn . A two-time Pro Bowl selection , Spikes has also played for the Buffalo Bills and Philadelphia Eagles . In high school at Washington County High School in Sandersville , Georgia he earned All-American honors from Parade and USA Today and was named Georgia 's `` Mr. Football '' by state coaches as a senior . Spikes was also named Georgia Player of the Year as a senior . Takeo entered Auburn , majoring in liberal arts . In the 1997 campaign , he led Auburn with 136 tackles as Auburn advanced to the SEC Championship . Spikes was college teammates with productive tailback Stephen Davis . Spikes entered the 1998 NFL Draft and was drafted in the first round by the Cincinnati Bengals . In his rookie season he started all the preseason games and all the regular season games . He became the first rookie to lead the Bengals in tackles since James Francis led them in 1990 . He also led the team by total snaps played on offense and defense , which added up to 997 . In 1999 he was the team captain , playing in all his games as a Right Inside Linebacker and a Right Linebacker . He forced four fumbles and recovered four , leading the team in that as well . In 2000 he played every game as a Right Linebacker and recorded 128 tackles . He passed the 100 tackle mark for the third straight time and led the team in tackles and fumble recoveries . 2001 Spikes started at RLB for all of the 15 games he played that season . He once again led the team in solo and total tackles in the 2001 campaign . Spikes missed Game 5 because of his father 's ( Jimmie ) death . 2002 was his final season with the Bengals , as he played all 16 games . In his tenure with the Bengals , he played 79 of a possible 80 games , missing one for his father 's funeral . He led the team in solo and total tackles once again and scored his second defensive TD by way of fumble recovery . 2003 was the first season Spikes played with the Bills , earning his first Pro Bowl appearance and started all 16 games once more . He recorded 126 tackles , with the addition of a pair of sacks , a pair of interceptions , and a pair of fumble recoveries . On September 25 , 2005 , Spikes suffered a season-ending tear to his right Achilles ' tendon while tackling Michael Vick during the Bills 24-16 loss to the Atlanta Falcons in Week 3 . In 2006 , while recovering from a torn Achilles tendon , Spikes played in 12 games while missing 4 games early in the season due to a hamstring injury . During the first series of the first game of the year , Spikes made a blind side sack on Patriots QB Tom Brady , forcing a fumble which was recovered by Bills LB London Fletcher for a touchdown . The sack and forced fumble were Spikes ' only of the season . Spikes , not wanting to be part of a Bills youth movement , asked for a trade to a contender . On March 26 , 2007 , he was traded as part of a multi-player deal to the Philadelphia Eagles . The deal sent Spikes and Kelly Holcomb to the Eagles for Darwin Walker and a 2008 draft pick . After an effective first season as an Eagle , Spikes season was cut short in week 14 when he suffered a torn rotator cuff injury against the Dallas Cowboys , a game the Eagles won 10-6 . He was released by the Eagles on March 6 , 2008 . On August 10 , 2008 , Spikes was signed by the San Francisco 49ers on the same day they released linebacker Brandon Moore .

Miki 's successor , who was appointed the nation 's 67th Prime Minister on December 24 , 1976 a week after Takeo was born , was also Takeo ( Fukuda ) . Takeo 's younger cousin Brandon Spikes plays football for the New England Patriots .
V2 Records ( or V2 Music ) is a record label that is owned by Universal Music Group as of October 2007 . The label was founded in 1996 by Richard Branson , five years after he sold Virgin Records to EMI . Ultimately , the label was owned 95 % by Morgan Stanley and 5 % by Branson because Morgan Stanley was the chief financier of the company . Over the years V2 acquired Gee Street Records , Junior Boy 's Own , Blue Dog Records , and Big Cat Records . The label also distributed many labels , such as Wichita , Luaka Bop , City Slang , and Modular . V2 now operates in Australia , Belgium , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Greece , Netherlands , Spain , Ireland , Sweden , United Kingdom , and United States . It was distributed in the US by BMG ; however it left for WEA shortly after the formation of Sony BMG . Its headquarters were located at 14 East 4th Street in Manhattan , the former US home of Island Records , which was in the same building as the former Greenwich Village branch of Tower Records . In April 2005 , Cooperative Music was set up as by the V2 Music Group as a transnational marketing and distribution operation which licenses independent labels , as opposed to individual artist companies which is the standard industry practice , for release in Europe , Australia and Japan . This in-house licensing division has an exclusive international marketing team with representation in the UK , Ireland , France , Germany , Italy , Spain , Holland , Belgium , Sweden , Norway , Denmark , Australia and Japan . In 2006 Branson sold V2 Records North America to Sheridan Square Entertainment for $ 15 million . They then merged V2 North America with its label Artemis Records . The new label was effectively divested from the Virgin Group . In May 2006 , much of V2 's catalogue , including multiplatinum artists Moby and The White Stripes , was added to eMusic , making the label one of the most high-profile featured on the online music site , which mostly sells DRM-free independent music at a cost considerably lower than many of its competitors . On 12 January 2007 , V2 's United States and Canada branches announced that they were undergoing restructuring to focus on its back catalogue and digital distribution . As a result , their employees were let go and their roster of artists left as free agents . In August 2007 , the company was sold for Â # 7 million to Universal Music Group . Subsequently in October 2007 , UMG partnered the US operations of its independent distribution arm Fontana Distribution , known as Fontana International , with London-based Cooperative Music of V2 Music . The intent was to enhance expansion through international agreements , and so independent labels from Europe under Cooperative Music would gain access to the independent American marketplace through Fontana International 's diverse connections in independent marketing , promotion and distribution support . Cooperative Music is now an established label group headed up by Vincent Clery-Melin , with both UK and International marketing teams . Cooperative Music UK has had significant success with various acts such as Fleet Foxes , Phoenix and The Black Keys , headed up by Head Of Marketing Jason Rackham with support of Product Managers Craig Penney , Ed Pearson and Johnny Brocklehurst . After Sheridan Square 's liquidation , V2 Records North America was sold to IndieBlu Music Holdings . IndieBlu was acquired by E1 Entertainment in 2010 ; now , V2 Records North America is presently owned and distributed by E1 , and is no longer affiliated with its former parent label .
Sexual conflict occurs when the two sexes have conflicting optimal fitness strategies concerning reproduction , leading to an evolutionary arms race between males and females . It has primarily been studied in animals , though it can in principle apply to any sexually reproducing organism , such as plants and fungi . Sexual conflict may lead to antagonistic co-evolution , in which one sex ( usually males ) evolves a favorable trait which is countered by a countering trait in the other sex . For example , male bean weevils ( Callosobruchus maculatus ) have spiny genitalia that are thought to allow them to copulate for a longer time without getting dislodged and hence transfer more sperm . However , this damages the female and reduces her fitness , so females have evolved the counteradaptation of kicking at males during mating , which reduces the time spent in copulation . Some regard sexual conflict as a subset of sexual selection ( which was traditionally regarded as mutualistic ) , while others suggest it is a separate evolutionary phenomenon . There are a wide variety of manifestations of sexual conflict , occurring in a broad range of taxa , and showing extreme examples such as the well-known phenomenon of sexual cannibalism among insects , usually demonstrated by the female . One way of sorting these manifestations is by temporal relation to a given reference point , e.g. mating , fertilization , or birth . During pregnancy , there is a two-way traffic of immunologically active cell lines through the placenta . Fetal lymphocyte lines may survive in women even decades after giving birth . These cells may serve the adaptive interest of the mother , however , they may also serve conflicting interests of the fetus or those of the father . This mixture of shared or contradicting interests have been hypothesized to give rise to diseases like autoimmune diseases , infertility , and habitual spontaneous abortion ( i.e. , early miscarriage ) in humans .
A vole is a small rodent resembling a mouse but with a stouter body , a shorter hairy tail , a slightly rounder head , smaller ears and eyes , and differently formed molars ( high-crowned and with angular cusps instead of low-crowned and with rounded cusps ) . There are approximately 155 species of voles . They are sometimes known as meadow mice or field mice in North America . Vole species form the subfamily Arvicolinae with the lemmings and the muskrats . Voles are small rodents that grow to 3-7 inches , depending on the species . They can have 5 â `` 10 litters per year . Gestation lasts for 3 weeks and the young voles reach sexual maturity in a month . As a result of this exponential growth , vole populations can grow very large within a very short period of time . Since litters average 5 â `` 10 young , a single pregnant vole in a yard can result in a hundred or more active voles in less than a year . Voles are commonly mistaken for other small animals . Moles , gophers , mice , rats and even shrews have similar characteristics and behavioral tendencies . Since voles will commonly use burrows with many exit holes , they can be mistaken for gophers or some kind of ground squirrel . Voles can create and will oftentimes utilize old abandoned mole tunnels thus confusing the land owner into thinking that moles are active . When voles find their way into the home , they are readily misidentified as mice or young rats . In fact , voles are unique and best described as being a little bit like all the other animals they are so commonly thought to be . They will readily thrive on small plants . Like shrews they will eat dead animals and like mice or rats , they can live on most any nut or fruit . Additionally , voles will target plants more than most other small animals . It is here where their presence is mostly evident . Voles will readily girdle small trees and ground cover much like a porcupine . This girdling can easily kill young plants and is not healthy for trees or other shrubs . Voles will often eat succulent root systems and will burrow under plants or ground cover they are particularly fond of and eat away until the plant is dead . Bulbs in the ground are another favorite target for voles ; their excellent burrowing and tunnelling gives them access to sensitive areas without clear or early warning . A vole infestation is often only identifiable after they have destroyed a number of plants . Many predators such as martens , raccoons , owls , hawks , falcons , coyotes , foxes , snakes , the red tailed hawk , weasels , cats and dogs eat voles . A common predator of voles is the short-eared owl as well as the northern spotted owl , the Saw-whet Owl , the barn Owl , the Great Gray Owl and the Northern Pygmy Owl . The average life of the smaller vole species is 3 -- 6 months . These voles rarely live longer than 12 months . Larger species , such as the european water vole , live longer and usually die during their second , or rarely their third , winter . The prairie vole is a notable animal model for its monogamous sexual fidelity , since the male is usually faithful to the female , and shares in the raising of pups . ( The woodland vole is also usually monogamous . ) Another species from the same genus , the meadow vole , has promiscuously mating males , and scientists have changed adult male meadow voles ' behavior to resemble that of prairie voles in experiments in which a single gene was introduced into the brain via a virus . The behavior is influenced by the number of repetitions of a particular string of microsatellite ( `` junk '' ) DNA , and the same DNA sequence is found in humans . Male prairie voles with the longest DNA strings spend more time with their mates and pups than male prairie voles with shorter strings . However , other workers have disputed the gene 's relationship to monogamy , and cast doubt on whether the human version plays an analogous role . Physiologically , pair-bonding behavior has been shown to be tied up with vasopressin , dopamine , and oxytocin , with the genetic influence apparently arising via the number receptors for these substances in the brain ; the pair-bonding behavior has also been shown in experiments to be strongly modifiable by administering some of these substances directly . Voles exhibit complex genetic structures with much variation , and appear to be evolving rapidly when compared with other vertebrates . For this reason , they can be useful to archaeologists for dating strata , in a method referred to as the `` vole clock . '' Voles have a number of unusual chromosomal traits . Species have been found with anywhere from 17 â `` 64 chromosomes , and in some species males and females have different chromosome numbers . Female voles have been found with chromosomes from both sexes , and in one species the sex chromosomes contain 20 % of the genome . All of these variations result in very little physical aberration : most vole species are virtually indistinguishable .

Sweet Children is the third EP by the American punk rock band Green Day . It was released in the Summer of 1990 through Skene ! Records . The name of the EP is a reference to the original name of Green Day . The EP is a collection of some of the band 's earliest songs that they were still playing live at the time . It was recorded in 1990 , in Minneapolis , Minnesota while the band were on a brief break from their summer tour , and released on seven-inch vinyl . Due to a typo on Green Day 's website , many believe that this record was released in 1987 , but this is not true . What makes it believable is the rough sound and poor mixing of the recordings . The EP was released on Minneapolis-based indie label Skene ! Records . These were the last recordings drummer John Kiffmeyer would appear on . Shortly after the end of the tour , he left the band to attend college . Also of note , `` My Generation '' features a line from the film Blue Velvet : `` Heineken ? Fuck that shit ! '' , said by the primary antagonist Frank Booth ( although it 's not the actual audio sample ) . A song that was played around the time period , but not put on the EP was their cover of `` Johnny B. Goode '' , which was performed at later concerts as well . There are five different pressings of the EP ( some limited quantities included two different variations of red vinyl ) . The first four have out of print since its inclusion on the CD issue of Green Day 's second album Kerplunk ! in 1992 . Because of this , it has since become a valuable and sought-after item among collectors and Green Day fans alike . The first pressing 's cover is a picture of Mike Dirnt 's leg during a concert . The second pressing 's cover is a black and white picture of a somewhat trashed Volkswagen Beetle with the caption `` What Do You Think Mike ... '' This rare second pressing , limited to 600 copies as opposed to the first run 's respectable 1,500 , also featured a handwritten insert , reading `` Not a lyrics sheet , so do n't get your hopes up '' . The third pressing is the same as the one above in every way except there is no insert , and the cover , instead of being black and white , is tinted red . The fourth pressing is obviously a reissue from possibly 1991 , for it features a mostly blank cover with a picture of the band , and a rather long summary on the back of the sleeve , which explains how these songs are also on Kerplunk , so this must be a reissue of the EP . On March 24 , 2009 , the EP was back in print as it was included with the vinyl reissue of Kerplunk ! . It is a reissue of the first pressing . In 1990 , on the first day of the EP 's release , it sold 493 copies . One of the most mysterious aspects of this odd EP is its release date . Although the inlay on some says it was from 1990 , this information may be faulty , like other early Green Day inlays . Another reason why the release date could be 1990 is that the first album was made by Green Day , not Sweet Children ; a name they were thought to have dropped before the release of 1,000 Hours in 1989 . For a while , the official Green Day website claimed it was released in 1987 ( the current Green Day website no longer covers EPs ) . Also , a 1989 performance of My Generation is different from the album version , and a later 1992 performance matches the album . Finally , Allmusic claims it was released in 1988 , however , there are no facts to support this .

A polar circle is either the Arctic Circle or the Antarctic Circle . On Earth , ( Epoch 2011 ) the Arctic Circle is located at a latitude of N , and the Antarctic Circle is located at a latitude of S. Areas between each polar circle and its associated pole ( North Pole or South Pole ) , known geographically as the frigid zones , would theoretically experience at least one 24 hour period when the sun is continuously above the horizon and at least one 24 hour period when the sun is continuously below the horizon annually . However , atmospheric refraction extends the continuous daylight area while shrinking the continuous darkness area somewhat . The exact location of the polar circles differs annually as the rotation axis of the earth shifts due to nutation and precession . Therefore the latitudes noted above are an average of those yearly changes .
Sakic 's handing of the trophy to Bourque is seen as just another example of Sakic 's leadership abilities and how he performs through actions rather than words . Ronald Michael Francis , Jr. ( born March 1 , 1963 ) is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey center who played 23 seasons in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) for the Hartford Whalers , Pittsburgh Penguins , Carolina Hurricanes and Toronto Maple Leafs . He now serves as the associate head coach and director of player personnel for the Hurricanes . Francis was drafted by the Hartford Whalers in round 1 ( fourth overall ) of the 1981 NHL Entry Draft . He was a model of consistency and durability , averaging more than a point a game in over 1700 games in 23 seasons , and ( not counting the lockout-shortened 1994 â `` 95 season ) averaging just under 77 games played a season . His three Lady Byng Trophies attest to his gentlemanly conduct on and off the ice . Francis stands second all-time in career assists behind Wayne Gretzky with 1,249 , fourth in career points ( 1,798 ) , third in games played ( 1,731 ) , and twenty-first in career goals ( 549 ) . Francis played almost ten seasons with the Whalers , serving as captain for almost six and setting nearly every offensive record in franchise history . He was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins on March 4 , 1991 with Ulf Samuelsson and Grant Jennings , in exchange for Jeff Parker , Zarley Zalapski , and John Cullen . The trade became a coup for Pittsburgh , where he centred a formidable second line behind Mario Lemieux , as the Penguins won their first Stanley Cup â `` on a goal by Samuelsson â `` less than three months later . Francis was indispensable the following year , as Pittsburgh repeated as champions , in leading the team during the absence of Lemieux in the 1992 playoffs â `` and in scoring the Cup-clinching goal against the Chicago Blackhawks . At the same time , it is considered to be one of the most one-sided trades in NHL history ( though The Hockey News suggested that Hartford had gotten the better end of the trade at the time ) , ; the players Hartford acquired never approached the numbers or impact Francis produced there or with Pittsburgh . Francis would spend seven seasons in Pittsburgh , captaining the team twice , and becoming the first Penguin to win the Selke Trophy in 1995 . Francis returned to his original organization as a free agent for 1998 â `` 99 , signing with the Carolina Hurricanes ( who had moved from Hartford the previous season ) . He spent the next 5.5 seasons padding his franchise records . He still ranks first all-time in Whalers\/Hurricanes history in points , goals , assists and games played ; his 1,175 points with the franchise are double that of the runner-up , Kevin Dineen . He captained the Hurricanes to a surprise appearance in the 2002 Stanley Cup Finals and scored the winning goal for the Hurricanes in overtime of Game 1 , before losing to the Detroit Red Wings in five games . He is the only player in NHL history to be named to captain two separate franchises ( Hartford\/Carolina and Pittsburgh ) each in two separate periods . Francis finished his career with a brief stint with the Toronto Maple Leafs , traded there by the Hurricanes in March 2004 to allow him one last run at the Stanley Cup . He retired from the NHL before the 2005 â `` 06 season and assumed a position with the Raleigh Youth Hockey Association . He won 2 Stanley Cups , in 1990 â `` 91 and the following season , with the Pittsburgh Penguins . His best season was 1995 â `` 96 when he had 119 points ; that season , he led the league in assists with 92 . The previous season , he had not only led the league in assists with 48 over the strike-shortened half-season schedule , but became the first player to win both the Frank J. Selke Trophy and the Lady Byng Trophy in the same season . His Whalers number # 10 was raised at the Hartford Civic Center on January 6 , 2006 ( though not officially retired , the Whalers organization no longer existing to retire it ) , along with Ulf Samuelsson 's # 5 and Kevin Dineen 's # 11 . Additionally his Hurricanes # 10 jersey was retired by the Carolina organization on January 28 , 2006 . He is also pictured in the Pittsburgh Penguins Ring of Honor that circles the inside of Mellon Arena . On June 28 , 2007 , he was selected to enter the Hockey Hall of Fame in his first year on the ballot . He was formally inducted on November 12 , 2007 .
A symptom ( from Greek Ï Ï Î 1\/4 Ï Ï Ï Î 1\/4 Î , `` accident , misfortune , that which befalls '' , from Ï Ï Î 1\/4 Ï Î Ï Ï Ï , `` I befall '' , from Ï Ï Î 1\/2 - `` together , with '' + Ï Î Ï Ï Ï , `` I fall '' ) is a departure from normal function or feeling which is noticed by a patient , indicating the presence of disease or abnormality . A symptom is subjective , observed by the patient , and not measured . A symptom may not be a malady , for example symptoms of pregnancy . One could debate , however , that this is an example of common misuse of a word , as the majority of symptoms and the history of the word are related to malady . The proper word for such situations would be `` indication '' or `` suggestion '' or simply `` sign '' Symptoms may be chronic , relapsing or remitting . They also may progressively worsen or progressively become better ( convalescence ) . Conditions may also be classified as symptomatic ( present and demonstrating symptoms ) or asymptomatic ( present but without symptoms ) . Asymptomatic conditions and asymptomatic infections can exist for many years undiagnosed and may only be found upon medical testing ( such as high blood pressure ) . Constitutional or general symptoms are those that are related to the systemic effects of a disease ( e.g. , fever , malaise , anorexia , weight loss ) . They affect the entire body rather than a specific organ or location . The terms `` chief complaint '' , `` presenting symptom '' , or `` presenting complaint '' are used to describe the initial concern which brings a patient to a doctor . The symptom that ultimately leads to a diagnosis is called a `` cardinal symptom '' . Non-specific symptoms are those self-reported symptoms that do not indicate a specific disease process or involve an isolated body system . For example , fatigue is a feature of an enormous number of medical conditions , and is a documented feature of both acute and chronic medical conditions , both physical and mental disorders , and as both a primary and secondary symptom . Fatigue is also a normal , healthy condition when experienced after exertion or at the end of a day . In describing mental disorders , especially schizophrenia , symptoms can be divided into positive and negative symptoms . Some symptoms occur in a wide range of disease processes , whereas other symptoms are fairly specific for a narrow range of illnesses . For example , a sudden loss of sight in one eye has a significantly smaller number of possible causes than nausea does . Some symptoms can be misleading to the patient or the medical practitioner caring for them . For example , inflammation of the gallbladder often gives rise to pain in the right shoulder , which may understandably lead the patient to attribute the pain to a non-abdominal cause such as muscle strain . A symptom can more simply be defined as any feature which is noticed by the patient . A sign is noticed by other people . It is not necessarily the nature of the sign or symptom which defines it , but who observes it . A feature might be sign or a symptom , or both , depending on the observer ( s ) . For example , a skin rash may be noticed by either a healthcare professional as a sign , or by the patient as a symptom . When it is noticed by both , then the feature is both a sign and a symptom . Some features , such as pain , can only be symptoms , because they can not be directly observed by other people . Other features can only be signs , such as a blood cell count measured in a medical laboratory .

Woody Bay , within the Exmoor National Park , is a station on the former Lynton and Barnstaple Railway , a narrow gauge line that ran through Exmoor from Barnstaple to Lynton and Lynmouth in North Devon . The station was situated inland , about 2 km from Woody Bay itself . It opened with the line ( as Wooda Bay until the name was changed in 1901 ) on 7 March 1898 , and closed with it after service on 29 September 1935 . From 1923 until closure , the line was operated by the Southern Railway . Woody Bay station was built in part to serve the expected development of a resort at Woody Bay , a mile or so to the north . A pier was built in the bay , although little further development took place , and the pier was destroyed by heavy seas before any trade could be established with passing steamers , and the development was abandoned when the promotor went into liquidation in 1900 , and although a route was surveyed for a branch line to the bay , it was never constructed . Following purchase by the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway Company in 1995 , restoration of the station began , and it opened as a Visitors ' Centre in 2003 . An `` out and back '' service over a few hundred yards of track began in 2004 , and with the opening of a temporary station about a mile towards Parracombe Halt , a regular `` point to point '' service started in 2006 . Several trees have grown in the intervening years , but these two photos , taken over a hundred years apart , are still recognisably from the same location . The carriage shed built into the cutting beyond the station is a temporary structure erected in 2003 .
Sophie Marceau ( ; born 17 November 1966 ) is a French actress , who has appeared in 35 films . During her teens , Marceau achieved popularity with her debut films La Boum ( 1980 ) and La Boum 2 ( 1982 ) , for which she received a CÃ sar Award for Most Promising Actress . In addition to her French-language films , she has worked in international films such as Braveheart ( 1995 ) , and played the main antagonist , Elektra King , in The World Is Not Enough ( 1999 ) . Marceau was born Sophie DaniÃ le Sylvie Maupu in Paris , France , the second child of Simone ( nÃ e Morisset ) , a shop assistant , and BenoÃ t Maupu , a truck driver . The family lived a working-class existence that left Marceau with generally fond memories of childhood . During the week , she helped at the family restaurant . She spent weekends with her family in La Cabane , a small house in Vert-le-Petit in the department Essonne . Her parents divorced when she was nine . In February 1980 , Marceau and her mother came across a model agency looking for teenagers . Marceau had photos taken at the agency but did not think anything would come of it . At the same time , FranÃ oise Menidrey , the casting director for Claude Pinoteau 's La Boum ( 1980 ) , asked modeling agencies to recommend a new teenager for the project . After viewing the rushes , Alain PoirÃ , the director of the Gaumont Film Company , signed Marceau to a long-term contract . La Boum was a hit not only in France , where 4.5 million tickets were sold , but several other European countries and Japan . In 1981 , Marceau made her singing debut with French singer FranÃ ois ValÃ ry on `` Dream in Blue , '' written by DelanoÃ `` . In 1982 , at the age of 15 , Marceau bought back her contract with Gaumont for one million French francs . She borrowed most of the money . After starring in the sequel film La Boum 2 in 1982 , Marceau focused on more dramatic roles , including Fort Saganne ( co-starring GÃ rard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve ) and Joyeuses PÃ cents ques ( Happy Easter ) in 1984 , L'Amour Braque and Police in 1985 , and Descente aux Enfers ( Descent Into Hell ) in 1986 . In 1988 , she starred in L'Etudiante ( The Student ) and Chouans ! . That year , Marceau was named Best Romantic Actress at the International Festival of Romantic Movies for her role in Chouans . In 1989 , she starred in Mes nuits sont plus belles que vos jours ( My Nights are more Beautiful than your Days ) , which was directed by her long-time boyfriend Andrzej Zulawski . In 1990 , she starred in Pacific Palisades and La Note Bleue , her third film directed by her companion . In 1991 , she ventured into the theater in Eurydice , which earned Marceau the Moliere Award for Best Female Newcomer . Marceau began making less-dramatic films , such as the comedy Fanfan in 1993 and La Fille de D'Artagnan in 1994 â '' both popular in Europe and abroad . That year , she returned to the theater as Eliza Dolittle in Pygmalion . Marceau achieved international recognition in 1995 as Princess Isabelle in Mel Gibson 's Braveheart . That year , she was part of an ensemble of international actors in the French film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni and Wim Wenders , Beyond the Clouds . In 1997 , she continued with William Nicholson 's Firelight , filmed in England , VÃ ra Belmont 's Marquise , filmed in France , and Bernard Rose 's Anna Karenina . She played Hippolyta in A Midsummer Night 's Dream ( 1999 ) . She became a villainess Bond girl by playing Elektra King in The World Is Not Enough ( 1999 ) . Marceau teamed up again with her then-boyfriend Andrzej Zulawski to film La FidÃ litÃ in 2000 . In 1995 , Marceau wrote a semi-autobiographical novel , Menteuse ( engl . translation Telling Lies published in 2001 ) , in which the narrator is a beautiful actress who is confident in her beauty and talent and yet insecure . The unnamed narrator takes the reader into a world of memories , fantasies , and impressions , but never reveals herself completely . Marceau 's work was described as `` an exploration of female identity '' . Marceau describes what the narrator is going through : In 2002 , Marceau made her directorial debut in the feature film Speak to Me of Love for which she was named Best Director at the Montreal World Film Festival . The film starred Judith GodrÃ che . It was her second effort at directing ( she made the nine-minute short film L'Aube Ã l'envers in 1995 , which also starred GodrÃ che ) . Marceau had a 17 year relationship with director Andrzej Å '' uÅ awski , who is 26 years her senior . Their son Vincent was born in June 1995 . In 2001 , Marceau separated from Å '' uÅ awski and became involved with producer Jim Lemley and later gave birth to her second child , Juliette , born in Paris in 2002 .
Peach is a color that combines pink and orange colors . This color is named for the pale color of the peach fruit . Like the color apricot , the color called peach is paler than most actual peach fruits and seems to have been formulated ( like the color apricot ) primarily to create a pastel palette of colors for interior design . Peach can also be described as pale orange . At right is displayed the color peach . The shade of peach shown at right approximates the color of the interior flesh of that variety of peaches known as white peaches . The first recorded use of peach as a color name in English was in 1588 . The etymology of the color peach ( and the fruit ) : the word comes from the Middle English peche , derived from Middle French , in turn derived from Latin persica , i.e. , the fruit from Persia . In actuality , the ultimate origin of the peach fruit was from China . Displayed at right is the color peach-yellow . Displayed at right is the web color peach puff . Displayed at right is the color deep peach . This is the color called peach in Crayola crayons ( formerly called flesh before 1962 ) . Displayed at right is the color peach-orange . This shade of peach is the closest to the actual color of the regular ( not white ) varieties of peach fruit , such as the Elberta peach and the yellow cling peach .

The Sagami River is a river in Kanagawa and Yamanashi Prefectures on the island of HonshÅ `` , Japan . The upper reaches of the river in Yamanashi prefecture are also sometimes known as the Katsura River , and the portion near the river mouth as the Banyu River . The river overall was sometimes referred to as the Ayu River from the sweetfish ( ayu ) which were once abundant in its waters . The Sagami River drains Lake Yamanaka , the largest and easternmost of the Fuji Five Lakes in Yamanashi Prefecture . It loops northwest , then northeast through Yamanashi , before following a generally southerly course to exit into Sagami Bay of the Pacific Ocean between the cities of Hiratsuka and Chigasaki . It is dammed at several locations along the way , forming a number of reservoir lakes , the largest of which are Lake Sagami and Lake Tsukui . The river has had to re-cut its course several times due to repeated eruptions of Mount Fuji , and river terraces are in evidence along its upper reaches in Yamanashi . As the river crosses Kanagawa , it forms natural levees in the soft soils of the alluvial plains of central Kanagawa , and forms almost no river delta as it exits into the ocean . The potential of the upper reaches of the Sagami River for hydroelectric power development began to be developed in the 1930s , with the growth of industry and electrical consumption in the Yokohama-Kanagawa industrial belt , and the growing need for a reliable supply of drinking and industrial water . Work on the Sagami Dam began in 1938 ; however , lack of funding and the advent of World War II delayed completion until after the end of the war . In the post war period , the Shiroyama Dam was also completed on the main stream of the Sagami River in 1965 . A number of dams have also been completed on the Nakatsu River , the main tributary of the Sagami River , including the Miyagase Dam .

Joe Principe ( born November 13 , 1974 ) is the bass guitarist , backing vocalist and co-founder of the punk rock band Rise Against . He is known for his elaborate bass patterns in their songs . He primarily uses Fender basses , Mesa amps and cabinets , and he uses pick-playing exclusively . He is also a strict vegetarian , an animal rights advocate and actively promotes PETA with his band . Joe began his musical career at age 15 , learning to play by ear and influenced during his formative years by Bad Religion , Minor Threat , Bad Brains , the Descendents and other like minded bands . Starting out in Chicago punk band 88 Fingers Louie . After 6 years of touring and releasing records with the band , Joe formed Rise Against with singer\/guitarist Tim McIlrath , former 88FL guitarist Mr. Precision , and drummer Brandon Barnes . In 2002 , Mr. Precison left and was replaced by Todd Mohney , who was replaced by Chris Chasse in 2004 , who was later replaced by guitarist Zach Blair in 2007 . Rise Against released their first two records ( The Unraveling , and Revolutions per Minute ) on Fat Wreck Chords , and their next three ( Siren Song of the Counter Culture , The Sufferer & the Witness , Appeal to Reason ) on Geffen , and their next album Endgame was released on Interscope . In the spring and summer of 1994 , he worked for a few months at Rotz Records , in the infamous basement warehouse . He was fired for incorrectly packaging CDs for The Offspring 's third album Smash . Joe currently resides in suburban Chicago with his wife , Elena and their dog , Dante and their son . He had also stated his favorite food is pizza . In fact his fellow bandmembers confirmed the fact that it was common for Joe to eat pizza every day . He even has a ` Pizza ' tattoo , as seen on the Generation Lost DVD documentary . Along with fellow bandmates Tim McIlrath and Zach Blair , Joe is straight edge . With the follow-up The Sufferer & the Witness poised to sustain Rise Againstâ s momentum , Principe has continued his own steady improvement as a musician . Previously a busier player , Joe focused on refining his interactions with the other instruments . â I made a conscious effort to let the guitars shine and to keep the rhythm with the drums . I didnâ t want to do anything too flashy . â For most of the albumâ s tracks , Principe extended this no-frills approach to his tone . A pick and a touch of distortion were his building blocks , with a handful of studio rigs allowing him to find the right tone for each song : â I recorded with around five different setups , so we were able to blend whatever we wanted . â However , Principe did allow himself to try something radically different on The Good Left Undone , which features a mellow break led by a layered bass-chord dirge . â Yeah , â he laughs . â That was four tracks of bass using an EBow . I imagined something where there wouldnâ t be any attack from the bassâ '' just sound . The engineer , Jason , said , â Weâ ve got to get an EBow . â So we did . â Though he took more of a supporting role on Sufferer & the Witness , Joe still added a tasteful selection of his trademark fills and runs . â I did more low-register bass fills this time . Usually I go to the upper octave on a fill , but this time I stayed low . â Principe credits this move to years of playing along with his favorite recordings . â I spent hours and hours sitting next to a boombox , pressing play , rewind , play , rewind , and trying to learn other peoplesâ parts . â In addition to training his melodic sensibilities by â shredding with albums by Rancid and The Descendents , he also sweated along with NOFX and thrash metal bands such as Anthrax to develop his speed and stamina . Principe is as humble discussing his own playing as he is discussing his influences , and the sincerity of his approach to both shows in his bass lines . â Theyâ re probably not much for anyone else to listen to , but the melodies I play remind me of the Descendents . That influence came out on this album more than any other , which is one thing Iâ m pretty proud of . â http://www.seymourduncan.com/products/basslines/progressive-1/sjb3_quarterpou/

Courtemanche is situated on the D155 road , some 30 m southeast of Amiens . Le Crotoy is a commune in the Somme department in Picardie in northern France . The inhabitants are known as Crotellois Le Crotoy is situated on the D143 and D71 crossroads , on the estuary of the river Somme , some 10 m northwest of Abbeville . Today , the town is a lively seaside resort whose beach is undoubtedly one of its main assets . It also benefits from the proximity of Marquentera ( Park of Marquenterre ) , an area of natural beauty , with lakes , marshes and a rich flora and fauna . The beach is highly unusual for northern French beaches in that it faces south . In terms of wildlife the bay supports a population of seals and shags . There are numerous restaurants in the village and it is well equipped with shops and a petrol station . Bed & breakfast accommodation is also available . Le Crotoy is one terminus of the narrow gauge `` Chemin de Fer de la Baie de Somme '' ( Somme Bay Railway ) , which is now largely a tourist attraction . Running around the entire length of the bay , this railway connects Le Crotoy with Noyelles-sur-Mer , Saint-Valery-sur-Somme , and Cayeux-sur-Mer and the sands at Brighton Plage . Main line trains to Paris take about 2 hours and cost about 48Euro return for an adult . They run from the nearby ( 15 mins by car ) station of Noyelles-sur-Mer , which is also a station on the `` Chemin de Fer de la Baie de Somme '' narrow gauge railway . The bay of the river Somme has interesting tides in that they are both fast and have a high rise and fall . At low tide it is possible to walk across the sand and mud flats from Le Crotoy to Saint-Valery-sur-Somme . Care needs to be taken as the tides come in very quickly . Fishing predominates , both for seafish and shellfish ( mostly cockles and mussels ) and from the coastal saltmarshes , samphire and sea-aster . Hunting and shooting , for both game and wildfowl provides food for locals and visitors alike . Sheep-rearing , on salty pastures , produces a unique flavor . The sheep of the Somme bay have been credited â appellation d'origine contrÃ lÃ e ( AOC ) â .

The Burig , or Purik , are another group of Tibetan Muslims with small dardic admixture , who live south of the Balti in Ladakh . Most of them live in Ladakh and Baltistan , especially in Kargil , although significant numbers reside in Leh . Because they inhabit the higher reaches of the arid Himalayas , they depend on glacial runoff for irrigatation their crops . Barley , wheat , and millet are grown where water is sufficient , notably along small rivers . The hot summer temperatures also allow for a wide variety of fruits to be raised . Unlike the Dards and the Shina , the Burig are not nomads . They transfer their livestock from one grazing ground to another upon the arrival of autumn . During the summer months , they drive the cattle to alpine pastures , and all households own at least one female dzo , which is a cross between a cow and a yak . These animals produce milk . Most of them are Shia Muslims by religion , although significant Sunni Muslims and a small minority of Buddhists and BÃ n followers reside in isolated areas . Like the Balti , they speak an archaic Tibetan dialect very closely related to both Balti and Ladakhi and mutually intelligible with both .

Capri pants ( also known as Capris , long or three-quarter shorts , and clam diggers ) are mid-calf pants worn in warm weather . Variants end below the knee and calf . Though widely popular with women they are also worn by men in many countries , especially in Europe and Latin America . Capri pants were introduced by European fashion designer Sonja de Lennart in 1948 . The pants ' name derives from the Italian isle of Capri , where they were rose to popularity in the late 1950s and early 1960s . The American actress Grace Kelly was among the first movie stars who wore capris on the island . Capris acceptance in the United States was influenced by the 1960s television series The Dick Van Dyke Show . The character of Laura Petrie , the young housewife played by Mary Tyler Moore , caused a fashion sensation -- and some mild controversy -- by wearing snug-fitting capri pants during the show 's run . After a drop in popularity during the 1970s through the 1990s capris returned to favor during the 2000s . Spanish tennis player Rafael Nadal wore capris in the majority of his matches before 2009 .

Hiroshima is the title of a magazine article written by Pulitzer winner John Hersey that appeared in The New Yorker in August 1946 , one year after the United States dropped an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima , Japan , at 8:15 a.m. , August 6 , 1945 . The article was soon made into a book . Each account is followed by a brief statement describing how close each person was to the center of the blast . Though Collier 's Weekly had previously published an account of the bombing , the editors of the New Yorker recognized the impact that the article would have by providing a human face to the victims , and devoted the entire August 31 , 1946 edition to it . Although the four chapters were intended for serialization in four consecutive issues of the magazine , the editors decided to devote one entire issue only to it . There were no other articles and none of the magazine 's signature cartoons . Readers , who had never before been exposed to the horrors of nuclear war from the perspective of the actual people who lived through it , were quick to pick up copies , and the edition sold out within just a few hours . The article was read in its entirety over the radio and discussed by newspapers . Shortly after it appeared , the Book-of-the-Month Club printed it as a book and distributed it free of charge to all of its members . Only in Japan was the distribution of the book discouraged by the American Occupation Government . Despite its popularity , the book , which appeared as the Cold War was gaining momentum , faced some criticism by people who either felt it was too sympathetic to the victims , thereby challenging the use of nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union , and by others who felt that Hersey 's tone was too dry and journalistic . Nevertheless , the book is still popular today , and often cited by anti-nuclear weapons activists . Modern editions of the book contain a final , fifth chapter , The Aftermath , written forty years after the original article . In it , Hersey returned to Japan to discover what happened to the six people he originally interviewed in the ensuing years : Actor John Valentine adapted the book into a radio play , which was recorded for Pacifica Radio Archives , in association with Artists United and the Feminist Majority . The recording was directed by Michael Haney with music by Mark Snow . It was broadcast in 2004 and featured actors Tyne Daly , Ruby Dee , Roscoe Lee Brown , Daniel Benzali , Esther K. Chae , Michael Chinyamurindi , Tony Plana , Jeanne Sakata , Chris Tashima , and Valentine .
The Yorkshire Dales is the name given to an upland area in Northern England . The area lies within the historic county boundaries of Yorkshire , though it spans the ceremonial counties of North Yorkshire , West Yorkshire and Cumbria . Most of the area falls within the Yorkshire Dales National Park , created in 1954 , and now one of the fifteen National parks of Britain , but the term also includes areas to the east of the National Park , notably Nidderdale . . The Dales is a collection of river valleys and the hills among them , rising from the Vale of York westwards to the hilltops of the main Pennine watershed ( the British English meaning ) . In some places the area even extends westwards across the watershed , but most of the valleys drain eastwards to the Vale of York , into the Ouse and then the Humber . The word dale comes from the Nordic\/Germanic word for valley ( dal , tal ) , and occurs in valley names across Yorkshire ( and Northern England generally ) but the name Yorkshire Dales is generally used to refer specifically to the dales west of the Vale of York and north of the West Yorkshire Urban Area . The Yorkshire Dales is served by its own radio station , Fresh Radio , which broadcasts programs from studio bases in Skipton and Richmond . Most of the dales in the Yorkshire Dales are named after their river or stream ( e.g. Arkengarthdale , formed by Arkle Beck ) . The best-known exception to this rule is Wensleydale , which is named after the town of Wensley rather than the River Ure , although an older name for the dale is Yoredale . In fact , valleys all over Yorkshire are called '' ( name of river ) + dale '' â '' but only the more northern Yorkshire valleys ( and only the upper , rural , reaches ) are included in the term `` The Dales '' . For example , the southern boundary area lies in Wharfedale and Airedale . The lower reaches of these valleys are not usually included in the area and Calderdale much further south , would not normally be referred to as part of `` The Dales '' even though it is a dale , is in Yorkshire , and the upper reaches are as scenic and rural as many valleys further north . Geographically , the classical Yorkshire Dales spread to the north from the market and spa towns of Settle , Deepdale near Dent , Skipton , Ilkley and Harrogate in North Yorkshire , with most of the larger southern dales ( e.g. Ribblesdale , Malhamdale and Airedale , Wharfedale and Nidderdale ) running roughly parallel from north to south . The more northerly dales ( e.g. Wensleydale , Swaledale and Teesdale ) running generally from west to east . There are also many other smaller or lesser known dales ( e.g. Arkengarthdale , Barbondale , Bishopdale , Clapdale , Coverdale , Dentdale and Deepdale , Garsdale , Kingsdale , Littondale , Langstrothdale , Raydale , Waldendale and the Washburn Valley ) whose tributary streams and rivers feed into the larger valleys . The characteristic scenery of the Dales is green upland pastures separated by dry-stone walls and grazed by sheep and cattle . The dales themselves are ` U ' and ` V ' shaped valleys , which were enlarged and shaped by glaciers , mainly in the most recent , Devensian ice age . The underlying rock is principally Carboniferous limestone ( which results in a number of areas of limestone pavement ) in places interspersed with shale and sandstone and topped with Millstone Grit . However , to the north of the Dent fault , the hills are principally older Silurian and Ordovician rocks , which make up the Howgill Fells . Many of the upland areas consist of heather moorland , used for grouse shooting in the months following 12 August each year ( the ` Glorious Twelfth ' ) . Because of the limestone that runs throughout the Dales , there are extensive cave systems present across the area , making it one of the major areas for caving in the UK . Many of these are open to the public for tours and for caving . In 1954 an area of 1770 k was designated the Yorkshire Dales National Park . Most of the National Park is in North Yorkshire , though part lies within Cumbria . However , the whole park lies within the historic boundaries of Yorkshire , divided between the North Riding and the West Riding . The park is 50 m north east of Manchester ; Leeds and Bradford lie to the south , while Kendal is to the west and Darlington to the east . Over 20,000 residents live and work in the park , which attracts over eight million visitors every year . The area has a large collection of activities for visitors . For example , many people come to the Dales for walking or exercise . The National Park is crossed by several long-distance routes including the Pennine Way , the Dales Way , the Coast to Coast Path and the latest national trailâ '' the Pennine Bridleway . Cycling is also popular and there are several cycleways . The Park has its own museum , the Dales Countryside Museum , housed in a conversion of the Hawes railway station in Wensleydale in the north area . The park has five visitor centres located in major destinations in the park . These are at :
A wheelwright ( or wainwright ) is a person who builds or repairs wheels . The word is the combination of `` wheel '' and the archaic word `` wright '' , which comes from the Old English word `` wryhta '' , meaning a worker or maker . This occupational name eventually became the English surname Wheelwright . Historically , these tradesmen made wheels for carts and wagons by first constructing the hub , the spokes and the rim\/fellows segments , and assembling them all into a unit working from the center of the wheel outwards . Most wheels were made from wood , but other materials have been used , such as bone and horn , for decorative or other purposes . Around the middle of the 19th century , iron strakes were replaced by a solid iron tyre custom made by a blacksmith , who first measured each wheel to ensure proper fit . Strakes were lengths of iron that were nailed to the outside of wheels to hold wooden wheels together . Strakes were replaced around the mid-19th century by more dependable iron tires that were fastened to the wooden wheel by both the tight fit of the tire\/band as well as tire-bolts . Tire-bolts were less likely than tyre-nails to break off because they were flush with the wheel 's outer surface . During the second half of the 19th century , the use of pre-manufactured iron hubs , and other factory-made wood , iron and rubber wheel parts became increasingly common . In modern times , wheelwrights continue to make and repair a wide variety of wheels , including those made from wood and banded by iron tyres . The word wheelwright remains a term usually used for someone who makes and repairs wheels for horse drawn vehicles , even though it is sometimes used to refer to someone who repairs wheels , wheel alignment , rims , drums , discs and wire spokes on modern vehicles such as automobiles , buses and trucks . Wheels for horse-drawn vehicles continue to be constructed and repaired for use by people who use horse-drawn vehicles for farming , equine ( horse ) competitions , and presentations of historical events such as reenactments and living history .
Savoie ( Arpitan : SavouÃ dâ AvÃ cents l , Italian : Savoia , English : Savoy ) is a French department located in the RhÃ ne-Alpes region in the French Alps . It is one of the two departments of the region of Savoy that was annexed by France on March 24 , 1860 after the Treaty of Turin , the other being Haute-Savoie . For history before 1860 , details of the annexation and reasons for the current separatist movement in the departments , see Savoy . It is widely accepted that Savoie takes its name from the Latin Sapaudia or Sabaudia , meaning land covered in fir trees . Savoie was long part of the states of Savoy , though it was occupied many times by France starting in the 16th century . It was integrated into the Mont-Blanc department from 1792 to 1815 ( and partially into the LÃ man department from 1798 to 1814 ) , later being annexed by France in 1860 . The former Duchy of Savoy became the two departments of Savoie and Haute-Savoie . MoÃ '' tiers , capital of the former province of Tarentaise Valley ( French : VallÃ e de la Tarentaise ) ceased to be the county seat after a law passed on September 10 , 1926 . Savoie , along with Albertville , hosted the 1992 Winter Olympics , with ski events at Tarentaise and Beaufortain . Savoie is part of the RhÃ ne-Alpes rÃ gion . It borders the departments of Haute-Savoie , Ain , IsÃ re and Hautes-Alpes in addition to Italy . The department is crossed by the IsÃ re river , which has its source in the Iseran pass . Its two main lakes are Lac du Bourget ( the largest and deepest lake entirely in France ) and Lac d'Aiguebelette , one of the least polluted in France due to a 1976 law forbidding any use of motorboats on the lake . According to the ChambÃ ry chamber of commerce , close to 50 % of the department 's wealth comes from tourism . Each year , Savoie hosts over 30 million visitor-nights of tourists . Savoie also profits from its natural resources with particular strengths in ore processing and hydroelectric power . Savoie had an exceptionally high export\/import ratio of 214 % in 2005 . Its exports rose to â 1.768 billion â 825 million in imports . Its leading exports were steel , aluminum , and electric and electronic components . Numerous wines are also grown in Savoie . The most famous are made of Gamay , Pinot Noir and Mondeuse grapes . Fruit production is the third largest component of agriculture in Savoie . Residents of Savoie are known as Savoyards though they can also be called Savoisiens ( the historical name ) or Savoyens . The average population density is not a good indication of actual population density , as valleys tend to be quite densely populated , whereas the mountains tend to be near-completely uninhabited . The Catholic Church in Savoie is divided into three dioceses : ChambÃ ry , Maurienne and Tarentaise . Together , they form an archdiocese , in which the bishop of ChambÃ ry is the archbishop . Tourism , which is quite important to Savoie , began to develop towards the end of the 19th century , mostly summer oriented . The increase in the popularity of skiing in the 20th century made Savoie home to the largest number of ski hills in France , including many famous ones : Hydrotherapy , practiced in the region since antiquity , is also quite developed .

The term Piedmont blues ( also known as East Coast blues ) refers primarily to a guitar style , the Piedmont fingerstyle , which is characterized by a fingerpicking approach in which a regular , alternating thumb bass string rhythmic pattern supports a syncopated melody using the treble strings generally picked with the fore-finger , occasionally others . The result is comparable in sound to ragtime or stride piano styles . The term was coined by blues researcher Peter B. Lowry , who in turn gives co-credit to fellow folklorist Bruce Bastin . The Piedmont style is differentiated from other styles , particularly the Mississippi Delta style , by its ragtime-based rhythms It was an extremely popular form of southern African-American dance music for many decades in the first half of the 20th century . The basis of the Piedmont style began with the older `` frailing '' or `` framming '' guitar styles that may have been universal throughout the South , and was also based , at least to some extent , on formal `` parlor guitar '' techniques as well as earlier banjo playing , string band , and ragtime . What was particular to the Piedmont was that a generation of players adapted these older , ragtime-based techniques to blues in a singular and popular fashion , influenced by guitarists such as Blind Blake and Gary Davis . The Piedmont blues was named after the Piedmont plateau region , on the East Coast of the United States from about Richmond , Virginia to Atlanta , Georgia . Piedmont blues musicians come from this area , as well as Maryland , Delaware , West Virginia , Pennsylvania and northern Florida , western South Carolina central North Carolina , eastern Tennessee , Kentucky , and Alabama - later the Northeastern cities like Boston , Newark , NJ or New York . Recording artists such as Blind Blake , Josh White , Buddy Moss , and Blind Boy Fuller helped spread the style on the strength of their sales throughout the region . It was a nationally popular with the African-American audience for about twenty years from the mid-1920s through to the mid-1940s . Blind Boy Fuller 's 1940 recording of `` Step It Up & Go '' sold over half a million copies to both blacks and whites . This one style essentially overrode all other local styles on record over a vast area of the American South East . As a form of Black American popular music , Piedmont blues fell out of favor on a national basis after World War II , but remained popular at house parties throughout the South East and with older African Americans . It still had a very danceable beat . By the 1960s Piedmont blues was being performed at US folk music revivals and festivals by established Piedmont blues artists such as Josh White , Rev. Gary Davis , and Brownie McGhee & Sonny Terry , as well as Cephas & Wiggins , John Jackson , Turner & Marvin Foddrell , and Henry Johnson . While musicologists such as George Mitchell , Peter B. Lowry and Tim Duffy collected recordings by the aging community of Piedmont Blues players , younger musicians such as Roy Book Binder , Jorma Kaukonen , Paul Geremia , Keb Mo ' , Michael Roach , Samuel James and Guy Davis have carried on the Piedmont tradition , often having `` studied '' under some of the old Piedmont masters . The Piedmont style of guitar playing has also influenced other popular musicians such as Doc Watson , Paul Simon , Nick Drake and Mark Knopfler .
The Misquah Hills are a range of large hills or small mountains in northeastern Minnesota , in the United States . They are located in or near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness within Superior National Forest . They contain Eagle Mountain , the highest point in Minnesota at 2301 feet ( 701 meters ) . The Misquah Hills are oriented east-to-west , south of Cross Lake and Winchell Lake . Their peaks are all within four miles east and seven miles west of Misquah Lake , and include several of the highest points in Minnesota , including Eagle Mountain , Lima Mountain ( 2238 ft ) , Gaskin Mountain ( 2245 ft ) , Brule Mountain ( 2226 ft ) , Pine Mountain ( 2194 ft ) , and Peak 2266 . Their total elevation above the surrounding plateau does not exceed 600 feet , although they reach roughly 1700 feet above nearby Lake Superior at Eagle Mountain , the highest point in Minnesota at 2301 feet ( 701 meters ) above sea level . Still , at this elevation they are the highest points for nearly a thousand miles in any direction , as well as the second-highest range of the Canadian Shield in the US , after the Adirondack Mountains . The bedrock of the Misquah Hills is a granophyre within the Duluth Complex , a relatively recent addition to the larger Precambrian rock formations of the Canadian Shield . This complex was formed during the Midcontinent Rift event . The rock type of the Misquah Hills ranges from granite to quartz monzonite to monzodiorite . These rocks date to 1106.0 Â 5.1 Ma , placing them in the middle of the Stenian period of the Mesoproterozoic era . The Misquahs are geological cousins of the Adirondacks and the Laurentian Mountains of Quebec ; they bear some visual resemblance to these ranges , though on a smaller scale . The Misquah Hills are thickly forested , though there are granite outcrops and bare summit rocks in some places . The forest cover consists largely of balsam fir and varieties of spruce ; eastern white pine , red pine , quaking aspen , paper birch , and northern white cedar are also common in the area . The Misquahs are part of the Northern Boreal Forest . The Misquah Hills were surveyed by Newton H. Winchell , Minnesota state geologist , and Ulysses S. Grant II in the 1890s , who , using an aneroid barometer mistakenly gave the title of highest peak in Minnesota to an unnamed 2230-foot summit near what is now called Winchell Lake . A United States Department of the Interior survey team remeasured several summits in the Misquahs in 1961 , using aerial photographs and benchmarking ( geolocating ) , resulting in the current set of height measurements . Hiking in the Misquah Hills has long been overshadowed by the vast amount of excellent canoeing in the lakes of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness . Many of the peaks remain unnamed , most are only accessible by water , and only Eagle Mountain , Lima Mountain , and Pine Mountain have summit trails .
<!----> Luxembourg ( Dutch : , also German ; , Walloon : Lussimbork ) is the southernmost province of Wallonia and of Belgium . It borders on ( clockwise from the East ) the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg , France , and the Belgian provinces of Namur and LiÃ ge . Its capital is Arlon , in the south-east of the province . It has an area of 4,443 kmÂ , making it the largest Belgian province . At around a quarter of a million residents , it is also the province with the smallest number of inhabitants making it the most sparsely populated region in a densely populated country . Luxembourg province is divided into five administrative districts ( arrondissements in French ) containing 44 municipalities . The province also covers two regions ( of Wallonia , one of the three actual official regions of Belgium ) : the Ardennes on the north part and the Belgian Lorraine ( of which the Gaume is the Roman part ) on the south part . The province was separated from the neighbouring Luxembourg by the Third Partition of Luxembourg in 1839 , after the Belgian Revolution , and declared to remain a part of Belgium . The residents of Luxembourg are mostly Francophone , but there is a small Luxembourgish-speaking minority , in Arelerland , near the border with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg . The tricolor is official , but not in use . The many-striped flag is not official , but is in use .
`` Pueblo '' is a term used to describe modern ( and ancient ) communities of Native Americans in the Southwestern United States of America . The first Spanish Explorers of the Southwest used this term to describe communities that consisted of apartment-like structures made from stone , adobe mud , and other local material . These structures were usually multi-storied buildings surrounding an open plaza and were occupied by hundreds to thousands of Pueblo People . The Castilian word pueblo , evolved from the Latin word populus ( people ) , meaning `` town '' . Of the federally recognized Native American communities in the Southwest , those designated by the King of Spain as Pueblo at the time treaties ceded Spanish territory to the United States are now legally recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs as Pueblo . Some of the Pueblo also came into the United States by treaty with Mexico , which briefly gained jurisdiction over territory in the Southwest ceded by Spain . There are 21 federally recognized Pueblos that are home to Pueblo people . As listed by their official federal names : Pre-Columbian towns and villages in the Southwest were located in defensive positions , for example , on high steep mesas such as Acoma . Anthropologists and official documents often refer to earlier residents of the area as pueblo cultures . For example , the National Park Service states , `` The Late Puebloan cultures built the large , integrated villages found by the Spaniards when they began to move into the area . '' The people of some pueblos , such as Taos Pueblo , still inhabit centuries-old adobe pueblo buildings . Residents often maintain other homes outside the historic pueblos . Adobe and light construction methods resembling adobe now dominate architecture at the many pueblos of the area , in nearby towns or cities and in much of the American Southwest . In addition to contemporary pueblos , there are numerous ruins of archeological interest throughout the Southwest . Some are of relatively recent origin ; others are of prehistoric origin such as the cliff dwellings and other habitations of the Ancient Pueblo Peoples or Anasazi .

Emperor Kaika ; also known as Wakayamatonekohikooobi no Mikoto ; is the 9th emperor of Japan , according to the traditional order of succession . No firm dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign , but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 157 BC-98 BC , but he may have lived in the early 1st century . Modern scholars have come to question the existence of at least the first nine emperors ; and Kaika 's son Emperor Sujin is the first many agree might have actually existed , in third or fourth century . The name Kaika-tenn Å was assigned to him posthumously by later generations . Kaika is regarded by historians as a `` legendary emperor '' and there is a paucity of information about him . There is insufficient material available for further verification and study . The reign of Emperor Kimmei ( 509-571 ) , the 29th emperor of Japan according to the traditional order of succession , is the first for which contemporary historiography are able to assign verifiable dates ; however , the conventionally accepted names and dates of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as `` traditional '' until the reign of Emperor Kammu ( 737 â `` 806 ) , the 50th sovereign of the Yamato dynasty . In Kojiki and Nihonshoki , only his name and genealogy were recorded . The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign 's historical existence , and an Imperial misasagi or tomb for Kaika is currently maintained ; however , no extant contemporary records have been discovered which confirm a view that this historical figure actually reigned . He was the eighth of eight emperors without specific legends associated with them , also known as the `` eight undocumented monarchs '' . Jien records that Kaika was the second son of Emperor KÅ gen , and that he ruled from the palace of Isakawa-no-miya at Kasuga in what will come to be known as Yamato province . Kaika is a posthumous name . It is undisputed that this identification is Chinese in form and Buddhist in implication , which suggests that the name must have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Kaika , possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the Yamato dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the Kojiki . The actual site of Kaika 's grave is not known . This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ( misasagi ) at Nara . The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Kaika 's mausoleum . It is formally named Kasuga no Izakawa no sak no e no misasagi .
Luigi `` Gigi '' Radice ( born January 15 , 1935 , in Cesano Maderno ) is an Italian football coach and former player . He played in Serie A for teams such as Milan , Triestina and Padova . Radice was also a member of the Italian squad for the World Cup in 1962 . However , injuries had cut short his playing career . As a coach , he earned the distinction of being the first and so far only coach to lead Torino to the Scudetto since the Superga tragedy in 1949 , when they won the title in the 1975-76 season . Radice has also coached a number of other Serie A teams , including Inter , Roma and Fiorentina , as well as Cesena when the team was in the lower division . In the 1992-93 season Fiorentina was entrusted to Radice . The team started well , and at the turn of the year was sitting in second place , having scored 15 points in the first 13 matches . However , a mid-season feud with the club 's chairman Vittorio Cecchi Gori led to the departure of Radice , and Fiorentina nose-dived in the standings . They scored only 15 more points in the remaining 21 matches , and finished only 16th . The result was relegation to Serie B.

Alt-Zabrze was mentioned in 1295-1305 as Sadbre sive Cunczindorf ( sive = or ) . In the Late Middle Ages , the local Silesian Piast dukes invited German settlers into the territory resulting in increasing German settlement . Zabrze became part of the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria in 1526 , and was later annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia during the Silesian Wars . In 1774 , the Dorotheendorf settlement was founded . When the first mine in Zabrze became operational in 1790 , the town became an important mining center . In 1905 , the Zabrze commune was formed by the former communes Alt-Zabrze , Klein-Zabrze and Dorotheendorf . The Zabrze commune was renamed Hindenburg in 1915 in honor of Generalfeldmarschall Paul von Hindenburg . The name change was approved by Emperor Wilhelm II on 21 February 1915 . During the plebiscite held after World War I , 21,333 inhabitants ( 59 % ) of the Hindenburg commune voted to remain in Germany , while 14,873 ( 41 % ) voted for incorporation to Poland . In May 1921 the Third Silesian Uprising broke out and Hindenburg was captured by Polish insurgents , who held it until the end of the uprising . When Upper Silesia was divided between Poland and Germany in 1921 , the Hindenburg commune remained in Germany . It received its city charter in 1922 . Just five years after founding Hindenburg became the biggest city in German Upper Silesia and the second biggest City in German Silesia after Breslau . In the March 1933 elections , most of the citizens voted for Nazi Party , followed by Zentrum and the Communist Party . Nazi politician Max Fillusch became city 's mayor and remained in the position until 1945 . The town 's synagogue , that had stood since 1872 , was destroyed in the Kristallnacht pogroms of November 1938 . Following World War II , the city was assigned to Poland in 1945 and was renamed back to Zabrze on May 19 , 1945 . Most of the German inhabitants were expelled . Like other towns in this populous region , it is an important manufacturing center , having coal-mines , iron , wire , glass , chemical and oil works , breweries , etc.

literary magazine `` Partisan Review '' ( Boston ) . Partisan Review ( PR ) was an American political and literary quarterly published from 1934 to 2003 , though it suspended publication between October 1936 and December 1937 . The journal was founded by William Phillips , Philip Rahv , and Sender Garlin . It grew out of the John Reed Club as an alternative to New Masses , the publication of the American Communist Party , but became staunchly anti-Communist after Joseph Stalin secured his place at the head of the Soviet Union . Many of its early authors were the children of Jewish immigrants from Europe . Rarely having more than ten thousand subscribers , the journal reached its peak influence from the late 1930s to the early 1960s , after which it gradually lost its relevance . Phillips died in September 2002 at age 94 . The journal continued under his wife Edith Kurzweil , through an agreement with Boston University , until ceasing publication in April 2003 . Contributors included Conor Cruise O'Brien , Saul Bellow , Doris Lessing , Philip Roth , Lionel Trilling , Irving Howe , Dwight Macdonald , Hannah Arendt , Mary McCarthy , Clement Greenberg , and Susan Sontag . George Orwell , in reply to a letter from Philip Rahv requesting names of possible contributors for PR , offered the following : Alex Comfort , Henry Treece , Alun Lewis , William Rogers , G. S. Fraser , Roy Fuller , Kathleen Raine , who all contributed to Poetry London . Older people he proposed included Herbert Read , T. S. Eliot , Stephen Spender , Louis MacNeice , and `` their lot , '' E. M. Forster ( `` who has seen and likes PR '' ) , William Empson , Jack Common , Hugh Slater , Ahmed Ali , and Roy Campbell . Between 1941 and 1946 Orwell wrote fifteen `` London Letters '' for the Review , the first of which appeared in the March-April 1941 issue . In 1949 , the journal awarded Orwell Â # 357 for the year 's most significant contribution to literature , Nineteen Eighty-Four . The September-October 1942 issue of PR carried Orwell 's reply to letters sent in by D. S. Savage , George Woodcock , and Alex Comfort in response to his `` London Letter '' of the March-April issue , in which he criticized `` left-wing defeatism '' and `` turn-the-other-cheek '' pacifists , stating that they were `` objectively pro-Fascist '' . In his article he had mentioned several people by name , including Comfort , and accused the review Now , of which Woodcock was editor , of having a Fascist tendency .

Yosemite Falls is the highest measured waterfall in North America . Located in Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevada of California , it is a major attraction in the park , especially in late spring when the water flow is at its peak . The total 2425 f from the top of the upper falls to the base of the lower falls qualifies Yosemite Falls as the sixth highest waterfall in the world , though with the recent discovery of Gocta Cataracts , it appears on some lists as seventh . In years of little snow , the falls may actually cease flowing altogether in late summer or fall . A very small number of rock climbers have taken the opportunity to climb the normally inaccessible rock face beneath the falls , although this is an extraordinarily dangerous undertaking ; a single afternoon thunderstorm could restart the falls , sweeping the climbers off the face . The Lower Falls are easily accessible near the Yosemite Lodge in Yosemite Valley . The top of the Upper Falls may be reached via a steep , strenuous , and usually crowded 3.5 m hike beginning near the Sunnyside Walk-in Campground . The Upper Falls may also be reached via several routes from the Tioga Road to the north . The Ahwahneechee people of Yosemite Valley called the waterfall `` Cholock '' and believed that the plunge pool at its base was inhabited by the spirits of several witches , called the Poloti . An Ahwaneechee folktale describes a woman going to fetch a pail of water from the pool , and drawing it out full of snakes . Later that night , after the woman had trespassed into their territory , the spirits caused the woman 's house to be sucked into the pool by a powerful wind , taking the woman and her newborn baby with her .
Bruce George Gamble ( May 24 , 1938 â `` December 29 , 1982 ) was a professional ice hockey goaltender who played 10 seasons in the NHL between 1962 and 1972 , with some years in the minor leagues in between . In the NHL he played 2 games with the New York Rangers , 80 for the Boston Bruins , 210 as a Leaf and finally 35 as a Philadelphia Flyer to end his career . Bruce played 3 seasons with the Port Arthur Bruins of the Thunder Bay Junior Hockey League between 1953 and 1955 . In the 1955 â `` 56 season , he backstopped the Port Arthur North Stars to a Memorial Cup berth . The next season he did so again with the Guelph Biltmores of the OHA , and was elected to the 1957 OHA first All-Star team . He made it to the Memorial Cup a third time with the Hull-Ottawa Canadiens , the following year . Gamble played his first year as a pro with the Vancouver Canucks of the WHL , and received his first 2 game call-up with the New York Rangers . His performance impressed other NHL teams , and the Boston Bruins chose him in the 1959 Intra-League Draft . After a year with Providence Reds in the AHL , Gamble was the team 's starting goalie in 1960 â `` 61 . During the next 4 seasons he played mainly in the minors ( Portland Buckaroos , Kingston Frontenacs ( EPHL ) and Springfield Indians ) , tallying only 28 games for the Bruins in 1961 â `` 62 . After refusing to go back to the minors for Eddie Shore in 1964 â `` 65 , the Bruins suspended him from Springfield for the entire season . Gamble got his way the following year by being traded to the Leafs . For the first couple seasons Gamble had trouble trying to establish himself , playing behind Hall of Famers Johnny Bower and Terry Sawchuk . However in 1966 â `` 67 , the Leafs won the Stanley Cup , and he contributed by playing in 23 regular season games going 5 â `` 10 â `` 4 with a GAA of 3.39 . However , Gamble was sent to the minors to play for the Tulsa Oilers , before the trading deadline . He did not spend the whole season with Toronto , and his name was left off the Stanley Cup . After this , along with NHL expansion , Gamble had his best years playing in 41 games in 1967 â `` 68 , 62 in 1968 â `` 69 ( going 28 â `` 20 â `` 11 and a GAA of 2.80 ) and 44 in 1969 â `` 70 , while being traded mid-season to the Flyers in a deal that saw Bernie Parent go to Toronto . He was the MVP of the 21st National Hockey League All-Star Game in 1968 . The next season saw his NHL career end from a heart attack that had its onset while he was tending goal for the Philadelphia Flyers in a 3-1 win , on February 8 , 1972 , over the Vancouver Canucks . Although he fell at one point during the game , he did not complain of problems until afterward , and traveled with the team to Oakland on February 9 in preparation for a game that evening against the California Golden Seals . As his chest pains continued , Gamble was admitted to an Oakland hospital where it was found that he had had a heart attack . . Gamble did not play in the NHL again . Ten years later Gamble died of another heart attack , hours after a practice session with an `` old-timers '' hockey team , the Niagara Falls Flames . On December 29 , 1982 , after a practice session the evening before with the Flames , Gamble woke up with chest pains , and died at a hospital in Niagara Falls , Ontario at the age of 44 . Because Gamble suffered both heart attacks after playing or practicing hockey , erroneous accounts have been written that he was taken to a hospital during the 1972 NHL game , or that he `` died during an old-timer 's game '' . Neither of Gamble 's heart attacks disabled him while he was on the ice , although both had their onset soon afterward .

Seven Sisters station is a National Rail and London Underground Victoria Line station in the Seven Sisters area of the London Borough of Haringey , north London . The station is in Travelcard Zone 3 . Seven Sisters lies between Finsbury Park and Tottenham Hale on the Victoria Line and between Stamford Hill and Bruce Grove on the National Rail line operated by National Express East Anglia from Liverpool Street . It is a short walk from South Tottenham station on London Overground . The station was constructed by the Great Eastern Railway ( GER ) on its Stoke Newington & Edmonton Railway line and opened on 22 July 1872 . On 1 January 1878 , the GER opened a branch line , the Palace Gates Line , from Seven Sisters station to Palace Gates ( Wood Green ) station to the north-west . Due to unprofitability , the Palace Gates Line was closed by British Rail in 1963 and the branch line track and platforms at Seven Sisters have been removed . The first section of the Victoria Line opened on 1 September 1968 serving Seven Sisters , although a shared entrance and interchange facilities with the surface station were not opened until December 1968 . The original GER entrance to the station was situated in West Green Road at the north end of the surface station , but the new combined entrance was opened in Seven Sisters Road at the south end on the site of a former wood merchants yard , connecting to the west end of the Victoria Line platforms . The original ( 1872 ) entrance was closed at that time . A second entrance at the east end includes the main Victoria Line ticket hall , and is accessed via subways on each side of High Road just north of the junction with Seven Sisters Road . There are three Victoria Line platforms at Seven Sisters : with one platform reserved for northbound services which terminate at the station to return to the depot , although a connection is available for trains to continue to Walthamstow . The section of Victoria Line between Seven Sisters and Finsbury Park stations is the longest between adjacent stations in deep level tunnels on the London Underground network . During the planning phase of the Victoria Line , thought was given to converting Manor House into a Victoria Line station and diverting the Piccadilly Line in new tunnels directly from Finsbury Park to Turnpike Lane , but the inconvenience this would cause , as well as the cost , ensured that this idea was abandoned . Seven Sisters station is referenced in the song ` Seven Sisters Road ' by UK rock band Alien Stash Tin , and included on the bands 2007 eponymous album . The track was also issued as a single a year before . ` Seven Sisters Road ' is also the title of a different song recorded by The Dan Reed Network .
Ferdinando II de ' Medici ( 14 July 1610 -- 23 May 1670 ) was grand duke of Tuscany from 1621 to 1670 . He was the eldest child of Cosimo II de ' Medici and Maria Maddalena of Austria . His 49 year rule was punctuaded by the termination of the remaining operations of the Medici Bank , and the beginning of Tuscany 's long economic decline . He married Vittoria della Rovere , with whom he had two children : Cosimo III de ' Medici , his eventual successor , and Francesco Maria de ' Medici , a Prince of the Church . Ferdinando was the eldest son of Cosimo II de ' Medici , Grand Duke of Tuscany and Maria Maddalena of Austria . Cosimo II died when he was 10 ; because he had not yet reached legal maturity , his mother and paternal grandmother , Christina of Lorraine , acted as joint regents . Dowager Grand Duchess Christina brought Tuscany into the Popeâ s sphere of influence . In his seventeenth year , Ferdinando embarked on a tour of Europe . One year later , his regency ended and his personal rule began . Dowager Grand Duchess Christina was the power behind the throne until her demise in 1636 . The first calamity of Ferdinandoâ s reign was in 1630 , when a plague swept through Florence and took 10 % of the population with it . Unlike the Tuscan nobility , Ferdinando and his brothers stayed in the city to try to ameliorate the general suffering . His mother and grandmother arranged a marriage with Vittoria della Rovere , a granddaughter of the then incumbent Duke of Urbino , in 1634 . Together they had two children : Cosimo , in 1642 , and Francesco Maria de ' Medici , in 1660 . The latter was the fruit of a brief reconciliation , as after the birth of Cosimo , the two became estranged ; Vittoria caught Ferdinando in bed with a page , Count Bruto della Molera . Grand Duke Ferdinando was obsessed with new technology , and had several hygrometers , barometers , thermometers , and telescopes installed in the Pitti . In 1657 , Leopoldo de ' Medici , the Grand Dukeâ s youngest brother , established the Accademia del Cimento . It was set up to attract scientists from all over Tuscany to Florence for mutual study . Tuscany participated in the Wars of Castro ( the last time Medicean Tuscany was involved in a conflict ) and inflicted a defeat on the forces of Urban VIII in 1643 . The treasury was so empty that when the Castro mercenaries were paid for the state could no longer afford to pay interest on government bonds . The interest rate was lowered by 0.75 % . The economy was so decrepit that barter trade became prevalent in rural market places . Ferdinando died on 23 May 1670 of apoplexy and dropsy . He was interred in the Basilica of San Lorenzo , the Medici 's necropolis . At the time of his death , the population of the grand duchy was 730,594 souls ; the streets were lined with grass and the buildings on the verge of collapse in Pisa .

The British Rail Class 951 was reserved for former diesel-electric multiple units converted for departmental use . Units were converted for various tasks , including application of sandite , de-icing duties , and use as tractor units to tow other trains . This classification is now obsolete , as all units have either been withdrawn , or renumbered into the Class 930 range . Units were originally numbered from 1066 onwards . This was because the first unit converted were former Hastings units , and 1066 was the year the Battle of Hastings occurred . Units were subsequently renumbered into the 951066-070 range , although not all units survived long enough in traffic to receive their new set number . The main units are dealt with below .

Pizza Pizza is a Canadian franchise chain of pizza restaurants mainly located in the province of Ontario . Other locations operate in Quebec , Nova Scotia , in western Canada ( mostly through Alberta-based subsidiary Pizza 73 ) , and in non-traditional locations such as university campuses and movie theaters throughout Canada . It has over 500 locations , including over 150 non-traditional locations . The chain , founded and owned by Michael Overs , opened its first location on December 31 , 1967 , at the corner of Wellesley and Parliament Streets in Toronto . It expanded throughout the Toronto area in the 1970s , and throughout the rest of Ontario throughout the 1980s and 1990s . The chain opened in the Montreal area in late 2007 with locations in the Montreal boroughs of Notre-Dame-de-Gr Ã cents ce and Pierrefonds-Roxboro . Pizza Pizza has recently begun to expand significantly outside Ontario . In its 2005 IPO filings , the chain announced it would consider expansion in western Canada , potentially including purchasing existing local chains . This led to a June 2007 agreement to purchase Alberta-based Pizza 73 . As well , in October 2006 , the company announced it would expand in the Quebec market , beginning with sponsorship of the Montreal Canadiens . The chain expanded to the British Columbia Lower Mainland in 2009 ( Pizza 73 already had a location in Prince George in the B.C. Interior ) , and soon thereafter added locations in Manitoba and Saskatchewan . Pizza Pizza opened its first store in Halifax , Nova Scotia in June 2010 . In 2005 , the Pizza Pizza Royalty Income Fund , an open-ended trust , completed its initial public offering . Pizza Pizza Limited , which remains privately held by Overs son-in-law Paul Goddard , pays the Fund 6 % of the sales of its restaurants in Canada . Major southern Ontario competitors include Pizza Hut , Domino 's Pizza , Little Caesars , Gino 's Pizza , 241 Pizza , Double Double Pizza , and Pizza Nova . Two other major Canadian chains , Greco and Panago , which have a presence similar to Pizza Pizza in the Atlantic and Western Canada respectively , have also recently entered the Ontario market . In Montreal , Quebec , its competitors are Mikes and Double Pizza . Starting in 2009 , Coca-Cola products replaced Pepsi products at Pizza Pizza . Pizza Pizza currently uses the self-explanatory slogans `` Hot & Fresh '' and `` Ontario 's # 1 Pizza ! '' However , perhaps better known still is the chain 's Toronto phone number , ( 416-RRB - 967-1111 , the last four digits pronounced `` eleven-eleven '' to rhyme with `` seven '' . The company claims that its early adoption of the centralized single-number ordering system , and its subsequent use and heavy promotion of this rhyming phone number , helped the chain to grow and soon dominate the Ontario pizza market . In other areas , the local number usually ends in the `` 7-11-11 '' pattern to match a standard jingle used in the chain 's radio advertisements . Pizza Pizza has also registered `` 967-1111 '' and its variants as trademarks . `` 967-1111 '' is registered in Canada under registration number TMA428709 . It has also recently secured product placement on the television series Degrassi : The Next Generation . Outside of Ontario , Pizza Pizza has benefited from various pop-culture references . Toronto musicians Moxy FrÃ 1\/4 vous mention it in their song `` King of Spain '' . A chapter of Michael Moore 's book Downsize This ! advises illegal immigrants who want to sneak into Canada at Niagara Falls to memorize Pizza Pizza 's Toronto number to appear Canadian . Moore cites Pizza Pizza as Canada 's `` national pizza chain '' when at the time of publishing they did not have any locations outside of eastern Canada . `` Pizza ! Pizza ! '' is also recognized , primarily in the United States , as the slogan for another pizza franchise , Little Caesars . The companies are not affiliated and in fact compete in many areas of Canada . Little Caesars has been prohibited from using it as a slogan in Canada , as part of Pizza Pizza 's court defense of the trademark and the great possibility of confusion between the two firms . Pizza Pizza sold its `` Pizza Pizza '' slogan to Little Caesar 's in 1979 . Pizza Pizza 's canned Coca-Cola products have a Gold top instead of the more conventional Silver top . A training center for franchisees is located in south Etobicoke . Michael Overs died on the morning of March 31 , 2010 . His son-in-law , Paul Goddard , was appointed CEO .

The Red-crowned Crane ( Grus japonensis ) , also called the Japanese Crane or Manchurian Crane , is a large crane and is the second rarest crane in the world . ( ; ; Hanyu Pinyin : DÄ ndÇ ng HÃ ; , tancho ; the Chinese character ' ä ' means ` red ' , ' é \/ é ' means ` crown ' and ' é \/ é ' means ` crane ' ) . In East Asia , it is known as a symbol of luck , longevity and fidelity . At 140 â `` 150 cm ( 55-60 inches ) high , the crane does not make easy prey , for all that it stands out in its natural habitat of marshes and swamps . When it matures , the Red-crowned Crane is snow white with a patch of red skin on its head . This patch of skin becomes bright red when the crane becomes angry or excited . This species is the heaviest crane , typically 7.7 â `` 10 - kg ( 17-22 lb ) , although large Sarus Cranes are taller . The maximum known weight of a male Red-crowned Crane is 15 kg ( 33 lbs . ) In the spring and summer , the Red-crowned Crane breeds in Siberia and occasionally in northeastern Mongolia ( i.e. , Mongol Daguur Strictly Protected Area ) . Normally the crane lays 2 eggs , with only one surviving . Later , in the fall , it migrates in flocks to Korea , Japan , China , Taiwan , and other countries in East Asia to spend the winter . All Red-crowned Cranes migrate , except for a flock that is resident in HokkaidÅ . The crane eats small amphibians , aquatic invertebrates , insects , and plants that grow in marshes and swamps . The habitats used are marshes , riverbanks , rice fields , and other wet areas . The estimated population of the species is only 1,500 in the wild . Nearly all of the Chinese population lives in the Yancheng Coastal Wetlands . The National Aviary in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania ran a program where U.S. zoos donated eggs which were flown to Russia and raised in the Khinganski Nature Reserve and released into the wild . This program sent 150 eggs between 1995-2005 . The program has been put on hold in order to concentrate on different crane conservation programs in Russia , such as education and fire suppression . ( Red-crowned Crane SSP ) In Japan , this crane is known as the tancho and is said to live for 1,000 years . A pair of Red-crowned Cranes were used in the design for the Series D 1000 yen note . In the Ainu language , the Red-crowned Crane is known as sarurun kamuy or marsh kamuy . In China , the Red-crowned Crane is often featured in myths and legends . In Taoism , the Red-crowned Crane is a symbol of longevity and immortality . In art and literature , immortals are often depicted riding on cranes . A mortal who attains immortality is similarly carried off by a crane . Reflecting this association , Red-crowned Cranes are called xian he ( ä '' é ) , or fairy cranes . The Red-crowned Crane is also a symbol of nobility . Depictions of the crane have been found in Shang Dynasty tombs and Zhou Dynasty ceremonial bronzeware . A common theme in later Chinese art is the reclusive scholar who cultivates bamboo and keeps cranes . Because of its importance in Chinese culture , the Red-crowned Crane was selected by the National Forestry Bureau of the People 's Republic of China as its only candidate for the national animal of China . This decision was deferred because the Red-crowned Crane 's Latin name translates as `` Japanese Crane '' .
Laconia ( ' ) , also known as Lacedaemonia , is one of the peripheral units of Greece . It is part of the periphery of Peloponnese . It is situated in the southeastern part of the Peloponnese peninsula . Its administrative capital is Sparti ( Sparta ) . The word `` laconic '' is derived from the name of the region by analogy - to speak in a concise way , as the Spartans were reputed by the Athenians to do . Laconia borders on Messenia to the west , and Arcadia to the north . Laconia is surrounded by the Myrtoan Sea to the east and the Laconian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea to the south . It encompasses Cape Malea and Cape Tainaron and a large part of the Mani Peninsula . The islands of Kythira and Antikythera lie to the south , but they administratively belong to the peripheral unit of Islands . The island Elafonisos , situated between the Laconian mainland and Kythira , is part of Laconia . The Evrotas is the longest river in the prefecture . The valley of the Evrotas is predominantly an agricultural region that contains many citrus groves , olive groves and pasture lands . It is the location of the largest orange production in the Peloponnese and probably all of Greece . The brand of orange juice named after this prefecture Lakonia is based in Amykles . The main mountain ranges are the Taygetus ( 2,407 m ) in the west and the Parnon ( 1,961 m ) in the northeast . Taygetus , known as Pentadaktylos ( five-fingers ) throughout the Middle Ages , is west of Sparta and the Evrotas valley . It is the highest mountain in Laconia and the Peloponnese , and mostly covered with pine trees . Two roads connect the adjoining prefectures of Messenia and Laconia : one is a tortuous mountain pass through Taygetus and the other bypasses the mountain via the Mani district to the south . The stalactite cave Dirou , a major tourist attraction , is located south of Areopolis in the southwest of Laconia . Laconia has a Mediterranean climate with warm winters and hot summers . Snow is rare on the coast throughout the winter , but very common in the mountains . The peripheral unit Laconia is subdivided into 5 municipalities . These are ( number as in the map in the infobox ) : As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform , the peripheral unit Laconia was created out of the former prefecture Laconia . The prefecture had the same territory as the present peripheral unit . At the same time , the municipalities were reorganised , according to the table below . Note : Provinces no longer hold any legal status in Greece . In ancient Greece this was the principal region of the Spartan state . Throughout classical antiquity the Spartan sphere of influence expanded to Messenia , whose inhabitants ( the helots ) were permanently enslaved . Significant archaeological recovery exists at the Vaphio tomb site in Laconia . Advanced Bronze Age art is found here , and evidence of cultural associations with the co-temperaneous Minoan culture on Crete . Laconia was at war with the Kingdom of Macedonia and saw several battles ; at the end of the Mycenean period population of Laconia declined sharply . From the early-2nd century BC until 395 it became a part of the Roman Empire . In the medieval period it formed part of the Byzantine Empire , and following the Crusades it was the home of the Byzantine Despotate of Morea , held by the penultimate Greek ruling dynasty , the Palaiologoi . Laconia fell into the hands of the Ottomans but the Mani peninsula was mainly autonomous . Laconia was liberated after the Greek War of Independence of 1821 , and after victory in battle , Sparta was selected capital of the modern prefecture ; its economy and agriculture expanded . The country and the prefecture extended beyond the Laconia of ancient times , to Elafonissos in 1864 , separating it from the British Empire and dissolving United States of the Ionian Islands . The island never had full Turkish rule ; it was part of the Venetian Empire from the 15th century until the Napoleonic Wars . After World War II and the Greek Civil War , its population began to decline somewhat , as people moved from the villages toward the larger cities of Greece and abroad . In 1992 , a devastating fire ruined the finest olive crops in the northern part of the prefecture , and affected the area of Sellasia along with Oinountas and its surrounding areas . Firefighters , helicopters and planes battled for days to put out the horrific fire . The Mani portion along with Gytheio became famous in Greece for filming episodes of Vendetta , broadcast on Mega Channel throughout Greece and abroad on Mega Cosmos . Flooding ruined olive and citrus crops along the Evrotas river , as well as properties and villages there in early 2006 . In the summer of 2006 , a terrible fire devastated a part of the Mani Peninsula , ruining tens of its villages and crops , along with its forests .

The Red Bull Arena , formerly Zentralstadion , located in Leipzig , Saxony , Germany , is the premier football facility in the former East Germany . It is the largest football stadium in the former East Germany and has also hosted music concerts as well as football . Various Leipzig football teams have used the stadium as a home stadium , including VfB Leipzig ( pre-cursor to 1 . FC Lokomotive Leipzig ) at various points in the 20th century ( including large-scale European matches in the 1970s and domestic football in the 1990s . FC Sachsen Leipzig used the stadium as a home ground from time to time between 2004 and 2007 , however they moved back to their spiritual home , the Alfred-Kunze-Sportpark at the start of the 2008\/09 season . In July 2009 , energy drink manufacturer Red Bull took over the license of SSV MarkranstÃ dt and renamed the team RasenBallsport Leipzig , in short RB Leipzig . From the outset , the new team outlined their wish to move into the tenant-less Zentralstadion and rename it the `` Red Bull Arena '' . The naming rights were granted on 25 March 2010 and the stadium will be named so for a minimum period of 10 years as of 1 July 2010 . The cost for renting the stadium will rise in accordance with the level of football RasenBallsport Leipzig are at . The team has pledged to upgrade the seating , install video advertising hoardings and make changes to the boxes and the VIP area . For the 2010 â `` 11 season , Hallescher FC will play between three and five games at the Zentralstadion due the their own Kurt-Wabbel Stadion being renovated . The games played at the Zentralstadion will be those likely to pose the biggest security risk , as Hallescher FC will be temporarily moving to the 4,500 capacity NeustÃ dter Stadion during the construction work . These `` high-security '' games will be the matches against 1 . FC Magdeburg , Chemnitzer FC , its home game against RB Leipzig and a possible match against a team relegated from the 3 . Liga . This move was necessary to secure a license from the German Football Association for next season . In 1956 , the first Zentralstadion opened , at the time it was the biggest stadium in Europe being able to hold 100,000 spectators . However , over the years it fell in to disuse and was costing the city too much to maintain . In 1997 , the city of Leipzig decided to build a new stadium within the old stadium , a modern state of the art stadium only for football . The new stadium was built from December 2000 till March 2004 . The Zentralstadion was the only stadium in the former East Germany to host games in the 2006 FIFA World Cup . It hosted four group matches and a round of 16 game in the tournament . A year earlier , it was also one of the venues for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and hosted three matches of the tournament , including the third-place match . Since 2005 , the Zentralstadion is also regular host of the German League Cup final . There are bridges built over the old stadium to connect with the new stadium . The roof has an integrated floodlight design and is designed to provide superior acoustics . The grass area is 120 x 80 m , the actual playing field is 105 x 68 m. It has been integrated into the area surrounding the stadium by large amounts of trees and other greenery . The stadium was one of the venues for the 2006 FIFA World Cup , the only one located in the territory of the former GDR .

Netherwood `` Ned '' Hughes ( 12 June 1900 â `` 4 April 2009 ) was one of the last two Tommies who served the United Kingdom during the First World War , along with Harry Patch , although Patch is the only one to have seen action . Hughes was also one of three British veterans still living in the country , with Patch and Henry Allingham being the other two . The Ministry of Defense has not confirmed his war service , but many First World War service records were destroyed in the Blitz during the Second World War . However the World War I Veterans Association invited him to the Cenotaph for the 90th Anniversary of the Armistice . He did not attend as his family felt that the journey would be too much for him . He was born in Great Harwood , the middle child of seven siblings to John , who worked as an optician , and Robina . He had three brothers : Charlie , Henry , and Sidney , who served in the Royal Navy on HMS Albion . Hughes spent most of his working life as a mechanic and driver and , in June 1918 , he was called up , like every other driver in Great Britain , to perform that role in the British Army . While he was still in training the war ended , and he returned home to drive in a mill . He later became a bus driver . Hughes married twice , but never had any children , although he was frequently visited by his nephews at his care home , Woodlands Home for the Elderly in Clayton-le-Moors , where he spent most of his time in the grounds , smoking his pipe . When receiving a birthday card from the Queen each year since his 100th birthday , he commented : `` She has the same frock on '' . In his final few weeks , Ned 's health deteriorated and he had difficulty speaking for a week before his death , according to his niece , Ann Hutton . He died of natural causes on 4 April 2009 , aged 108 , at Woodlands . Speaking to the Accrington Observer , Mrs Hutton said , `` Itâ s not the familyâ s wishes for a military funeral . We donâ t want bugles and whistles , we just want a simple family affair . He couldnâ t stand any fuss on his birthdays . ''

Amides are also versatile precursors to many other functional groups . Sodium nitrate is the chemical compound with the formula NaNO3 . This salt , also known as Chile saltpeter or Peru saltpeter ( due to the large deposits found in each country ) to distinguish it from ordinary saltpeter , potassium nitrate , is a white solid which is very soluble in water . The mineral form is also known as nitratine or soda niter . Sodium nitrate is used as an ingredient in fertilizers , pyrotechnics , as an ingredient in smoke bombs , as a food preservative , and as a solid rocket propellant , as well as in glass and pottery enamels . The compound has been mined extensively for those purposes . The first shipment of Chile saltpeter to Europe arrived in England in 1820 or 1825 , but did not find any buyers and was dumped at sea in order to avoid customs toll . With time , however , the mining of South American saltpeter became a profitable business ( in 1859 , England alone consumed 47,000 metric tons ) . Chile fought against the allies Peru and Bolivia in the War of the Pacific 1879-1884 and took over the richest deposits . In 1919 , Ralph Walter Graystone Wyckoff determined its crystal structure using X-ray crystallography . The largest accumulations of naturally occurring sodium nitrate are found in Chile and Peru , where nitrate salts are bound within mineral deposits called caliche ore. . For more than a century , the world supply of the compound was mined almost exclusively from the Atacama desert in northern Chile until , at the turn of the 20th century , German chemists Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch developed a process for producing ammonia from the atmosphere on an industrial scale ( see Haber process ) . With the onset of World War I , Germany began converting ammonia from this process into a synthetic Chilean saltpeter which was as practical as the natural compound in production of gunpowder and other munitions . By the 1940s , this conversion process resulted in a dramatic decline in demand for sodium nitrate procured from natural sources . Chile still has the largest reserves of caliche , with active mines in such locations as Pedro de Valdivia , MarÃ a Elena and Pampa Blanca , and there it used to be called white gold . Sodium nitrate , potassium nitrate , sodium sulfate and iodine are all obtained by the processing of caliche . The former Chilean saltpeter mining communities of Humberstone and Santa Laura were declared Unesco World Heritage sites in 2005 . Sodium nitrate is also synthesized industrially by neutralizing nitric acid with soda ash . Sodium nitrate was used extensively as a fertilizer and a raw material for the manufacture of gunpowder in the late 19th century . It can be combined with iron hydroxide to make a resin . Sodium nitrate should not be confused with the related compound , sodium nitrite . It can be used in the production of nitric acid by combining it with sulfuric acid and subsequent separation through fractional distillation of the nitric acid , leaving behind a residue of sodium bisulfate . Hobbyist gold refiners use sodium nitrate to make a hybrid aqua regia that dissolves gold and other metals . Less common applications include its use as a substitute oxidizer used in fireworks as a replacement for potassium nitrate commonly found in black powder and as a component in instant cold packs . Sodium nitrate is used together with potassium nitrate for heat storage and , more recently , for heat transfer in solar power plants . It is also used in the wastewater industry for facultative microorganism respiration . Nitrosomonas , a genus of microorganisms , consumes nitrate in preference to oxygen , enabling it to grow more rapidly in the wastewater to be treated . Like sodium nitrite , sodium nitrate forms nitrosamines , a human carcinogen , known to cause DNA damage and increased cellular degeneration . Studies have shown a link between increased levels of nitrates and increased deaths from certain diseases including Alzheimer 's , diabetes mellitus and Parkinson 's , possibly through the damaging effect of nitrosamines on DNA . Nitrosamines , formed in cured meats containing sodium nitrate and nitrite , have been linked to gastric cancer and oesophageal cancer . Sodium nitrate and nitrite are associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer . World Cancer Research Fund UK , states that one of the reasons that processed meat increases the risk of colon cancer is its content of nitrate . A small amount of the nitrate added to meat as a preservative breaks down into nitrite , in addition to any nitrite that may also be added . The nitrite then reacts with protein-rich foods ( such as meat ) to produce N-nitroso compounds ( NOCs ) . Some types of NOCs are known to cause cancer .
In nutrition , polyunsaturated fat , or polyunsaturated fatty acid , are fatty acids in which more than one double bond exists within the representative molecule . That is , the molecule has two or more points on its structure capable of supporting hydrogen atoms not currently part of the structure . Polyunsaturated fatty acids can assume a cis or trans conformation depending on the geometry of the double bond . The lack of the extra hydrogen atoms on the molecule 's surface typically reduces the strength of the compound 's intermolecular forces , thus causing the melting point of the compound to be significantly lower . This property can be observed by comparing predominately unsaturated vegetable oils , which remain liquid even at relatively low temperatures , to much more saturated fats such as butter or lard which are mainly solid at room temperature . Trans fats are more similar to saturated fat than are cis fats in many respects , including the fact that they solidify at a higher temperature than cis fats . A fatty acid has a carboxylic acid at one end and a methyl group at the other end . Carbon atoms in a fatty acid are identified by Greek letters on the basis of their distance from the carboxylic acid . The carbon atom closest to the carboxylic acid is the alpha carbon , the next adjacent carbon is the beta carbon , etc. . In a long-chain fatty acid the carbon atom in the methyl group is called the omega carbon because omega is the last letter of the Greek alphabet . Omega-3 fatty acids have a double bond three carbons away from the methyl carbon , whereas omega-6 fatty acids have a double bond six carbons away from the methyl carbon . The illustration below shows the omega-6 fatty acid , linoleic acid . Polyunsaturated fat can be found mostly in nuts , seeds , fish , algae , leafy greens , and krill . Whole food sources are always best , as processing and heating may damage polyunsaturated fats . Omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil , fish and seafood have been shown to lower the risk of heart attacks . Omega-6 fatty acids in sunflower oil and safflower oil may also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease . Consumption of refined sugar and refined grain products also cause the body to metabolize omega-6 fats into pro-inflammatory prostaglandins . Omega-3 fatty acids reduced prostate tumor growth , slowed histopathological progression , and increased survival . Among n-3 fatty acids ( Omega-3 ) , neither long-chain nor short-chain forms were consistently associated with breast cancer risk . High levels of docosahexaenoic acid , however , the most abundant n-3 PUFA ( Omega-3 ) in erythrocyte membranes , were associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer . Dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids has been shown in several studies to decrease the risk of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS , a.k.a. Lou Gehrig 's Disease ) . At least one study in mice has shown that consuming high amounts of polyunsaturated fat ( but not monounsaturated fat ) may increase the risk of metastasis in cancer patients . . The researchers found that linoleic acid in polyunsaturated fats produced increasing membrane phase separation , and thereby increased adherence of circulating tumor cells to blood vessel walls and remote organs . According to the report ` The new findings support earlier evidence from other research that consuming high amounts of polyunsaturated fat may increase the risk of cancer spreading ' . The propensity for polyunsaturated fats to oxidize is another possible risk factor . This leads to the generation of free radicals and eventually to rancidity . Studies have shown that low dosages of Coenzyme Q10 reduce this oxidation , and a combination of a diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and Coenzyme Q10 supplementation leads to a longer lifespan in rats . Studies on animals have shown a link between polyunsaturated fat and the incidence of tumors . In some of these studies the incidence of tumors increased with increasing intake of polyunsaturated fat , up to about 5 % of total energy , near to the middle of the current dietary intake in humans . However , studies in humans have found little evidence of an association between polyunsaturated fat and the risk of cancer . It is advised that the level of polyunsaturated fats in the diet be regulated if Coenzyme Q10 supplements are not being taken . However , even without Coenzyme Q10 supplementation , the effect on health might be more beneficial than harmful in terms of its effect on reducing cholesterol levels .

The British Rail Class 109 is a class of 2-car diesel multiple units built in 1957 by D Wickham & Co. . Five two-car units were built featuring an unusual body design . The units soon became non-standard and two were sold back to the manufacturer who exported them to Trinidad and Tobago . Another unit was converted into departmental service , and survived in BR ownership until the early 1980s . One two-car set ( 50416 +56171 ) was extensively overhauled in 1967 at Doncaster , revamping the interiors and adding kitchen facilities added to 50416 . After repainting , the set was used as the ER General Managers special train , numbered 975005 \/ 975006 . One two-car unit , ( see above ) the former departmental unit , formed of vehicles 50416 and 56171 , has been preserved and restored to working condition at the Llangollen Railway . It was restored using lottery money .
The 1916 Stanley Cup Final was played between the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) champion Montreal Canadiens and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) champion Portland Rosebuds . This was the first time that a best-of-five Cup championship went the distance . Also , the Rosebuds were the first team based in the United States to play for the Cup . The Canadiens defeated the Rosebuds three games to two in the best-of-five game series . Montreal won the NHA title after finishing the 1915 â `` 16 regular season in first place with a 16 â `` 7 â `` 1 record . Meanwhile , Portland clinched the 1915 â `` 16 PCHA title with a 13 â `` 5 record . The games of the series were played at Montreal 's Montreal Arena as it was the turn of the NHA champions to host the series . This was not the home rink of the Canadiens , but it was larger than their home Jubilee Rink . Games one , three and five were played under NHA rules ; Games two and four were played under PCHA rules . Ernie Johnson 's share of series revenues was by court order to be paid to the Montreal Wanderers , who he had left while under contract to go to the PCHA . For the entire series , future Hockey Hall of Fame goaltender Georges Vezina aided Montreal by posting a 2.60 goals-against average . Didier Pitre led the Canadiens in scoring with 4 goals . Portland arrived by train the day before the game but showed no weariness , recording a shutout . Despite missing Newsy Lalonde and Jack Laviolette , Montreal behind some heavy checking defeated Portland 2 â `` 1 to tie the series . Lalonde and Laviolette played in game three . Lalonde got into a fight with Ernie Johnson , requiring the police to break up the fight . Lalonde and Laviolette were ejected for the game and Eddie Oatman received a major penalty . Pitre was the scoring star , scoring three goals to lead the Canadiens to a 6 â `` 3 victory . The Rosebuds then evened the series with a 6 â `` 5 victory in game four . The Rosebuds took a 3 â `` 0 lead , only to see the Canadiens tie it and take a 4 â `` 3 lead . In the third period Portland 's Fred Harris scored twice and Charlie Uksilla scored once to take a 6 â `` 4 lead until the last minute when Lalonde scored to make it closer . In game five , Portland 's Tommy Dunderdale gave his team a 1 â `` 0 lead before Skene Ronan tied the game . The seldom-used George Prodger then scored the game and series-winning goal to clinch the Cup for the Canadiens .

The Myrtales are an order of flowering plants placed as a basal group within the rosid group of dicotyledons ( not a member of eurosids I or eurosids II ) . The following families are typical of newer classifications : The Cronquist system gives essentially the same composition , except the Vochysiaceae are removed to the order Polygalales , and the Thymelaeaceae are included . The families Sonneratiaceae , Trapaceae , and Punicaceae are removed from the Lythraceae , while the Psioxylaceae and Heteropyxidaceae are treated within the Myrtaceae , and the Memecyclaceae within the Melastomataceae .
She then became Lady Mary Carey when her father was granted the titles of Earl of Ormond and Earl of Wiltshire . A cubic centimetre ( or cubic centimeter in US English ) ( symbol cm3 â '' the abbreviations cc and ccm , though widely used , are deprecated ) is a commonly used unit of volume extending the derived SI-unit cubic metre , and corresponds to the volume of a cube measuring 1 cm Ã -- 1 cm Ã -- 1 cm . One cubic centimetre corresponds to a volume of of a cubic metre , or of a litre , or one millilitre ; thus , 1 cm3 â 1 mL . The mass of one cubic centimetre of water at 3.98 Â C ( the temperature at which it attains its maximal density ) is roughly equal to one gram . In many scientific fields , the use of cubic centimetres has been replaced by the millilitre . The medical and automotive fields are two of the few fields wherein the term cubic centimetre was never discontinued in the United States . Much of the automotive industry outside the U.S. has switched to using litres instead of cubic centimetres . In the United Kingdom , millilitres are used in preference to cubic centimetres in the medical field , but not the automotive . Most other English-speaking countries follow the UK example , but the use of cubic centimetres persists everywhere , especially in the automotive field . There is currently a movement within the medical field to discontinue the use of cc in prescriptions and on medical documents as it can be mis-read as `` 00 '' ; this could result in a hundredfold overdose of medication , which may be dangerous or even lethal . In the United States , such confusion accounts for 12.6 % of all errors associated with medical abbreviations . In automobile engines , `` cc '' refers to the total volume of its engine displacement in cubic centimetres .

Federico Balzaretti ( born 6 December 1981 in Turin , Piedmont ) is an Italian footballer who currently plays as a left back for Serie A club Palermo . Known as ` Balzac ' by most fans , he grew up since the age of 6 in the Torino youth system , debuting for the granata in season 2002 â `` 03 . After a couple of seasons on loan to Varese and Siena , ` Balzac ' was heavily involved in the 2004 â `` 05 Serie B campaign of Torino , which brought the team to a Serie A promotion . However , as Torino disbanded right after that promotion , ` Balzac ' was released in a free transfer , and was signed by city arch-rivals Juventus . In 2005 â `` 06 he was part of the first team for the bianconeri , often playing as regular under orders of coach Fabio Capello , and finally winning the Serie A league . ` Balzac 's ' first ever senior goal game on 17 February 2007 , in Serie B , as Juventus beat Crotone 5 â `` 0 . He was sold to Fiorentina on July 2007 , but failed to impress with the viola as he made only six appearances in the first half of the Serie A 2007-08 , and was subsequently signed by Palermo in a permanent move during the January transfer market . At Palermo , he took the # 42 jersey as a homage to his father , who was born in 1942 ; in his tenure with the Sicilian side , he immediately established himself as a mainstay , playing regularly for the rosanero also in the following seasons and establishing as one of the most praised Italian left backs . After playing with a number of youth selections between 2000 and 2002 , Balzaretti received his first senior call-up in November 2010 from Italy national football team coach Cesare Prandelli ( and a former boss of him while at Fiorentina ) and made his debut in a friendly match against Romania . Balzaretti is engaged to renowned Italian ballerina Eleonora Abbagnato ; their wedding is to take place in spring of 2011 in Palermo .
Anna Stepanovna Demidova ( 1878 - July 17 , 1918 ) was a maid in the service of Tsarina Alexandra of Russia . She acquired posthumous fame due to the fact that she was murdered alongside her employer in 1918 . She shared the Romanov family 's exile at Tobolsk and Ekaterinburg following the Russian Revolution of 1917 and was murdered with them on July 17 , 1918 . Like them , she was canonized as a martyr by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia in 1981 as a victim of Soviet oppression . Demidova , whose nickname was `` Nyuta , '' was described as a `` tall , statuesque blonde . '' She was the daughter of Stepan Demidov , a well-off merchant from Cherepovets . Demidova graduated from the Yaroslavl Institute for Maids with a teaching certificate . She was a good friend of Elizaveta Ersberg , a parlormaid at the court , and was once engaged to Ersberg 's brother Nikolai . In 1900 Ersberg secured her friend a position at the court . During her service at the Romanov court as a chambermaid , Demidova became smitten with the Romanov children 's English tutor Charles Sydney Gibbes . In his memoirs , Gibbes described Demidova as `` of a singularly timid and shrinking disposition . '' Demidova accompanied Tsarina Alexandra , Tsar Nicholas II , and Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia when they were transferred to Ekaterinburg from Tobolsk in April 1918 . The remaining Romanov children and other members of the group stayed behind in Tobolsk for a month because the Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia was ill. . As the group left , Demidova told Gibbes , `` I am so frightened of the Bolsheviks , Mr. Gibbes . I do n't know what they will do to us . '' On the night of the murder , the family was awakened and told to dress . Demidova carried two pillows into which gems had been sewed . After the first volley of fire by the killers , Demidova , who had fainted after being wounded , revived and , finding herself still alive , exclaimed `` Thank God ! God has saved me ! '' Hearing her , the assassins turned on her . Screaming and crying , she attempted to defend herself , but was eventually stabbed to death with bayonets . Demidova 's great-niece , Natalie Demidova , attended the funeral held on July 17 , 1998 in Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg for Demidova , the Romanov family , and other victims killed by the Bolsheviks eighty years earlier .
On April 4 2009 Pelak has had ended his contract with FK Zeljeznicar and has signed new contract with FK Olimpik Sarajevo that is currently playing in Premier League . Milan `` Miki '' RapaiÄ ( born 16 August 1973 in Nova GradiÅ ka ) is a Croatian football ( soccer ) midfielder who is currently player of NK Trogir after his contract with Standard LiÃ ge ended in July 2007 . Previously , RapaiÄ played for Hajduk Split ( 1991 â `` 1996 , 2002 â `` 2003 ) , Perugia ( 1996 â `` 2000 ) , FenerbahÃ e ( 2000 â `` 2002 ) , and Ancona ( 2003 â `` 2004 ) . A regular in the Croatia national football team , he had earned 45 caps and scored five goals as of the end of 2004 . RapaiÄ played two games for his country at the 2002 FIFA World Cup . He will be most remembered for his spectacular if somewhat lucky winning goal scored against Italy . He also played three games for Croatia in Euro 2004 and scored one goal . He has proved a fan favorite wherever he has played , and after impressive performances he once again earned a call up for the Croatian national side after missing the 2006 FIFA World Cup . Croatia went on to beat the world champions Italy ( 0-2 , in August 2006 ) with RapaiÄ playing a large role .
The Mercalli intensity scale is a scale used for measuring the intensity of an earthquake . The scale quantifies the effects of an earthquake on the Earth 's surface , humans , objects of nature , and man-made structures on a scale of I through XII , with I denoting not felt , and XII total destruction . The values will differ based on the distance to the earthquake , with the highest intensities being around the epicentral area . Data is gathered from individuals who have experienced the quake , and an intensity value will be given to their location . The Mercalli ( Intensity ) scale originated with the widely used simple ten-degree Rossi-Forel scale , which was revised by Italian vulcanologist Giuseppe Mercalli in 1884 and 1906 . In 1902 the ten-degree Mercalli scale was expanded to twelve degrees by Italian physicist Adolfo Cancani . It was later completely re-written by the German geophysicist August Heinrich Sieberg and became known as the Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg ( MCS ) scale . The Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg scale was later modified and published in English by Harry O. Wood and Frank Neumann in 1931 as the Mercalli-Wood-Neumann ( MWN ) scale . It was later improved by Charles Richter , the father of the Richter magnitude scale . The scale is known today as the Modified Mercalli scale or Modified Mercalli Intensity scale , and abbreviated MM or MMI . The lower degrees of the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale generally deal with the manner in which the earthquake is felt by people . The higher numbers of the scale are based on observed structural damage . The small table is a rough guide to the degrees of the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale . The colors and descriptive names shown here differ from those used on certain shake maps in other articles . The large table gives Modified Mercalli scale intensities that are typically observed at locations near the epicenter of the earthquake . The Mercalli scale is not defined in terms of more rigorous , objectively quantifiable measurements such as shake amplitude , shake frequency , peak velocity , or peak acceleration . Human perceived shakings and building damages are best correlated with peak acceleration for lower-intensity events , and with peak velocity for higher-intensity events . The effects of any one earthquake can vary greatly from place to place , so there may be many Mercalli intensity values measured for the same earthquake . These values can be best displayed using a contoured map . Each earthquake , on the other hand , has only one magnitude .
Project AWARE is a non-profit , worldwide , organization dedicated to `` Conserving underwater environments through education , advocacy and action . '' The foundation was established in 1995 by PADI ( the Professional Association of Diving Instructors ) in response to growing concerns by some scuba divers about potential harm inflicted on coral reefs by recreational and commercial water activities . Man 's activities and natural disasters have led to a reductions in our natural reef systems Project AWARE have sponsored many regular events such as beach and reef cleaning , coral monitoring and Donate as You Dive campaigns . They continue to monitor and report on the state of the marine environment and lobby governments for greater action on preservation and conservation efforts .

It is one of his greatest and amongst his most popular songs . The single reached number two in the UK , number seven in the US and number one in Australia . The song was praised by critics upon its release , and has given Adams one of his best chart performances to date , his most highly successful being the 1991 international chart-topping hit '' ( Everything I Do ) I Do It For You '' . The song helped So Far So Good reach no. 1 on the UK Albums Chart . The music video for this song also received a huge amount of TV airplay . The song was written and produced by Mutt Lange . It was a massive radio hit all over the world , and became an instant hit amongst Adams fans . The single has sold over 3 million copies worldwide . The music video is filmed in a recording studio and features Adams , his band and a dog . Adams and his bandmates befriended the dog - who belonged to the studio owner - whilst recording the track . The video for Bryan 's 2008 single I Thought I 'd Seen Everything resembles this one .
In philosophy , identity , from ( â samenessâ ) , is the exact sameness of things . According to Leibniz 's law two things sharing every attribute are not only similar , but are the same thing . The concept of sameness has given rise to the general concept of identity , as in personal identity and social identity . An entity can only be fully identical with itself . Any difference gives rise to a separate identity . Thus identity is whatever makes an entity definable and recognizable , in terms of possessing a set of qualities or characteristics that distinguish it from other entities . In layman 's terms , identity is whatever makes something the same or different . In logic , the identity relation ( also called `` equality '' ) is normally defined as the binary relation that holds only between a thing and itself . That is , identity is the two-place predicate , '' = '' , such that for all x and y , `` x = y '' is true if x is the same thing as y. Identity is transitive , symmetric , and reflexive . It is an axiom of most normal modal logics that for all x and y , if x = y then necessarily y = x. That is , identity does not hold contingently , but of necessity . The Law of identity originates from classical antiquity . The modern formulation of identity is that of Gottfried Leibniz , who held that x is the same as y if and only if every predicate true of x is true of y as well . Leibniz 's ideas have taken root in the philosophy of mathematics , where they have influenced the development of the predicate calculus as Leibniz 's law . Mathematicians sometimes distinguish identity from equality . More mundanely , an identity in mathematics may be an equation that holds true for all values of a variable . Hegel argued that things are inherently self-contradictory and that the notion of something being self-identical only made sense if it were not also not-identical or different from itself and did not also imply the latter . In Hegel 's words , `` Identity is the identity of identity and non-identity . '' More recent metaphysicians have discussed trans-world identity -- the notion that there can be the same object in different possible worlds . An alternative to trans-world identity is the counterpart relation in Counterpart theory . It is a similarity relation that rejects trans-world individuals and instead defends an objects counterpart - the most similar object . Arbitrary objects a and b can be said to be qualitatively identical if a and b are duplicates , that is , if a and b are exactly similar in all respects , that is , if a and b have all qualitative properties in common . Examples of this might be two wine glasses made in the same wine glass factory on the same production line ( at least , for a relaxed standard of exact similarity ) , or a carbon atom in one 's left hand and a carbon atom in one 's right shoulder . Alternatively , a and b can be said to be numerically identical if a and b are one and the same thing , that is , if a is b , that is , if there is only one thing variously called `` a '' and `` b '' . For example , Clark Kent is numerically identical with Superman in the sense that there is only one person ( who happens to wear different clothes at different times ) . This relationship is expressed in mathematics with the '' = '' symbol , e.g. , a = b , or Clark Kent = Superman .

Geneva is settled on the junction of the Choctawhatchee River and Pea River . The Choctawhatchee River runs all the way to the Choctawhatchee Bay at Freeport , Florida , which flows into the Gulf of Mexico . Because of this , Geneva was a busy trading center for steam-powered riverboats in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Geneva is often compared by locals to New Orleans , Louisiana because , like New Orleans , parts of the town are near or below sea level and a levee is built around the town . The levee protects the town from being flooded by the two rivers . Every year in April , Geneva holds a River Festival , which brings in hundreds of people from all over the country to the small town . The River Festival is held on the junction of the two rivers , and has many competitive events , such as a five-mile ( 8 km ) road race , greasy pole climb , canoe race , and tug-of-war . The Festival concludes with a concert , usually country music . Though a rather small town in terms of population , throughout the years Geneva has attracted big stars to play , such as Ronnie Milsap , Randy Travis , George Jones , and Aaron Tippin . Geneva has the James A. Mulkey Elementary School , Geneva Middle School , and Geneva High School located within its city limits . In late December 1862 the Union steamship USS Bloomer was in port on the Choctawhatchee River in Geneva . She was captured by a group of Union troops from the 91st New York Volunteers led by E.D. Bruner . The Bloomer was then taken to Pensacola , Florida .

70 ( seventy ) is the natural number following 69 and preceding 71 . Its factorization makes it a sphenic number . 70 is a Pell number and a generalized heptagonal number , one of only two numbers to be both . Also , it is the seventh pentagonal number and the fourth 13-gonal number , as well as the fifth pentatope number . It is the smallest weird number . Since it is possible to find sequences of 70 consecutive integers such that each inner member shares a factor with either the first or the last member , 70 is an ErdÅ ` sâ `` Woods number . In base 10 , it is a Harshad number . The French do not have a word for 70 , instead using `` soixante-dix '' ( 60 + 10 ) . Other French-speaking countries such as Belgium , Switzerland , Aosta Valley and Jersey do have a word for it , using `` septante . ''

November is the eleventh month of the year in the Gregorian Calendar and one of four Gregorian months with the length of 30 days . November retained its name ( from the Latin novem meaning `` nine '' ) when January and February were added to the Roman calendar . November is a month of spring in the Southern Hemisphere and autumn in the Northern Hemisphere . Therefore November in the Southern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent of May in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa . November starts on the same day of the week as February in common years , and March every year . November ends on the same day of the week as August every year . In the pagan wheel of the year , November begins at or near Samhain in the northern hemisphere and Beltaine in the southern hemisphere . November is Native American Heritage Month , Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month , COPD Awareness month , National Novel Writing Month , Alzheimer 's Disease Awareness Month , American Diabetes Month , Lung Cancer Awareness Month , National Homeless Youth Awareness Month , Crohn 's & Ulcerative Colitis Awareness Month , National Pomegranate Month in the United States , and the month dedicated to the Holy Souls in Purgatory in the Roman Catholic Church . November is also International Drum Month . It is quite common for some males in Australia ( especially in the city of Melbourne ) and New Zealand to sport a moustache during the month of November . The custom is known as Movember ( Movember being a portmanteau of the words ` Moustache ' and ` November ' ) , a fundraising event for men 's health issues . In the United States , it has recently become known as No-Shave November or Noshember with growing participation from men and women alike to raise awareness of a variety of charities , and men 's health issues , mainly testicular and prostate cancer .

Yone Minagawa ( 4 January 1893 â `` 13 August 2007 ) was a Japanese supercentenarian believed to have been the world 's oldest living person from 29 January 2007 until her death of old age , aged 114 years 221 days . Although the previous holder of the title , Emma Tillman , died on 28 January 2007 around 10:10 PM EST time , it was already well into 29 January in Japan at that time . After her husband died , she raised her five children by selling flowers and vegetables at a coal mine . Minagawa lived alone in the Momochi apartment building in Nishijin Sawara Ward , Fukuoka , near Seinan Gakuin University , until 2005 , when she moved to Keijuen , a special nursing home in her native Akaike . Minagawa enjoyed playing the shamisen . Even at 114 she participated in club activities in a wheelchair and `` danced '' along to music . Minagawa became the oldest living person in Japan when then 114-year-old Ura Koyama died in April 2005 . With the death of 114-year-old American Emma Tillman on 28 January 2007 , Minagawa became the oldest living person in the world . Minagawa was 114 years 25 days at the time ( being the next day in Japan relative to the USA ) . At the time of her ascension , Minagawa was the youngest person to hold this title since Carrie C. White was the same age on December 13 , 1988 , or ( for those who doubt the authenticity of White 's claim ) since Jeanne Calment was 114 years and 25 days old on March 18 , 1989 . Minagawa died on 13 August 2007 at the age of 114 years 221 days . All but one of her children died before her , but she left six grandchildren , twelve great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren . With her death , another 114-year-old , Edna Parker of the United States , became the oldest living person .
Layoff ( in British and American English ) , also called redundancy in the UK , is the temporary suspension or permanent termination of employment of an employee or ( more commonly ) a group of employees for business reasons , such as when certain positions are no longer necessary or when a business slow-down occurs . Originally the term layoff referred exclusively to a temporary interruption in work , as when factory work cyclically falls off . The term however nowadays usually means the permanent elimination of a position , requiring the addition of `` temporary '' to specify the original meaning . Many synonyms such as downsizing exist , most of which are euphemisms and more abstract descriptions of the process , most of which can also be used for more inclusive processes than that of reducing the number of employees . Downsizing is the `` conscious use of permanent personnel reductions in an attempt to improve efficiency and\/or effectiveness '' . Since the 1980s , downsizing has gained strategic legitimacy . Indeed , recent research on downsizing in the U.S. , UK , and Japan suggests that downsizing is being regarded by management as one of the preferred routes to turning around declining organizations , cutting costs , and improving organisational performance , most often as a cost-cutting measure . Euphemisms are often used to `` soften the blow '' in the process of firing and being fired . The term `` layoff '' originally meant a temporary interruption in work ( and usually pay ) . The term became a euphemism for permanent termination of employment and now usually means that , requiring the addition of `` temporary '' to refer to the original meaning . Many other euphemisms have been coined for '' ( permanent ) layoff '' , including `` downsizing '' , `` excess reduction '' , `` rightsizing '' , `` delayering '' , `` smartsizing '' , `` redeployment '' , `` workforce reduction '' , `` workforce optimization '' , `` simplification '' , `` force shaping '' , `` recussion '' , and `` reduction in force '' ( also called `` RIF '' , especially in the government employment sector ) . `` Mass layoff '' implies laying off a large number of workers . `` Attrition '' implies that positions will be eliminated as workers quit or retire . `` Early retirement '' means workers may quit now yet still remain eligible for their retirement benefits later . While `` redundancy '' is a specific legal term in UK labor law , it may be perceived as obfuscation . Firings imply misconduct or failure while layoffs imply economic forces beyond the employer 's control , especially in the face of a recession such as the one that began in the late 2000s . The method of separation may have an effect on a former employee 's ability to collect whatever form of unemployment compensation might be available in their jurisdiction . In many U.S. states , workers who are laid off can file an unemployment claim and receive compensation . Depending on local or state laws , workers who leave voluntarily are generally ineligible to collect unemployment benefits , as are those who are fired for gross misconduct . Also , lay-offs due to a firm 's moving production overseas may entitle one to increased re-training benefits . Certain countries ( e.g. France and Germany ) , distinguish between leaving the company of one 's own free will , in which case the person is n't entitled to unemployment benefits and leaving a company voluntarily as part of a reduction in labor force size , in which case the person is entitled to them . An RIF reduces the number of positions , rather than laying off specific people , and is usually accompanied by internal redeployment . A person might leave even if their job is n't reduced , unless the employer has strong objections . In this situation , it 's more beneficial for the state to facilitate the departure of the more professionally active people , since they are less likely to remain jobless . Often they find new jobs while still being paid by their old companies , costing nothing to the social security system in the end . There have also been increasing concerns about the organisational effectiveness of the post-downsized â anorexic organisationâ . The benefits , which organizations claim to be seeking from downsizing , center on savings in labor costs , speedier decision making , better communication , reduced product development time , enhanced involvement of employees and greater responsiveness to customers ( De Meuse et al . 1997 , p. 168 ) . However , some writers draw attention to the â obsessiveâ pursuit of downsizing to the point of self-starvation marked by excessive cost cutting , organ failure and an extreme pathological fear of becoming inefficient . Hence â trimmingâ and â tightening beltsâ are the order of the day ( Tyler and Wilkinson 2007 ) Downsizing has come to mean much more than job losses , as the word downsize may now be applied to almost everything . People describe downsizing their cars , houses and nearly anything else that can be measured or valued . This has also spawned the opposite term upsize , which means to grow , expand or purchase something larger .

The United States Department of Education , also referred to as ED or the ED for ( the ) Education Department , is a Cabinet-level department of the United States government . Created by the Department of Education Organization Act ( Public Law 96-88 ) and signed into law by President Jimmy Carter on October 17 , 1979 , it began operating on May 16 , 1980 . The Department of Education Organization Act divided the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare into the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services . The Department of Education is administered by the United States Secretary of Education . It is by far the smallest Cabinet-level department , with about 5,000 employees . The agency 's official acronym is ED ( and not DOE , which refers to the United States Department of Energy ) . It is also often abbreviated informally as DoED . A previous Department of Education was created in 1867 but soon was demoted to an Office in 1868 . As an agency not represented in the president 's cabinet , it quickly became a relatively minor bureau in the Department of the Interior . In 1939 , the bureau was transferred to the Federal Security Agency , where it was renamed the Office of Education . In 1953 , the Federal Security Agency was upgraded to cabinet-level status as the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare . Upgrading Education to cabinet level status a century later in 1979 was controversial and opposed by many in the Republican Party , who saw the department as unconstitutional , arguing that the Constitution does n't mention education , and deemed it an unnecessary and illegal federal bureaucratic intrusion into local affairs . However many liberals and Democrats see the department as constitutional under the Commerce Clause , and that the funding role of the Department is constitutional under the Taxing and Spending Clause . On March 23 , 2007 , President George W. Bush signed into law H.R. 584 , which designates the ED Headquarters building as the Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building . The primary functions of the Department of Education are to `` establish policy for , administer and coordinate most federal assistance to education , collect data on US schools , and to enforce federal educational laws regarding privacy and civil rights . The Department of Education does not establish schools and colleges Unlike the systems of most other countries , education in the United States is highly decentralized , and the federal government and Department of Education are not heavily involved in determining curricula or educational standards ( with the recent exception of the No Child Left Behind Act ) . This has been left to state and local school districts . The quality of educational institutions and their degrees is maintained through an informal private process known as accreditation , over which the Department of Education has no direct public jurisdictional control . The Department 's mission is : to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access . Opposition to the Department of Education mainly stems from conservatives , who see the department as an undermining of states rights , and libertarians who believe it gives government too much power . President Ronald Reagan promised during the 1980 presidential election to eliminate the Department of Education as a cabinet post , but he was not able to do so with a Democratic House of Representatives . In the 1982 State of the Union Address , he pledged : Throughout the 1980s , the abolition of the Department of Education was a part of the Republican Party platform , but the administration of President George H. W. Bush declined to implement this idea , as he was in favor of its existence , but rather reformed its activities . In 1996 , the Republican Party made abolition of the Department a cornerstone of their campaign promises , calling it an inappropriate federal intrusion into local , state , and family affairs . The GOP platform read : During his 1996 presidential run , Senator Bob Dole promised , `` We 're going to cut out the Department of Education . '' In 2000 , the Republican Liberty Caucus passed a resolution to abolish the Department of Education . Abolition of the organization was not pursued under the George W. Bush administration ( as he too like his father was in favor of its existence ) which made reform of federal education a key priority of the President 's first term . In 2008 , presidential candidate Ron Paul campaigned in part on an opposition to the Department . Under President George W. Bush , the Department primarily focused on elementary and secondary education , expanding its reach through the `` No Child Left Behind '' law . The Department 's budget increased by $ 14B between 2002 and 2004 , from $ 46B to $ 60B . As with other federal agencies , the ED operates with the assistance of several advisory committees . The Federal Interagency Committee on Education ( FICE ) is known in higher education for originating the FICE code , the six-digit institutional identifier assigned to each higher education ( two-year and above ) institution . The FICE code is a six-digit identification code that was used to identify all schools doing business with the Office of Education during the early sixties . This code is no longer used in IPEDS ; it has been replaced by the Office of Postsecondary Education ( OPE ) ID code . For 2006 , the ED discretionary budget was $ 56 billion and the mandatory budget contained $ 23.4 billion . As of 2011 , the budget is $ 69.9 billion .
Maple Ridge also has several large festivals and parades occurring yearly , including the Rogers Santa Clause Parade , the Jazz and Blues Festival , and the Caribbean Festival . Club AtlÃ tico Belgrano ( mostly known simply as Belgrano or Belgrano de CÃ rdoba ) is a sport club from CÃ rdoba , Argentina , best known for its football team , currently playing in the second division . The football team is very popular and it has one of the largest fan bases outside Buenos Aires . The club also has 10,000 members ( season ticket holders ) and last season had an average attendance of 32,000 fans . Belgrano was founded in 1905 by a group of teenagers , having 14-year-old Arturo Orgaz as its first president . They named it in commemoration of the Argentine historical figure General Manuel Belgrano , and its colors were taken from the flag of Argentina , created by Belgrano himself . The team started playing in the second division of the CÃ rdoba league in 1908 , winning that championship and the following two , to reach the first division of the local league . Because their precarious field did n't comply with the first division requirements , Belgrano 's fans and players used to borrow post , wire and fences from the nearby houses to erect the required protections . Nevertheless , they would return all the material to their owners , leaving things as they were before the match . This kind of borrowing without consent brought them the nickname of Piratas ( `` Pirates '' ) . After the foundation of the FederaciÃ n Cordobesa de FÃ tbol ( `` CÃ rdoba Football Association '' ) , Belgrano won the first championship of 1913 . The following season gave birth to the CÃ rdoba Derby between Belgrano and Talleres . The first round of the league faced both teams , but that first derby match would only last 4 minutes , for Talleres left the field after a doubtful goal given to Belgrano . On March 17 of 1929 , the grounds of the Gigante de Alberdi were finished , one of the first cement stadiums in Argentina . El Gigante would be later renovated in 1997 to meet the requirements of the first and second national divisions . Within the CÃ rdoba league , Belgrano won all the championships between 1929 and 1937 , except for 1934 , that was won by Talleres . Then , it won the 1940 , 1946 , 1947 , 1950 , 1952 , 1954 , 1955 , 1956 ( UniÃ n Cordobesa de FÃ tbol ) and 1957 . Belgrano was able to play its way to the Nacional tournament of 1968 , and reached the Argentine second division in 1986 . The club finally reached first division in 1992 , where it played until 1996 . In 1998 the team was promoted again to first division , to be relegated after the 2001\/02 season . Beating Olimpo de BahÃ a Blanca at the 2005-06 PromociÃ n , Belgrano returned to first division for the 2006-07 season . Belgrano were relegated to the second division after narrowly missing out on a Promotion play-off berth .

The Qinling Mountains are a major east-west mountain range in southern Shaanxi province , China . The mountains provide a natural boundary between the North and South of the country , and support a huge variety of plant and wildlife , some of which is found nowhere else on Earth . To the north is the densely populated Wei River valley , an ancient center of Chinese civilization . To the south is the Han River valley . To the west is the line of mountains along the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau . To the east are the lower Funiu Shan and Dabie Shan which rise out of the coastal plain . The Northern side of the range is prone to hot weather , however the physical barrier of the mountains mean that the land to the North enjoys a semi-arid climate , with the lack of rich , fertile landscape can not support a wealth of wildlife . The mountains also acted as a natural defense against nomadic invasions from the North , as only four passes cross the mountains . In the late 1990s a railway tunnel and a spiral was completed , thereby easing travel across the range . The highest mountain in the range is Mount Taibai ( å ç 1\/2 å ) at 3767 m , which is about 100 k West of the ancient Chinese capital of Xi ` an and is the highest mountain in eastern China . Mount Hua ( å å ) ( 2155 m ) , Mount Li ( é å \/ é å ) ( 1302 m ) , and Mount Maiji ( é ç å ) ( 1742 m ) make up the three other significant peaks in the range . The environment of the Qinling Mountains is that of the Qin Ling Mountains deciduous forests ecoregion . The region is home to a large number of rare plants , of which around 3,000 have so far been documented . Plant and tree species native to the region include Ginkgo , thought to be one of the oldest species of tree in the world , as well as Huashan or Armand Pine , Acer miaotaiense and Chinese Fir . Timber harvesting reached a peak in the 18th century in the Qinling Mountains . They are home to the Qinling pandas , a sub-species of the giant panda , which are protected in the region with the help of the Changqing and Foping nature reserves . Around 200 giant pandas live in the region , estimated at around a fifth of the entire wild giant panda population . The mountains are also home to the Golden Takin ( a species of Ox ) , Golden Pheasant , Golden Snub-nosed Monkey , Temminck 's Tragopan , Crested Ibis , Golden Eagle , and Clouded Leopard .

The 3rd century is the period from 200 to 299 in accordance with the Julian calendar in the Christian\/Common Era . In this century , the Roman Empire sees a crisis , marking the beginning of Late Antiquity . In Persia , the Parthian Empire is succeeded by the Sassanid Empire . In India , the Kushan Empire is replaced by the Gupta Empire . China is in the Three Kingdoms period . The Xiongnu form the Tiefu state under Liu Qubei . Korea is ruled by the Three Kingdoms of Korea . Japan enters the Kofun period . In Sub-Saharan Africa , the Bantu expansion reaches Southern Africa . In Pre-Columbian America , the Adena culture of the Ohio River valley declines in favor of the Hopewell culture . The Maya civilization enters its Classic Era . After the death of Commodus in the previous century the Roman Empire was plunged into a civil war . When the dust settled , Septimius Severus emerged as emperor , establishing the Severan dynasty . Unlike previous emperors , he openly used the army to back his authority , and paid them well to do so . The regime he created is known as the Military Monarchy as a result . The system fell apart in the 230s , giving way to a fifty-year period known as the Military Anarchy or the Crisis of the Third Century , where no fewer than twenty emperors held the reins of power , most for only a few months . The majority of these men were assassinated , or killed in battle , and the empire almost collapsed under the weight of the political upheaval , as well as the growing Persian threat in the east . Under its new Sassanid rulers , Persia had grown into a rival superpower , and the Romans would have to make drastic reforms in order to better prepare their state for a confrontation . These reforms were finally realized late in the century under the reign of Diocletian , one of them being to divide the empire into an eastern and western half , and have a separate ruler for each .
From `` Small is Beautiful '' , Harper and Row , New York , New York , 1989 , p33 . Skates are cartilaginous fish belonging to the family Rajidae in the superorder Batoidea of rays . There are more than 200 described species in 27 genera . There are two subfamilies , Rajinae ( hardnose skates ) and Arhynchobatinae ( softnose skates ) . Skates have slow growth rates and , since they mature late , low reproductive rates . As a result skates are vulnerable to overfishing and it appears that skates have been overfished and are suffering reduced population levels in many parts of the world . The barndoor skate , Raja laevis , is currently listed with the IUCN as vulnerable due to being severely overfished . However , population data are lacking to determine the exploitation of the big skate at this time . In 2010 , Greenpeace International has added the barndoor skate , bottlenose skate , spotback skate , and maltese skate to its seafood red list .

It remained the flagship station of Guy Gannett Communications until the company sold most of its television stations , including WGME , to the Sinclair Broadcast Group in 1998 . The 493.5-meter ( 1,619 foot ) tall transmission tower of WGME , situated in Raymond , was built in 1959 . It was , according to the 1999 Guinness Book of World Records , the world 's tallest architectural structure in those days .

Princess is the feminine form of prince ( from Latin princeps , meaning principal citizen ) . Most often , the term has been used for the consort of a prince , or his daughters . For many centuries , the title `` princess '' was not regularly used for a monarch 's daughter , who might simply be called `` Lady '' or a non-English equivalent ; Old English had no female equivalent to `` prince '' , `` earl '' , or any royal or noble aside from the queen , and the women of nobility bore the title of `` Lady '' . As women have slowly gained more autonomy through European history , the title of princess has become simply the female counterpart of prince and does not necessarily imply being controlled or owned by a prince . In some cases then , a princess is the female hereditary head of state of a province or other significant area in her own right . The ancient meaning applies in Europe still to the extent that a female commoner who marries a prince will almost always become a princess , but a male commoner who marries a princess will almost never become a prince , unless his wife has , or is expected to attain , a higher title , such as Queen regnant . The implication is that if the man held the equivalent masculine title , he would have rank over his wife without the necessary pedigree . In many of Europe 's royal families , a king would grant his heirs actual or theoretical principalities to train them for future kingship or to give them social class . This practice has led over time to many people thinking that `` prince '' and `` princess '' are titles reserved for the immediate family of a king or queen . In fact , most princesses in history were not immediate members of a royal family but women who married into it ; however , in many cases , a princess would choose someone outside of royalty to wed.
Tommy Tutone is a New Wave band , best known for its 1982 hit `` 867-5309 \/ Jenny '' , which peaked at # 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 . Although it is usually referred to as a San Francisco band , it was actually based in Willits , California , at the time that `` Jenny '' was released . The song became so popular that people in the United States to this day dial this telephone number and ask for Jenny as a prank . Regarding the famous number , `` We had people threatening to sue us . It was the Buffalo Chief of Police 's daughter 's number in New York , '' said frontman Tommy Heath . Although the band is frequently remembered as a one-hit wonder , it had another top-40 hit on the Hot 100 with `` Angel Say No '' in 1980 , predating `` Jenny '' by a couple of years . A common misconception is that Tommy Tutone is the name of the lead singer ; it is actually the name of the band . Tommy Heath is the lead singer . The name of the band developed from its original name , Tommy and the Tu-tones , to merely Tommy Tutone . Heath and Jim Keller founded the band in the late 1970s , with Heath acting as the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist , also playing keyboards on occasion ; Keller playing lead guitar and supporting vocals . Bassist Jon Lyons ( original name Jonathan Lyons Terlep ) who replaced original bassist Terry Nails ( Steve Jones , Ozzy Osbourne ) was later replaced by Greg Sutton , Pete Costello , and Jimmy James . Mona Gnader , a member of Sammy Hagar 's Waborita band , played with the band as well . Original drummer Mickey Shine ( Clover and drummer on the first Elvis Costello album ) was replaced by Victor Carberry who in turn was replaced with Jerry Angel . Joe Lamond played drums in the mid to late eighties . John Cowsill of The Cowsills played drums ( and sang ) on `` 867-5309 \/ Jenny . '' From 2001 onward , the band has consisted of Heath , occasionally Costello , James , Greg Georgeson ( guitar ) and Andy Gauthier ( drums ) . Tommy Heath became a computer analyst and moved to Portland , Oregon where he worked for a startup called Cornerstone Revolutions , though he currently resides in Santa Rosa , California . In 2007 , the band signed a recording contract with Spectra Records . In 2009 , Tommy played Nashville and met with Phil Summers . As of 2010 , Tommy has relocated to Tennessee . He is working on new music and his band continues to tour the country . Jim Keller went on to become the director of Philip Glass 's publishing company , Dunvagen Music Publishers . He still performs in New York City .
Unwritten is the debut album released by pop singer Natasha Bedingfield . It was released in the UK on 6 September 2004 , where it debuted at number one , and in the U.S. on 2 August 2005 , where it debuted at number twenty-six . It spawned the singles , `` Single '' , `` These Words '' , `` Unwritten '' , `` I Bruise Easily '' and `` The One That Got Away '' ( which was only released in North America ) . The song `` Drop Me in the Middle '' featured rapper Bizarre of D12 on the international and UK versions of the album , but the U.S. version featured rapper\/singer Estelle . In 2006 , the album was re-released in North America with new album artwork and a slightly altered track listing . 12 . `` Size Matters '' ( Bedingfield , Frampton , Kipner , Wilkins ) â `` 3:23 ( UK only bonus track ) 13 . `` Peace of Me '' ( Bedingfield , Kara Dioguardi , Pat Leonard ) â `` 3:42 ( UK only bonus track ) Begins following Track 11 on international pressings , and Track 13 on UK pressings . The album was certified Gold in the U.S. by the RIAA on 9 March 2006 for shipment of 500,000 copies . Total sales for the album are 820,081 in the United States . For more information , see Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal In November 2005 , it was revealed that Sony BMG was distributing albums with Extended Copy Protection , a controversial feature that automatically installed rootkit software on any Microsoft Windows machine upon insertion of the disc . In addition to preventing the CD 's contents from being copied , it was also revealed that the software reported the users ' listening habits back to Sony and also exposed the computer to malicious attacks that exploited insecure features of the rootkit software . Though Sony initially refused to release a list of the affected CDs , the Electronic Frontier Foundation identified Unwritten as one of the discs with the invasive software . However , the DualDisc release does not contain such software .

The British Rail Class 305 was an alternating current ( AC ) electric multiple unit ( EMU ) . Under the pre-1973 British Rail numbering system , the class was known as AM5 . When TOPS as introduced , the class became Class 305 . 305\/1 units were generally deployed on inner suburban services on the Lea Valley Line out of London Liverpool Street to Chingford , Enfield Town and Hertford East . However , they were also used on the Great Eastern lines out of London Liverpool Street and occasionally worked out of their â normalâ operating area when coupled to a 305\/2 unit or any of the compatible EMUs in use at the time . 305\/1 units were replaced from 1980 onwards by British Rail Class 315 units . They were not used elsewhere and all examples of the sub class were scrapped . 305\/2 units were generally deployed on outer suburban services on the Lea Valley Line out of London Liverpool Street to Bishops Stortford ( the extent of electrification until 1987 ) . Like the 305\/1 units , they could occasionally be seen on other services out of Liverpool Street and were sometimes coupled to other compatible EMUs for multiple working . The 305\/2s were initially replaced on the Lea Valley Line by British Rail Class 317 units during the late 1980s\/early 1990s . Most of the 305\/2s moved to the Manchester area , taking over services previously diagrammed by Class 304 units . The remainder moved to Glasgow Shields depot , finishing their working lives running the route from Edinburgh to North Berwick . AC EMU Group aimed to save a Class 305 driving trailer , but by the time funding was found , they had all been scrapped , so a Class 308 driving trailer was saved instead .
A zoospore is a motile asexual spore that uses a flagellum for locomotion . Also called a swarm spore , these spores are created by some algae , bacteria and fungi to propagate themselves . There are two types of flagellated zoospores , tinsel or `` decorated '' , and whiplash . Tinsellated flagella have lateral filaments perpendicular to the main axis which allow for more surface area , and disturbance of the medium , giving it the property of a rudder , that is , the purpose of being used for steering . The phyla Chytridiomycota ( Kingdom Fungi ) , Oomycota ( Kingdom Chromista ) , and Hyphochytridiomycota within ( Kingdom Chromista ) , produce zoospores with flagella in the same order as described above ( e.g. Hyphochytridiomycota produces anterior whiplash and none else ) . These phyla number 1000 + , 580 and 16 species respectively .
In geometry , topology and related branches of mathematics a spatial point is a primitive notion upon which other concepts may be defined . In geometry , points have neither volume , area , length , nor any other higher dimensional analog . Thus , a point is a 0-dimensional object . In branches of mathematics dealing with set theory , an element is often referred to as a point . A point could also be defined as a sphere which has a diameter of zero . Points are most often considered within the framework of Euclidean geometry , where they are one of the fundamental objects . Euclid originally defined the point vaguely , as `` that which has no part '' . In two dimensional Euclidean space , a point is represented by an ordered pair , , of numbers , where the first number conventionally represents the horizontal and is often denoted by , and the second number conventionally represents the vertical and is often denoted by . This idea is easily generalized to three dimensional Euclidean space , where a point is represented by an ordered triplet , , with the additional third number representing depth and often denoted by . Further generalizations are represented by an ordered tuplet of n terms , where n is the dimension of the space in which the point is located . Many constructs within Euclidean geometry consist of an infinite collection of points that conform to certain axioms . This is usually represented by a set of points ; As an example , a line is an infinite set of points of the form , where through and are constants and n is the dimension of the space . Similar constructions exist that define the plane , line segment and other related concepts . In addition to defining points and constructs related to points , Euclid also postulated a key idea about points ; he claimed that any two points can be connected by a straight line . This is easily confirmed under modern expansions of Euclidean geometry , and had lasting consequences at its introduction , allowing the construction of almost all the geometric concepts of the time . However , Euclid 's postulation of points was neither complete nor definitive , as he occasionally assumed facts about points that did n't follow directly from his axioms , such as the ordering of points on the line or the existence of specific points . In spite of this , modern expansions of the system serve to remove these assumptions . A point in point-set topology is defined as a member of the underlying set of a topological space . Although the notion of a point is generally considered fundamental in mainstream geometry and topology , there are some systems that forgo it , e.g. noncommutative geometry and pointless topology . A â pointless spaceâ is defined not as a set , but via some structure ( algebraic or logical respectively ) which looks like a well-known function space on the set : an algebra of continuous functions or an algebra of sets respectively . More precisely , such structures generalize well-known spaces of functions in a way that the operation â take a value at this pointâ may not be defined . A point is also a location and it has no size .

The Bond albedo , named after the American astronomer George Phillips Bond ( 1825 â `` 1865 ) , who originally proposed it , is the fraction of power in the total electromagnetic radiation incident on an astronomical body that is scattered back out into space . It takes into account all wavelengths at all phase angles . It is an important quantity for characterizing a planetary body 's energy balance . For objects in the solar system , the relevant weighting of each wavelength is proportional to the solar power spectrum . Visible light is a major contribution because over 40 % of solar output is in this range . Like most albedos , the Bond albedo is a value between 0 and 1 . Because bodies in the outer solar system are always observed at very low phase angles from the Earth , the only reliable data for measuring their Bond albedo comes from spacecraft . The Bond albedo was originally defined for spherical bodies , but is also applicable for irregular objects . The phase angle Î is the angle between the source of the radiation ( usually the Sun ) and the observing direction , and varies from zero for light scattered back towards the source , to 180 Â for observations looking towards the source . For example , during opposition or looking at the full moon , Î is very small , while backlit objects or the new moon have Î close to 180 Â . The Bond albedo may be greater or smaller than the geometric albedo , depending on surface and atmospheric properties of the body in question . Some examples :
Thomas Morstead is an American football punter . He was a fifth-round draft choice of the New Orleans Saints , 164th overall , in the 2009 NFL Draft . He was the second punter taken overall . He played college football at SMU . Morstead is currently the punter and kickoff specialist for the Saints . At Pearland High School , Morstead received second-team All-District honors and was named Brazoria County Special Teams MVP as a senior , handling all kicking chores . He also lettered in soccer and was a member of the National Honor Society , adding Academic All-State honors . Morstead decided to enroll at Southern Methodist in 2004 , turning down scholarship offers from Texas Christian , Rice , Texas and Missouri , but spent the season as a redshirt . He was a member of the Conference USA 's Academic Honor Roll in 2005 , but never appeared in a game . Morstead took over place-kicking and punting chores in 2006 , earning All-Conference USA third-team honors . He led the league and ranked 15th in the nation in punting , averaging 43.82 yards on 50 attempts , the best average by an SMU punter since Craig James averaged 44.9 yards in 1982 . He made 13 of 18 field goals and 34 of 35 extra points for a total of 73 points , as he also recorded one solo tackle . As a sophomore Morstead was a consensus All-Conference USA first-team pick and also gained league academic honors . He again led C-USA and finished eighth nationally with a 44.65-yard average , as the Mustangs also ranked fourth in the NCAA with a 39.33-yard net average . He scored 82 points and set the league single-season record by making all 43 PAT attempts , as he also connected on 13 of 20 field goals . Morstead concentrated more on directional punting in 2008 . The All-Conference USA honorable mention averaged a career-low 41.78 yards on 59 punts , but only 19 were returned , as the Mustangs placed third in the league with a 37.22-yard net average . He made 11 of 15 field goals , 29 of 30 extra points and amassed 62 points . Morstead missed three kicks inside of 40 yards in 2008 , four in both 2006 and 2007 . He played a critical role in the Saints ' victory over the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLIV . Morstead kicked an onside kick during the opening kickoff of the second half . The Saints were able to recover the ball and were later able to convert into a touchdown , giving the Saints a 13-10 lead . The Saints would eventually win the game 31-17 . After the game , Morstead stated that while he was excited about executing the play , he was also terrified knowing that if the play was not executed perfectly , the Colts would have likely recovered the ball with a shot of extending their 10-6 lead .
Les Moutiers Hubert is a commune in the department of Calvados in the Basse-Normandie region in northwestern France .
Copper ( I ) oxide or cuprous oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula Cu2O . It is one of the principal oxides of copper . This red-coloured solid is a component of some antifouling paints . The compound can appear either yellow or red , depending on the size of the particles , but both forms degrade to copper ( II ) oxides in moist air . Copper ( I ) oxide is found as the reddish mineral cuprite . Copper ( I ) oxide may be produced by several methods . Most straightforwardly , it arises via the oxidation of copper metal : 4 Cu + O2 â ' 2 Cu2O Additives such as water and acids affect the rate of this process as well as the further oxidation to copper ( II ) oxides . It is also produced commercially by reduction of copper ( II ) solutions with sulfur dioxide . Aqueous cuprous chloride solutions react with base to give the same material . In all cases , the color is highly sensitive to the procedural details . Formation of copper ( I ) oxide is the basis of the Fehling 's test and Benedict 's test for reducing sugars . These sugars reduce an alkaline solution of a copper ( II ) salt , giving a bright red precipitate of Cu2O . It forms on silver-plated copper parts exposed to moisture when the silver layer is porous or damaged . This kind of corrosion is known as red plague . The solid is diamagnetic . In terms of their coordination spheres , copper centres are 2-coordinated and the oxides are tetrahedral . The structure thus resembles in some sense the main polymorphs of SiO2 , and both structures feature interpenetrated lattices . Copper ( I ) oxide dissolves in concentrated ammonia solution to form the colourless complex ( Cu ( NH3 ) 2 ) + , which easily oxidizes in air to the blue ( Cu ( NH3 ) 4 ( H2O ) 2 ) 2 + . It dissolves in hydrochloric acid to give solutions of CuCl2 - . Dilute sulfuric acid and nitric acid produce copper ( II ) sulfate and copper ( II ) nitrate , respectively . Cu2O crystallizes in a cubic structure with a lattice constant al = 4.2696 Ã The Cu atoms arrange in a fcc sublattice , the O atoms in a bcc sublattice . The unit cell contains 4 Cu atoms and 2 O atoms . One sublattice is shifted by a quarter of the body diagonal . The space group is , which includes the point group with full octahedral symmetry . Today , it is still under investigation in semiconductor optics . Particularly people are trying to create a Bose-Einstein condensate of excitons in Cu2O . The lowest excitons in Cu2O are extremely long living and show a neV resonance , which is the narrowest bulk exciton resonance ever observed . The associated quadrupole polaritons have low group velocity approaching the speed of sound . Thus , light moves almost as slowly as sound in this medium , which results in high polariton densities . Another unusual feature of the ground state excitons is that all primary scattering mechanisms are known quantitatively . Cu2O was the first substance where an entirely parameter-free model of absorption linewidth broadening by temperature could be established , allowing the corresponding absorption coefficient to be deduced . It can be shown using Cu2O that the Kramersâ `` Kronig relations do not apply to polaritons . Cuprous oxide is commonly used as a pigment , a fungicide , and an antifouling agent for marine paints . Rectifier diodes based on this material have been used industrially as early as 1924 , long before silicon became the standard .
Krumbach ( also : Krumbach ( Schwaben ) ) is a town with about 12.500 residents in the district GÃ 1\/4 nzburg in the Bavarian administrative region Swabia , Germany . It is the second biggest town in the district . Krumbach ( elevation 512 m ( 1680 ft ) ) is situated in Mittelschwaben in the natural region Lower Iller-Lech Gravel Plateau ( a part of the region between Danube and the Alps ) in the valley of the Kammel , a left tributary of the Mindel river and so an indirect tributary of the Danube river . The landscape is marked by forests and areas in agricultural acreage ( fields and grassland ) . The next bigger cities respectively towns are Ulm , approximately 40 kilometres northwest of Krumbach , Augsburg , 48 kilometres northeast of Krumbach , Memmingen , about 40 km kilometres southwest of Krumbach , Mindelheim , 30 kilometres south of Krumbach and GÃ 1\/4 nzburg , 27 kilometres north of Krumbach . The distance to Munich is approximately 120 kilometres . In 1156 Krumbach was mentioned in documents the first time , in 1370 the village got the right to hold a market . From 1305 until 1805 Krumbach was part of the Margraviate of Burgau , which was part of the Habsburgian Further Austria . In the year 1805 Krumbach became Bavarian by the Peace of Pressburg . 90 years later Krumbach became a town . In the year 1902 the previously independent municipality HÃ 1\/4 rben , a neighbouring village of Krumbach , merged into Krumbach . Until the time of the Third Reich HÃ 1\/4 rben had a high percentage of Jewish residents in comparison to the Bavarian average . Until 1972 Krumbach was the district seat of the administrative district Krumbach ( Swabia ) . Bavarian regional reforms merged the previously independent municipalities of Hohenraunau ( 1972\/01\/01 ) , Billenhausen with Hirschfelden ( 1972\/07\/01 ) , Edenhausen with the Krumbad ( 1973\/01\/01 ) , Attenhausen ( 1977\/01\/01 ) and Niederraunau ( 1978\/05\/01 ) into Krumbach . The Krumbad is a health resort approximately one kilometre east of Krumbach . It is the oldest health resort of Swabia . The colors of the town ( red and white ) as well as the arms ( a silver-coloured waved thik line in red ) remind one on the one hand of the long affiliation to Further Austria on the other hand it is a canting arms â `` the crooked stream . In this context it is important to know , that the meander of the Kammel are clearly distinct . In Krumbach there are car suppliers , a paintfactory , plant construction factories , weaving mills , waxfactories and a wall-to-wall carpetingfactory . Two BundesstraÃ en pass Krumbach : the BundesstraÃ e 16 ( B 16 ) GÃ 1\/4 nzburg-Mindelheim and the BundesstraÃ e 300 ( B 300 ) Memmingen-Augsburg . The distances to the Autobahnen 7 , 8 and 96 are each approximately 25 kilometres . Furthermore Krumbach has a railway station at the railway from GÃ 1\/4 nzburg to Mindelheim ( Mittelschwaben Railway ) , a loop line , which connects the main lines Bavarian Maximilian Railway ( Munich-Augsburg-Ulm-Stuttgart ) and the railway from Munich to Zurich via Buchloe , Memmingen and Lindau ( Bodensee ) . In the valley of GÃ 1\/4 nz â `` approximately six kilometres west of Krumbach there is the Oberrieder Weiher , a flooded gravel pit and popular greenbelt recreation area . At the shores of this lake there is a campingsite , too .
The NOR gate is a digital logic gate that implements logical NOR - it behaves according to the truth table to the right . A HIGH output ( 1 ) results if both the inputs to the gate are LOW ( 0 ) . If one or both input is HIGH ( 1 ) , a LOW output ( 0 ) results . NOR is the result of the negation of the OR operator . NOR is a functionally complete operationâ '' combinations of NOR gates can be combined to generate any other logical function . By contrast , the OR operator is monotonic as it can only change LOW to HIGH but not vice versa . In most , but not all , circuit implementations , the negation comes for freeâ '' including CMOS and TTL . In such logic families , the only way to implement OR is with 2 or more gates , such as a NOR followed by an inverter . A significant exception is some forms of the domino logic family . The original Apollo Guidance Computer used 4,100 ICs , each one containing only a single 3-input NOR gate . There are three symbols for NOR gates : the American ( ANSI or ` military ' ) symbol and the IEC ( ` European ' or ` rectangular ' ) symbol , as well as the deprecated DIN symbol . For more information see Logic Gate Symbols . NOR Gates are basic logic gates , and as such they are recognized in TTL and CMOS ICs . The standard , 4000 series , CMOS IC is the 4001 , which includes four independent , two-input , NOR gates . The pinout diagram is as follows : These devices are available from most semiconductor manufacturers such as Fairchild Semiconductor , Philips or Texas Instruments . These are usually available in both through-hole DIP and SOIC format . Datasheets are readily available in most datasheet databases . In the older RTL and ECL families , NOR gates were efficient and most commonly used . This diagrams above show the construction of a 2-input NOR gate using NMOS circuitry . If either of the inputs are high , the corresponding NMOS is turned on and the output is pulled low ; otherwise the output is pulled high through the pull-up resistor . The diagram below shows a 2-input NOR gate using CMOS technology . The diodes and resistors on the inputs are to protect the CMOS components from damage due to electrostatic discharge ( ESD ) and play no part in the logical function of the circuit .

Streptococcus mutans is a Gram-positive , facultatively anaerobic bacterium commonly found in the human oral cavity and is a significant contributor to tooth decay . The microbe was first described by J Kilian Clarke in 1924 . Early colonizers of the tooth surface are mainly Neisseria spp . and streptococci , including S. mutans . The growth and metabolism of these pioneer species changes local environmental conditions ( e.g. Eh , pH , coaggregation and substrate availability ) , thereby enabling more fastidious organisms to further colonize after them , forming dental plaque . Along with S. sobrinus , S. mutans plays a major role in tooth decay , metabolizing sucrose to lactic acid using the enyzme Glucansucrase . The acidic environment created in the mouth by this process is what causes the highly mineralized tooth enamel to be vulnerable to decay . S. mutans is one of a few specialized organisms equipped with receptors that improve adhesion to the surface of teeth . Sucrose is used by S. mutans to produce a sticky , extracellular , dextran-based polysaccharide that allows them to cohere to each other , forming plaque . S. mutans produces dextran via the enzyme dextransucrase ( a hexosyltransferase ) using sucrose as a substrate in the following reaction : Sucrose is the only sugar S. mutans can use to form this sticky polysaccharide . Conversely , many other sugars -- glucose , fructose , lactose -- can be digested by S. mutans , but they produce lactic acid as an end product . It is the combination of plaque and acid that leads to dental decay . Due to the role the S. mutans plays in tooth decay , there have been many attempts to make a vaccine for the organism . So far , such vaccines have not been successful in humans . Recently , proteins involved in the colonization of teeth by S. mutans have been shown to produce antibodies that inhibit the cariogenic process .

Beckton Park DLR station is a station on the Docklands Light Railway ( DLR ) in the Docklands area of east London . The station is located by the north quay of the Royal Albert Dock ( though no foot access is possible ) . The station is opposite Beckton District South Park , which is open space leading to housing in South Beckton . The station is unmanned , like all DLR stations . There are two automated machines ( one on each opposing platform , separated by a central footbridge ) for purchasing tickets using cash or cards , and also providing facilities to examine and top up Oystercards . There are three Oystercard readers â '' one on each platform between the ticket machines and a set of stairs , and a more recently added third reader at the approach to the stationâ s connecting footbridge ( thus , due to the position , this newer Oyster readerâ s pad is protected from rain ) . The station is located on the DLR 's Beckton branch , between Royal Albert and Cyprus stations . It is in Travelcard Zone 3 . Along with neighbouring Cyprus station , Beckton Park station is of an unusual design . Between the two stations , the DLR runs in the median of a major highway built at the same time as the railway . The stations are located at highway intersections which take the form of roundabouts . On the approach to the roundabout , the road rises slightly whilst the railway dips slightly ; the station is therefore situated in a cutting , under the center of the elevated roundabout , with pedestrian access at surface level under the elevated roadways and arched over the railway . London Bus routes 376 and school routes 678 .

Unenlagia ( meaning `` half-bird '' in latinized mapudungun ) was a genus of theropod dinosaur of the family Dromaeosauridae . Unenlagia , which lived in Argentina during the Late Cretaceous , was a member of the strange and extremely bird-like Gondwanan clade of dromaeosaurs called unenlagiines , and was closely related to dinosaurs such as Buitreraptor and Neuquenraptor ( which might be the same species as Unenlagia ) . Makovicky et al . suggested that the ` flying raptor ' Rahonavis is also a member of this group , which would mean that either Unenlagia is secondarily flightless , having evolved from flying , Rahonavis-like ancestors , or that bird-like flight evolved at least twice . Norell et al . in 2006 also found Rahonavis to be the sister taxon of Unenlagia . Unenlagia was very birdlike itself . Novas and Puerta found its pelvic region to be very similar to that of the early bird Archaeopteryx . The shoulder girdle of Unenlagia was originally interpreted as if it was adapted for flapping . However , Senter has showed that this interpretation likely was a mistake , and he suggested that Unenlagia was unable to lift its forelimbs above its back , like Archaeopteryx . At 2 meters ( 6.6 ft long ) , Unenlagia was probably too big to fly ; thus , scientists consider that it either evolved from flying ancestors , or Rahonavis ( if an unenlagiine ) evolved flight from adequately adapted ( but too large ; see also exaptation ) dromaeosaurs independently of the Archaeopteryx lineage , at a time when other bird lineages were already undergoing vigorous adaptive radiation . The genus Unenlagia has been assigned two species : U. comahuensis , the type species described by Novas and Puerta in 1997 , and U. paynemili , described by Calvo et al . in 2004 .

The 1910s was the decade that started on January 1 , 1910 and ended on December 31 , 1919 . It was the second decade of the 20th century . The 1910s represented the culmination of European militarism which had its beginnings during the second half of the nineteenth century . The conservative lifestyles during the first half of the decade , as well as the legacy of military alliances , was forever changed by the assassination , on June 28 , 1914 , of Archduke Franz Ferdinand , the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne . The murder triggered a chain of events in which , within 30 days , World War I broke out in Europe . The conflict dragged on until a truce was declared on November 10 , 1918 , leading to the controversial , one-sided Treaty of Versailles , which was signed on June 28 , 1919 . The war 's end triggered the abdication of aging monarchies and the collapse of the last modern empires of Russia , Germany , the Ottomans and Austria-Hungary , with the latter splintered into Austria , Hungary , southern Poland ( who acquired most of their land in a war with Soviet Russia ) , Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia , as well as the unification of Romania with Transylvania and Moldavia . However , each of these states ( with the possible exception of Yugoslavia ) had large German and Hungarian minorities , there creating some unexpected problems that would be brought to light in the next two decades . ( See Dissolution of Austro-Hungrarian Empire : Successor States for better description of composition of names of successor countries\/states following the splinter . ) The decade was also a period of revolution in a number of countries . The Mexican Revolution spear-headed the trend in November 1910 , which led to the ousting of dictator Porfirio Diaz , developing into a civil war that dragged on until mid-1920 , not long after a new Mexican Constitution was signed and ratified . Russia also had a similar fate , since World War I led to a collapse in morale as well as to economic chaos . This atmosphere encouraged the establishment of Bolshevism , which was later renamed as communism . Like the Mexican Revolution , the Russian Revolution of 1917 , known as the October Revolution , immediately turned to Russian Civil War that dragged until approximately late 1920 . Much of the music in these years was ballroom-themed . Many of the fashionable restaurants were equipped with dance floors . Prohibition in the United States began January 16 , 1919 , with the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution . The 1913 Armory Show in New York City was a seminal event in the history of Modern Art . Innovative contemporaneous artists from Europe and the United States exhibited together in a massive group exhibition in New York City , and Chicago .

38628 Huya is a trans-Neptunian object ( TNO ) . It was discovered in March 2000 by Ignacio Ferrin and announced on 24 October 2000 . It is classified as a plutino being in a 2:3 mean motion resonance with Neptune . With a Spitzer size estimate of , this plutino is also a dwarf planet candidate . It is expected to be spherical ( trans-Neptunian object with a diameter above around 400 km ) . It was assigned the name Huya , after JuyÃ , the Wayuu rain god , in August 2003 by the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) . At the time of its discovery , Huya was the biggest and brightest trans-Neptunian object found since Pluto . It was found using data collected by at the CIDA Observatory in Venezuela . The Spitzer Space Telescope has estimated Huya to be about 530 km in diameter with a low albedo of around 0.05 . The object has a red-sloped reflectance spectrum in the visible and near-infrared , suggesting a surface rich in organic material such as tholins . There is a broad absorption feature near 2 Î 1\/4 m possible belonging to water ice or some water altered material . Additional absorption features may be present near 0.6 â `` 0.8 Î 1\/4 m , which may be caused by aqueously altered anhydrous silicates . Huya is currently 28.7 AU from the Sun , and will come to perihelion ( q = 28.52 AU ) in 2015 . This means that this dwarf planet candidate is currently inside the orbit of the planet Neptune . Like Pluto , this plutino spends part of its orbit closer to the Sun than Neptune even though their orbits are controlled by Neptune . Huya will be closer to the Sun than Neptune is until about July 2029 . Simulations by the Deep Ecliptic Survey ( DES ) show that over the next 10 million years Huya can acquire a perihelion distance ( qmin ) as small as 27.28 AU . Plutinos and get even closer to the Sun . Given the long orbit that TNOs have around the sun , Huya comes to opposition in early May of each year at an apparent magnitude of 19.3 . Huya has been observed 131 times with precovery images back to 1996 . The rotation period of Huya is unknown .
Oni are creatures from Japanese folklore , variously translated as demons , devils , ogres or trolls . They are popular characters in Japanese art , literature and theater . Depictions of oni vary widely but usually portray them as hideous , gigantic creatures with sharp claws , wild hair , and two long horns growing from their heads . They are humanoid for the most part , but occasionally , they are shown with unnatural features such as odd numbers of eyes or extra fingers and toes . Their skin may be any number of colors , but red and blue are particularly common . They are often depicted wearing tiger-skin loincloths and carrying iron clubs , called kanabÅ . This image leads to the expression `` oni with an iron club '' , that is , to be invincible or undefeatable . It can also be used in the sense of `` strong beyond strong '' , or having one 's natural quality enhanced or supplemented by the use of some tool . The word `` oni '' is sometimes speculated to be derived from on , the on ` yomi reading of a character meaning to hide or conceal , as oni were originally invisible spirits or gods which caused disasters , disease , and other unpleasant things . These nebulous beings could also take on a variety of forms to deceive ( and often devour ) humans . Thus a Chinese character meaning `` ghost '' came to be used for these formless creatures . The invisible oni eventually became anthropomorphized and took on its modern , ogre-like form , partly via syncretism with creatures imported by Buddhism , such as the Indian rakshasa and yaksha , the hungry ghosts called gaki , and the devilish underlings of Enma - Å who punish sinners in Jigoku ( Hell ) . Another source for the oni 's image is a concept from China and OnmyÅ dÅ . The northeast direction was once termed the kimon ( é 1\/4 é -- , `` demon gate '' ) , and was considered an unlucky direction through which evil spirits passed . Based on the assignment of the twelve zodiac animals to the cardinal directions , the kimon was also known as the ushitora ( ä ` å Temples are often built facing that direction , and Japanese buildings sometimes have L-shaped indentions at the northeast to ward oni away . Enryakuji , on Mount Hiei northeast of the center of Kyoto , and Kaneiji , in that direction from Edo Castle , are examples . The Japanese capital itself moved northeast from Nagaoka to Kyoto in the 8th century . Some villages hold yearly ceremonies to drive away oni , particularly at the beginning of Spring . During the Setsubun festival , people throw soybeans outside their homes and shout `` Oni wa soto ! Fuku wa uchi ! '' . Monkey statues are also thought to guard against oni , since the Japanese word for monkey , saru , is a homophone for the word for `` leaving '' . Folklore has it that holly can be used to guard against Oni . In Japanese versions of the game tag , the player who is `` it '' is instead called the `` oni '' . In more recent times , oni have lost some of their original wickedness and sometimes take on a more protective function . Men in oni costumes often lead Japanese parades to ward off any bad luck , for example . Japanese buildings sometimes include oni-faced roof tiles called onigawara , which are thought to ward away bad luck , much as gargoyles in Western tradition . Oni are prominently featured in the Japanese children 's story Momotaro ( Peach Boy ) , and the book The Funny Little Woman . Many Japanese idioms and proverbs also make reference to oni . For example , the expression oya-ni ninu ko-wa oni-no ko means literally `` a child that does not resemble its parents is the child of an oni , '' but it is used idiomatically to refer to the fact that all children naturally take after their parents , and in the odd case that a child appears not to do so , it might be because the child 's true biological parents are not the ones who are raising the child . Depending on the context in which it is used , it can have connotations of `` children who do not act like their parents are not true human beings , '' and may be used by a parent to chastise a misbehaving child . Variants of this expression include oya-ni ninu ko-wa onigo and oya-ni ninu ko-wa onikko .

As a means of recording the passage of time , the 16th century lasted from 1501 to 1600 . During the 16th century , Spain and Portugal explored the world 's seas and opened world-wide oceanic trade routes . Large parts of the New World became Spanish and Portuguese colonies , and while the Portuguese became the masters of Asia 's and Africa 's Indian Ocean trade , the Spanish opened trade across the Pacific Ocean , linking the Americas with Asia . In Europe , the Protestant Reformation gave a major blow to the authority of the Papacy and the Roman Catholic Church . European politics became dominated by religious conflicts , with the groundwork for the epochal Thirty Years ' War being laid towards the end of the century . In the Middle East , the Ottoman Empire continued to expand , with the Sultan taking the title of Caliph , while dealing with a resurgent Persia . Iran and Iraq were caught by major popularity of the once-obscure Shiite sect of Islam under the rule of the Safavid dynasty of warrior-mystics , providing grounds for a Persia independent of the majority-Sunni Muslim world . China evacuated the coastal areas , because of Japanese piracy . Japan was suffering under a severe civil war at the time . Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great tried to reconcile the major religions by founding a new religion , Din-i-Ilahi . Akbar was convinced that no religion has the absolute truth .

The SEAT Arosa ( Typ 6H ) is a city car from the Spanish automaker SEAT , a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group , built between 1997 and 2004 . The pre-facelift model debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1997 , while its facelifted model was presented at the Paris Motor Show in April 2000 and was in production until 2004 . Named after VillagarcÃ a Arosa , a municipality in the province of Pontevedra , Spain , it was only available as a three-door , four-seater hatchback . The Arosa , launched in 1997 , was to a large extent identical to Volkswagen 's own city car which was introduced later in 1998 , Volkswagen Lupo , and both cars were based on the Volkswagen Group A00 platform , a shortened version of the A03 platform used by the larger Volkswagen Polo and SEAT Ibiza . The Arosa was initially manufactured at a Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg , Germany , and only in May 1998 was the production moved to SEAT facilities in Martorell in Spain . The model later received a facelift in 2001 . The Arosa replaced the SEAT Marbella in the Spanish brand 's lineup , but was not itself replaced by any SEAT model when production ceased in 2005 . SEAT will revive the car in late 2011 with a electric version in 2013 . The Arosa was designed by the same man who designed the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 , Jozef KabaÅ . In 1999 SEAT presented the SEAT Arosa 3L to be launched in early 2000 , a lightweight car fitted with a 61 P 1.2 L TDI three-cylinder turbo diesel engine and consumption 2.99 L. In order to reduce its fuel consumption , there has been an extensive use of aluminium and other light materials cutting weight to 860 k , improvements in lowering the air resistance , Start-Stop modules and use of low-friction tires put into alloy wheels . The model was also equipped with an electronically-driven automatic transmission with three modes : ` Eco ' , Normal and ` Tiptronic ' . This combination of powertrain and saving weight allowed the Arosa 3L to accelerate from zero to 100 km\/h in 14.7 seconds , and reach a top speed of 164 k. All engines came with a 5-speed manual transmission , with a 4-speed automatic optional on the 1.4 ( 44 kW ) . Since its launch in 1997 up to 2004 , more than 175,000 SEAT Arosa cars have been sold and produced . The second generation Arosa will be sold in late 2011 with an electric version in 2013 .
The LP was called `` Porsuigieco '' ( Mix of RaÃ l Porchetto , Sui Generis , LeÃ n Gieco ) A regular polygon is a polygon which is equiangular ( all angles are equal in measure ) and equilateral ( all sides have the same length ) . Regular polygons may be convex or star . These properties apply to all regular polygons ( both convex and a star ) . A regular n-sided polygon has rotational symmetry of order n. All vertices of a regular polygon lie on a common circle ( the circumscribed circle ) , i.e. , they are concyclic points . Together with the property of equal-length sides , this implies that every regular polygon also has an inscribed circle or incircle which is tangent to every side at the mid-point . A regular n-sided polygon can be constructed with compass and straightedge if and only if the odd prime factors of n are distinct Fermat primes . See constructible polygon . The symmetry group of an n-sided regular polygon is dihedral group Dn ( of order 2n ) : D2 , D3 , D4 , ... It consists of the rotations in Cn , together with reflection symmetry in n axes that pass through the center . If n is even then half of these axes pass through two opposite vertices , and the other half through the midpoint of opposite sides . If n is odd then all axes pass through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side . All regular simple polygons ( a simple polygon is one which does not intersect itself anywhere ) are convex . Those having the same number of sides are also similar . An n-sided convex regular polygon is denoted by its SchlÃ fli symbol . In certain contexts all the polygons considered will be regular . In such circumstances it is customary to drop the prefix regular . For instance all the faces of uniform polyhedra must be regular and the faces will be described simply as triangle , square , pentagon , etc. and each exterior angle ( supplementary to the interior angle ) has a measure of degrees , with the sum of the exterior angles equal to 360 degrees or 2 Ï radians or one full turn . For the number of diagonals is , i.e. , 0 , 2 , 5 , 9 , ... for a triangle , quadrilateral , pentagon , hexagon , ... The diagonals divide the polygon into 1 , 4 , 11 , 24 , ... pieces . For a regular n-gon inscribed in a unit-radius circle , the product of the distances from a given vertex to all other vertices ( including adjacent vertices and vertices connected by a diagonal ) equals n. The amounts that the areas are less than those of circles with the same perimeter , are ( rounded ) equal to 0.28 for n = 3 , 0.27 for 37 , reducing as n increases to 0.262 for n ) 15 and to 0.2618 for all n ) 58 . Of all n-gons with a given perimeter , the one with the largest area is regular . A non-convex regular polygon is a regular star polygon . The most common example is the pentagram , which has the same vertices as a pentagon , but connects alternating vertices . For an n-sided star polygon , the SchlÃ fli symbol is modified to indicate the density or ` starriness ' m of the polygon , as . If m is 2 , for example , then every second point is joined . If m is 3 , then every third point is joined . The boundary of the polygon winds around the center m times . m and n must be co-prime , or the figure will degenerate . Depending on the precise derivation of the SchlÃ fli symbol , opinions differ as to the nature of the degenerate figure . For example may be treated in either of two ways : All regular polygons are self-dual to congruency , and for odd n they are self-dual to identity . In addition the regular star figures ( compounds ) , being composed of regular polygons , are also self-dual . A uniform polyhedron has regular polygons as faces , such that for every two vertices there is an isometry mapping one into the other ( just as there is for a regular polygon ) . A quasiregular polyhedron is a uniform polyhedron which has just two kinds of face alternating around each vertex . A regular polyhedron is a uniform polyhedron which has just one kind of face . The remaining ( non-uniform ) convex polyhedra with regular faces are known as the Johnson solids .
Enfield Lock railway station is in the London Borough of Enfield in north east London , and is in Travelcard Zone 6 , on the Tottenham Hale branch of the Lea Valley Lines , on the West Anglian Railway . The station , and all trains serving it , are operated by National Express East Anglia . Enfield Lock was the main station for the Royal Small Arms Factory until its closure in the late 1980s , and now serves the large housing development on the site known as Enfield Island Village , as well as the nearby Innova Science and Business park . The railway line from Stratford to Broxbourne was opened by the Northern & Eastern Railway on 15 September 1840 . The station itself was opened by the Eastern Counties Railway in 1855 as Ordnance Factory , later renamed to Enfield Lock . The lines through Enfield Lock were electrified on May 5 , 1969 .
Woluwe-Saint-Pierre or Sint-Pieters-Woluwe ( Dutch , pronounced ) is one of the nineteen municipalities located in the Brussels-Capital Region of Belgium . It is mostly a well-to-do residential area , which includes the wide , park-lined , Avenue de Tervueren and the numerous embassies located near the Montgomery Square . Of the three rivers that once crossed the municipality , only the Woluwe , a tributary of the Senne , can still largely be seen today . The first appearance of the name Wolewe dates from 1117 and can be found in a charter from Forest ( Vorst in Dutch ) . At that time , the original hamlet and its farms were dependencies of the abbey of Park near Leuven . The onset of difficulties can be traced to the middle of the 16th century , with the hostilities waged by Philip II of Spain against the heretical Protestants and the ensuing poverty and famine took their toll on the entire population . Safety and prosperity returned under the reigns of Archdukes Albert and Isabella at the beginning of the 17th century . The first highway linking Tervuren to Brussels , then known as the â Street of the Dukeâ , dates from that period . The French Revolution was also a troubled period for Woluwe-Saint-Pierre â `` Sint-Pieters-Woluwe . The roads became insecure ; the religious freedoms were drastically curtailed ; much of the local wild life was exterminated for food ; and the lack of coal and wood forced people to use peat for heating . The local administration gained its independence from Brussels , obtained its first mayor on May 26 and its first municipal council in 1819 . The commercial opportunities that opened up to the new commune marked the start of a new era of wealth . The city did not expand very fast , however , until the last two decades of the 19th century . New roads , such as the Tervuren Avenue , a new train track , imposing mansions , such as the â Palais Stocletâ , and the Woluwe Park were all built or designed between 1880 and 1910 . An important race track , now demolished , was built in 1906 . The residential areas came into being right after the First World War and further urbanization took place after the Second World War . Today , agriculture and fisheries , common before 1918 , have completely disappeared . The area lives nearly exclusively off the service sector of the economy .
When the functional group attacking the peptide bond is a thiol , hydroxyl or amine , the resulting molecule may be called a cyclol or , more specifically , a thiacyclol , an oxacyclol or an azacyclol , respectively . Repenomamus is the largest mammal known from the Cretaceous period of Manchuria , and it is the mammal for which there is the best evidence that it fed on dinosaurs . It is not possible to determine if Repenomamus actively hunted live dinosaurs or scavenged dead dinosaurs . Repenomamus was probably not a fast runner . The humerus and femur left their joints at a somewhat splayed angle , and the legs were relatively short compared to the body . The feet were plantigrade . Repenomamuss behavior and overall body shape may have resembled those of modern day Tasmanian devils . Repenomamus was carnivorous . A specimen of R. robustus has been discovered with the fragmentary skeleton of a juvenile Psittacosaurus preserved in its stomach . This is the strongest evidence that Mesozoic mammals fed on dinosaurs , creating interest in the popular press . There were , however , earlier indications that Mesozoic mammals fed on dinosaurs ( see Archaeornithoides ) . The larger species , R. giganticus , holds the distinction of being the largest mammal known from the Cretaceous . A few other described mammals , such as an early giant platypus , Kollikodon , may have been larger , but they are only known from small fragments so their actual size is in question . R. giganticus was more than 1 m ( 39 in ) long and weighed about 12 -- 14 kg ( 26 -- 31 lb ) . Its skull measures 16 cm ( 6.25 in ) long , its body 52 cm ( 20.5 in ) , and the preserved part of its tail 36 cm ( 14 in ) . The other species , R. robustus , was less than 50 cm ( 20 in ) long and weighed 4 -- 6 kg ( 9 -- 13 lb ) . These finds are considered important , because they expand the ecological niches known to be inhabited by mammals during the 150 million year reign of the dinosaurs . Previously , the only known mammals of this time period were small nocturnal insectivores , not unlike modern-day shrews . It had been assumed the niches of animals more than 1 m ( 39 in ) long were filled entirely by dinosaurs and reptiles like crocodilians , and were off limits to mammals until after the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event wiped out the dinosaurs and allowed the diversification of mammals during the Cenozoic . Repenomamus disproves this . R. giganticus is larger than a number of species of feathered dinosaurs also from the same rock formation in China , including Sinornithosaurus , Caudipteryx and Mei . The fossils were recovered from the lagerstÃ tte of the Yixian Formation in the Liaoning province of China , which is renowned for its extraordinarily well-preserved fossils of feathered dinosaurs . They have been specifically dated to 130 million years ago , during the Early Cretaceous period . Repenomamus is a genus of triconodonts , a group of early mammals with no modern relatives . R. robustus was described by Li , Wang , Wang and Li in 2000 , and R. giganticus was described by Hu , Meng , Wang , Li 2005 . The two known species are the sole members of the family Repenomamidae , which was also described in the same paper in 2000 .
The Birmingham Triennial Musical Festival , in Birmingham , England , founded in 1784 , was the longest-running classical music festival of its kind . Its last performance was in 1912 . The first music festival , over three days in September 1768 , was to help raise funds to complete the new General Hospital on Summer Lane . It proved to be very popular and successful , but it took another event in 1778 to achieve the funds required . The hospital opened September 1779 . From September 1784 the performances became a permanent feature and ran every three years , becoming the Birmingham Triennial Musical Festival , still with the aim of raising funds for the hospital . Originally hosted in St Philip 's Church ( later to become the Cathedral ) or the Theatre Royale on New Street the available venues became too small for the festival . As a result , the Birmingham Town Hall was built , and opened in 1834 to house it . The festival for 1832 was delayed by two years during its erection . Vocal works were generally sung in English . Hans Richter was appointed principal conductor in 1885 . In 1837 Felix Mendelssohn conducted a performance of his St. Paul oratorio , played the organ , and played the piano part in the premiere of his second Piano Concerto , specially commissioned by the Festival . He appeared in the following festival , playing his first Piano Concerto . For the 1846 festival he composed and conducted the premiere of his oratorio Elijah , another new work commissioned by the Festival . He was paid 200 guineas . Elijah was played at every successive festival . Mendelssohn died a year later . In 1873 the Festival commissioned Arthur Sullivan who composed his oratorio The Light of the World . The 1879 Festival commissioned a work from Max Bruch , Das Lied von der Glocke . In 1882 Charles Gounod was commissioned and produced Redemption , which was performed twice . In 1885 AntonÃ n DvoÅ Ã k provided The Spectre 's Bride and Gounod provided Mors et Vita . In 1891 DvoÅ Ã k 's commission delivered his Requiem for Â # 650 . 1900 saw the commission The Dream of Gerontius from Edward Elgar . The chorus master had died suddenly four months before the concert was due , and with ten works in hand and only one copy of the score , rehearsal started only a few days before the performance date . It was not sung well but was strongly applauded and well reviewed as a composition . He returned in 1903 with The Apostles , and 1906 with The Kingdom . His commission for 1912 created The Music Makers , incorporating themes from the Enigma Variations , Gerontius , his violin concerto , and The Apostles . The principal conductor for 1912 was Henry Wood . The 1909 and 1912 festivals ran at a loss , providing no donation to the General Hospital . World War I marked the end of the Triennial Festivals .

The Å koda Felicia , ( Typ 791 ) is a small family car produced by the Czech automaker Å koda Auto between 1994 and 2001 ( 1995 - 2001 for the estate ) . It was one of the first models to benefit from Å koda Auto 's takeover by the German giant Volkswagen Group . The Felicia was a reworked version of the Favorit , but had a fresh , more modern appearance , with a redesigned front end , and a wider range of internal combustion engines . It was premiered in October 1994 on the Charles Bridge in Prague . Serial production begin in October 1994 , and ended June 2001 . The name Felicia was not used for the first time , resurrecting a nameplate originally used by Å koda in the 1960s for a range two-seater sports cars . They were very popular . As the Felicia benefited from Volkswagen input , it helped to elevate Å koda 's image in Western Europe . It heralded the first ever diesel-powered Å koda , and became their first car to feature major safety and convenience features . Some SLXi models featured air conditioning and velor upholstery . Anti-lock Braking System ( ABS ) , drivers airbag , and seat belt tensioners were also available . In 1998 , the Felicia made headlines after its high satisfaction score gave Å koda the `` Best Manufacturer '' accolade in that year 's J.D. Power Car Survey . Production of the Felicia ceased at the end of June 2001 , one year after the launch of the Fabia . A total of 1,416,939 cars had been made ( the pick-up model was available for sale throughout 2001 ) . The Felicia came in a variety of body styles , both for personal and professional use . The base model was a five-door hatchback , and from June 1995 , was accompanied by an estate â '' replacing the Favorit-based Forman - now redubbed as the Felicia Combi ( Typ 795 ) . There was also a pick-up version , the Felicia Pickup , ( Typ 797 ) and a panel van called a Felicia VanPlus . The pick-up version was also imported to some countries re-branded as the VW Caddy pick-up . The pick-up model also had a lifestyle edition named the Felicia Fun , ( Typ 796 ) conceived mostly for the Western European market . The rear screen section hinges out into the loadbay , allowing 2 extra seats to be folded out , giving comfortable seating for 4 adults . A tonneau cover is available to cover the rear seats , which are otherwise open to the elements . A Truckman top is also available which encloses the rear seats and loadbay , making for a more practical bad weather conversion . Luggage capacity in the hatchback was 272 litres with the rear seats in the upright position , and this increased to 976 litres with the rear seats folded . For the Combi ( estate version ) , this was 447 and 1,366 litres respectively . In 1998 , the Felicia and Felicia Combi received a minor facelift . The most obvious visual change was a redesigned radiator grille and larger bumpers , but changes also included minor upgrades to the chassis and bodyshell to improve crash safety . All internal combustion engines used in Felicia are inline four cylinder designs , operate on the four-stroke cycle , are fuel injected , and water cooled . The fundamental layout of the Felicia 's powertrain included engines mounted at the front of the vehicle , and orientated transversely . The line-up included the old 1.3 litre overhead valve ( OHV ) Å koda petrol engines , now with Bosch Mono Motronic single-point fuel injection ( up until 1997 ) , and Siemens multi-point fuel injection , with two rated power outputs of 40 k and 50 k. There was also two engines sourced from Volkswagen Group : a 55 k 1.6 litre petrol engine with Magneti Marelli multi-point fuel injection , and a 47 k 1.9 D diesel engine . The 1.6 litre model served as a homologation basis for the Å koda Felicia Kit Car used in the World Rally Championship 's F2 class . The only transmission was a five-speed manual gearbox , which was of a transaxle design , and contained the differential and final drive units . Drive was through the front wheels .

MiÅ sk Mazowiecki is a town in central Poland with 37 138 inhabitants ( XII 2005 ) . It is situated in the Masovian Voivodeship ( since 1999 ) , previously in Siedlce Voivodeship ( 1975 â `` 1998 ) . It is the capital of MiÅ sk County . The source of the name MiÅ sk is the River Mienia , whose name in turn derives from mieniÄ , which means â shineâ . The postnominal adjective Mazowiecki shows the historical connection to Mazovia and distinguishes MiÅ sk Mazowiecki from the Belarusian capital of Minsk . MiÅ sk Mazowiecki is located geographically in South Podlasie , historically in East Mazovia and administratively in East Masovian Voivodeship . More precisely , the city lies 40 km east from Warsaw 's Center . Until 1768 it was illegal for Jewish people to settle in MiÅ sk . But from 19th century to 1930s it was very popular . So , there were thousands of Jews before Second World War . They had a general synagogue and some smaller temples . Early after war began , Germans created the MiÅ sk Ghetto . It was closed in 1942 , July 21 . Most of the Jews were killed in Treblinka extermination camp ( thousands of people ) , and the rest were killed in MiÅ sk in 1943 , January 10 ( 500 people ) and June 5 ( last 150 Jews ) . The Polish Home Army managed to kill 2 German officers after this . Overall : 13,12 km sq .

The 1998 â `` 99 NHL season was the 82nd regular season of the National Hockey League . Twenty-seven teams played 82 games each . The Dallas Stars finished first in regular season play , and won the Stanley Cup championship over the Buffalo Sabres on an overtime goal by Brett Hull . With the addition of the expansion Nashville Predators , the NHL realigned this year to a strictly geographic six-division structure ( three per conference ) , erasing the last vestiges of the traditional four-division structure ( Adams\/Patrick\/Norris \/ Smythe ) abandoned in 1993 â `` 94 . Other than the necessary reassignment of Colorado to the Western Conference in 1995 due to its two-thousand mile ( over 3,200 km ) move west from Quebec , the divisions ' membership had remained static for five years despite the renaming and relocation of several franchises . As part of this realignment , the Toronto Maple Leafs moved from the Western Conference to the Eastern Conference . This put three of the ` Original Six ' teams in the Northeast Division ( Boston , Montreal , Toronto ) , and the three original cities of the NHL in the Northeast ( Montreal , Ottawa , Toronto ) . The Maurice ` Rocket ' Richard Trophy for the most goals by a player in a season made its debut this year . The first winner was Teemu Selanne of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim . The 1998 â `` 99 season marked the retirement of Wayne Gretzky , the NHL 's all-time leading scorer , who played his final three NHL seasons with the New York Rangers . The Rangers had been battling for a playoff spot up until the end of the regular season when they lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins , who were able to clinch a post-season berth when Jaromir Jagr scored the winning goal . This was the final season that Fox televised NHL games in the United States . It was also the final season for the Toronto Maple Leafs at Maple Leaf Gardens , before moving to the Air Canada Centre in February . Toronto also made its first post-season appearance since 1995 â `` 96 this season . 1998-99 was also the final year that the Carolina Hurricanes played at Greensboro Coliseum ; they moved to the brand-new Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena in Raleigh for the next season . The Colorado Avalanche played their fourth and final season at McNichols Sports Arena and would move to Pepsi Center the following season . Goaltenders continued to dominate the league , as only two teams , the Toronto Maple Leafs and the New Jersey Devils , averaged more than three goals scored per game . In addition , no player reached the 50-goal plateau . A total of 160 shutouts were recorded for the second-straight regular season . The teams split the first two games , held in Dallas , then split the following two games in Buffalo . In the fifth game , Dallas shut out Buffalo to put the Sabres on the brink of elimination . Game six was held in Buffalo and it went to triple-overtime before being decided on Brett Hull 's goal . Joe Nieuwendyk of Dallas was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoffs ' most valuable player .

Seal script ( Chinese : Simplified : ç ä ; Traditional : ç æ ; pinyin : zhuÃ nshÅ `` ) is an ancient style of Chinese calligraphy . It evolved organically out of the ZhÅ u dynasty script ( see bronze script ) , arising in the Warring State of Qin . The Qin variant of seal script became the standard and was adopted as the formal script for all of China in the Qin dynasty , and was still widely used for decorative engraving and seals ( name chops , or signets ) in the Han dynasty . Ever since , its predominant use has been in seals , hence the English name . The literal translation of its Chinese name ç ä ( zhuÃ nshÅ `` ) is decorative engraving script , because by the time this name was coined in the Han dynasty , its role had been reduced to decorational inscriptions rather than as the main script of the day . See East Asian Calligraphy for examples of seal script compared to modern Chinese script . Most people today can not read the seal script , so it is generally not used outside the fields of seals and calligraphy . There are two uses of the word seal script , the Large or Great Seal script ( å ç DÃ zhuÃ n ; Japanese daiten ) , and the lesser or Small Seal Script ( å ç XiÇ ozhuÃ n ; Japanese shÅ ten ) ; the latter is also called simply seal script . The Large Seal script was originally a later , vague Han dynasty reference to writing of the Qin system similar to but earlier than Small Seal . It has also been used to refer to Western Zhou forms or even oracle bones as well . Since the term is an imprecise one , not clearly referring to any specific historical script and not used with any consensus in meaning , modern scholars tend to avoid it , and when referring to seal script , generally mean the ( small ) seal script of the Qin system , that is , the lineage which evolved in the state of Qin during the Spring and Autumn to Warring States periods and which was standardized under the First Emperor . There were several different variants of seal script which developed in each kingdom independently during the warring state period and spring and autumn . The `` birds and worms '' script was used in the Kingdoms of Wu , Chu , and Yue . It was found on several artifacts including the Spear of Fuchai , and Sword of Goujian . On one side of the blade of Goujian , eight characters ( in two columns ) were written in an ancient script . The script was found to be the one called é è æ -- `` birds and worms characters '' ( owing to the intricate decorations to the defining strokes ) , a variant of zhuan that is very difficult to read . Initial analysis of the text deciphered six of the characters , '' è ç '' ( King of Yue ) and '' è ä 1\/2 ç '' å '' ( `` made this sword for ( his ) personal use '' ) . As a southern state , Chu was close to the Wu-Yue influences . Chu produced broad bronze swords that were similar to Wuyue swords , but not as intricate . Chu also used the Birds and Worms style , which was borrowed by the Wu and Yue states . The script of the Qin system ( the writing as exemplified in bronze inscriptions in the state of Qin before unification ) had evolved organically from the Zhou script starting in the Spring and Autumn period . Beginning around the Warring States period , it became vertically elongated with a regular appearance . This was the period of maturation of Small Seal script , also called simply seal script . It was systematized by Li Si æ æ -- during the reign of the First Emperor of China Qin Shi Huang through elimination of most variant structures , and was imposed as the nationwide standard ( thus banning other regional scripts ) , but small seal script was clearly not invented at that time . Through Chinese commentaries , it is known that Li Si compiled Cangjiepian å é ç , a non-extant work of character recognition listing some 3,300 Chinese characters in small seal script . Their form is characterized by being less rectangular and more squarish . In the popular history of Chinese characters , the Small Seal script is traditionally considered to be the ancestor of the clerical script é æ , which in turn gave rise to all of the other scripts in use today . However , recent archaeological discoveries and scholarship have led some scholars to conclude that the direct ancestor of clerical script was proto-clerical script , which in turn evolved out of the little-known vulgar or popular writing of the late Warring States to Qin period ( see Qiu Xigui , in references ) . The first known character dictionary was the 3rd century BC Erya ç 3\/4 é , collated and bibliographed by Liu Xiang å å ` and his son Liu Xin å æ , lost the pre-Han script during the course of textual transmission . Not long after however , the Shuowen Jiezi è æ -- è # å -- ( AD 100 -- 121 ) , the lifework of Xu Shen è æ 1\/4 Han Dynasty , was written . Its 9,353 entries reproduce the standardized small-seal script variant for each entry , and for some entries other pre-Han variants from the late Zhou era .

Campeche is one of the 31 states which , with the Federal District , comprise the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico . Located in Southeast Mexico , it is bordered by the states of YucatÃ n to the north east , Quintana Roo to the east , and Tabasco to the south west . To the south it is bordered by the PetÃ n department of Guatemala and to the west by the Gulf of Mexico . The area of Campeche is , and the population is only 822,441 inhabitants in 2010 . This makes Campeche one of the states with the lowest population densities in Mexico ( fifth behind Baja California Sur , Durango , Sonora , and Chihuahua ) . The capital city of the state is the city of San Francisco de Campeche , which was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO . In addition to the city of Campeche , the state of Campeche includes the cities of Ciudad del Carmen , ChampotÃ n , and EscÃ rcega , the towns of BolonchÃ n , CalkinÃ , DzitbalchÃ , HecelchakÃ n , HopelchÃ n , Lerma , Tenabo , and Sabancuy , and many ruins of the Maya civilization such as BecÃ n , Calakmul , Silvituc , Dzibilnocac , EdznÃ , Hocchob , HolactÃ n , RÃ o Bec , Uxul , Xicalango , Xpuhil , and Xtampak . Campeche derives from the name of the Mayan city of Kan pech , which became today 's San Francisco de Campeche . Campeche was home to the ancient Mayan culture . Their advanced cultural and scientific development made the Maya one of the most important pre-Hispanic cultures in Latin America . Many Maya ruins that still stand in Campeche , such as Calakmul , Chicanna , Becan , Edzna , Xpujil , Hormiguero , Balamku , and El Tigre , among many . The name Campeche has Maya origins , however its meaning has had different interpretations : the most accepted one is that Can means snake and Pech means tick , or `` Site of Ticks and Snakes '' ; this matches the sculpture of a large snake with a tick on its head found within one of its temples . When the Spaniards first landed on the coast of Campeche in 1517 , they were defeated several times by the local leader Moch Couoh . After his death and thanks to territorial conflicts among the indigenous groups , the Spaniards were able to take control and in 1540 gave the settlement the official name of Villa de San Francisco de Campeche to honor Francisco de Montejo , `` El Mozo '' . The polytheist religion of the Maya civilization , which controlled every aspect of their lives , made the evangelization process of the Spaniards specially difficult to achieve in Mayan territory . The new government readily took advantage of the geographical location of the port and this was soon reflected in a commercial boom . Salt ; timber ; and Palo de Tinta , timber from a tree called Tinta , were exported to foreign countries . This boom not only attracted the conquistadores , it attracted European pirates as well ; during the 17th century Campeche was attacked repeatedly by them until 1704 . In 1821 , at the end of the war for Independence , the new sovereign country was witness to political conflicts between liberals , conservatives , centralists and federalists . In a rebellion about federalism , from 1841 to 1848 Campeche , along with YucatÃ n and Quintana Roo states , broke away from Mexico , becoming the independent Republic of YucatÃ n. In 1847 an indigenous rebellion known as the `` Caste War '' began , with the Mayas rebelling against the `` white government '' to regain control of their land . The insurrection was mostly crushed with the help of the Mexican Army and the YucatÃ n Peninsula once again rejoined Mexico in 1848 ( although the Maya continued to resist until the early 20th century ) . The peninsula was also one of the regions in the country that rejected the imposition of a federal government . And to top it all , Campeche and YucatÃ n had economic conflicts between them at the same time . It wasnâ t until May 3 , 1858 that Campeche was formally separated from YucatÃ n. But it was only recognized as a sovereign region in 1863 by president Benito JuÃ rez . The state economy has been based on the exportation of timber and salt since the government of Porfirio DÃ az . Corn and sugar cane are the main agricultural products . In 1975 , the state 's economy was impelled by the discovery of an oil bed off its coasts in the Gulf of Mexico . The State of Campeche is divided into 11 municipalities , each headed by a municipal president ( mayor ) . Data from the II Conteo de PoblaciÃ n y Vivienda 2000 , INEGI .

Louis Alexandre Chiron ( born 3 August 1899 in Monte Carlo , Monaco â `` died there on 22 June 1979 ) was a Grand Prix driver . As a teenager , Louis Chiron fell in love with cars and racing . He learned to drive at a young age and joined the Grand Prix circuit after World War I where he had been requisitioned from the artillery section to serve as a chauffeur . Competing in France , in 1926 he won his first local race , taking the Grand Prix de Comminges at Saint-Gaudens near the city of Toulouse . From there , Chiron went on to drive a Bugatti and an Alfa Romeo P3 to important wins in the Marseille Grand Prix , the Circuit of Masaryk , and the Spanish Grand Prix . In addition , he teamed up with champion marathon driver Luigi Chinetti to win the 1933 Spa 24 hours endurance race in Belgium . He also drove a Delage to 7th place in the 1929 Indianapolis 500 . He won the 1931 Monaco Grand Prix , and As of 2010 he is the only Monaco-born driver to have done so . Louis Chiron 's career came to an end with his retirement in 1938 and auto racing itself a year later with the outbreak of World War II . When racing resumed after the War , Chiron made a comeback and drove a Talbot-Lago to victory in two French Grand Prix races . In 1949 , the first Monte Carlo Rally after World War II took place and a large celebration party was given in Monaco . In what is now regarded as one of the black moments of Chiron 's life , at the party , in front of numerous race organizers , race drivers , and celebrities , Chiron denounced the female driver HellÃ Nice by declaring that she had been an agent of the Gestapo during the war . ( This has an ironic cast , in that the lure of a superior car led Chiron to lend his skill to the Mercedes-Benz team , which the Nazis were using as an object of propaganda for their philosophy of racial superiority , at a time when his Jewish colleague and rival RenÃ Dreyfus could not ) . His unsubstantiated allegation destroyed Nice 's life and she would be shunned by all , dying in abject poverty . By the time the new Formula One circuit was organized for the 1950 racing season , age was beginning to catch up with him but he still won the 1954 Monte Carlo Rally paired with Swiss racedriver Ciro Basadonna . In F1 racing , Chiron did manage a podium finish in his fifteen races and in 1955 , in front of a hometown Monte Carlo crowd , a few weeks before his 56th birthday he became the oldest driver to compete in a Formula One race . To the applause of Prince Rainier and his many fans he guided his Lancia D50 to a sixth place finish in the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix . After a remarkable 35 years in racing , on his retirement Chiron still remained active as an executive with the organization running the Monaco Grand Prix who honored him with a statue erected along the Grand Prix racecourse and named one of the track 's curves for him . Louis Chiron held the most podiums in Bugatti cars , and the 21st Century Bugatti company remembered him with the Bugatti 18\/3 Chiron named in his honor . Louis Chiron is also known for being the oldest driver who has ever taken part in a Formula One Grand Prix . In his last F1 race , the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix , he was 58 years old . Louis Chiron was so popular in Czechoslovakia whose Grand Prix he won three consecutive times that even after 75 years his name still lives in a popular saying `` He drives likes Chiron '' , used mainly when referring to speeding motorists or generally to people who drive very fast .

Vibrio is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria possessing a curved rod shape , several species of which can cause foodborne infection , usually associated with eating undercooked seafood . Typically found in saltwater , Vibrio are facultative anaerobes that test positive for oxidase and do not form spores . All members of the genus are motile and have polar flagella with sheaths . Recent phylogenies have been constructed based on a suite of genes ( multi-locus sequence analysis ) . The name Vibrio derives from Filippo Pacini who isolated microorganisms he called `` vibrions '' from cholera patients in 1854 . Several species of Vibrio are pathogens . Most disease causing strains are associated with gastroenteritis but can also infect open wounds and cause septicemia . It can be carried by numerous sea-living animals , such as crabs or prawns , and has been known to cause fatal infections in humans during exposure . Pathogenic Vibrio include V. cholerae ( the causative agent of cholera ) , V. parahemolyticus , and V. vulnificus . Vibrio cholerae is generally transmitted via contaminated water . Pathogenic Vibrio can cause foodborne infection , usually associated with eating undercooked seafood . Vibrio vulnificus outbreaks commonly occur in warm climates and small , generally lethal , outbreaks occur regularly . An outbreak occurred in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and several lethal cases occur most years in Florida . V. parahemolyticus is also associated with the Kanagawa phenomenon , in which strains isolated from human hosts ( clinical isolates ) are hemolytic on blood agar plates , while those isolated from non-human sources are non-hemolytic . Many Vibrio are also zoonotic . They cause disease in fish and shellfish , and are common causes of mortality among domestic marine life . Vibrio fischeri , Photobacterium phosphoreum , and V. harveyi are notable for their ability to communicate . Both V. fischeri and Ph. phosphoreum are symbiotes of other marine organisms ( typically jellyfish , fish , or squid ) , and produce light via bioluminescence through the mechanism of quorum sensing . Vibrio harveyi is a pathogen of several aquatic animals and notable as a cause of luminous vibriosis in shrimps ( prawns ) The `` typical '' , early-discovered Vibrio such as V. cholerae have a single polar flagellum ( monotrichous ) with sheath . Some species such as V. parahemolyticus and V. alginolyticus have both a single polar flagellum with sheath and thin flagella projecting in all directions ( peritrichous ) , and the other species such as V. fischeri have tufts of polar flagella with sheath ( lophotrichous ) .
A trench coat or trenchcoat is a raincoat made of waterproof heavy-duty cotton drill or poplin , wool gabardine , or leather . It generally has a removable insulated lining ; and it is usually knee-length . The trench coat was developed as an alternative to the heavy serge greatcoats worn by British and French soldiers in the First World War . Invention of the trench coat is claimed by both Burberry and Aquascutum , with Aquascutum 's claim dating back to the 1850s . Thomas Burberry , the inventor of gabardine fabric , submitted a design for an army officer 's raincoat to the United Kingdom War Office in 1901 . The trench coat became an optional item of dress in the British Army , and was obtained by private purchase by officers and Warrant Officers Class I who were under no obligation to own them . No other ranks were permitted to wear them . Another optional item was the British Warm , a wool coat similar to the greatcoat that was shorter in length , also worn by British officers and Warrant Officers Class I as an optional piece . During the First World War , the design of the trenchcoat was modified to include shoulder straps and D-rings . The shoulder straps were for the attachment of epaulettes or other rank insignia ; There is a popular myth that the D-ring was for the attachment of hand grenades . The ring was originally for map cases and swords or other equipment to the belt . This latter pattern was dubbed `` trench coat '' by the soldiers in the front line . Many veterans returning to civilian life kept the coats that became fashionable for both men and women . During the Second World War , officers of the United Kingdom continued to use the trench coat on the battlefield in inclement weather . Other nations also developed trench coat style jackets , notably the United States and Soviet Union , and other armies of continental Europe such as France , Germany , Holland , Poland ( and are often seen in war zone photographs in the 1939-40 era , even worn by troops on the attack ) , although as the war progressed , in the field shorter `` field jackets '' became more popular , including garments such as the Denison smock used by British commandos , paratroopers , and snipers and the M1941\/M1943 field jackets used by the US Army . These garments were shorter and more practical than the trench coat , and as such they allowed the wearer to be more mobile . A typical trench coat by this period was a ten-buttoned , double-breasted long coat made with tan , khaki , beige , or black fabric . Trench coats often have cuff straps on the raglan sleeves , shoulder straps and a belt . The trench coat was typically worn as a windbreaker or as a rain jacket , and not for protection from the cold in winter or snowy conditions . Trench coats have remained fashionable in the decades following World War II . Their original role as part of an army officer 's uniform lent the trench coat a businesslike respectability , whilst fictional heroes as diverse as the Tenth Doctor , Dick Tracy , Mike Hammer , Jack Harkness , The Crow , The Phantom , Humphrey Bogart 's Rick Blaine from Casablanca and Peter Sellers ' Inspector Clouseau kept the coat in the public eye . Usually , a fedora or an ushanka ( during colder weather ) was also worn . In the 1960s , some Mods wore trenchcoats as fashionable overcoats , as an alternative to the fishtail parka or crombie . The heavy metal and Goth fashion trend of black oilcloth dusters are usually referred to as trench coats . Early media reports of the Columbine High School massacre initially associated the perpetrators with members of the `` Trenchcoat Mafia '' , a group of outcasts who allegedly wore conspicuous black Australian oilcloth dusters . In the copycat W. R. Myers High School shooting days later , the shooter wore a trench coat . In the wake of these incidents , several schools forbade students to wear trench coats , on the grounds that the long coats could be used to conceal weapons .

Veurne is a municipality in the Belgian province of West Flanders . The municipality comprises the town of Veurne proper and the settlements of Avekapelle , Booitshoeke , Bulskamp , De Moeren , Eggewaartskapelle , Houtem , Steenkerke , Vinkem , Wulveringem , and Zoutenaaie . Veurne , in Latin Furna , is first found in 877 as a possession of the Saint Bertin Abbey in Saint-Omer . Around 890 AD , it was noted as a fortification against the Viking raids . It soon was placed at the head of the castellany of Veurne , a large territory counting 42 parishes and some 8 half-independent parishes , , owing allegiance to the Count of Flanders . Veurne became a city in the 12th century . During the following century , trade with England flourished . In 1270 , however , the relations with England came to a standstill and the cityâ s economy went into a long decline ; hence the nickname of the Veurne Sleepers . On August 20 , 1297 , the Battle of Veurne was fought in the ongoing struggle between the Flemish cities and the French king . The beautiful gothic church of Saint Walburga and the tower of the church of Saint Nicolas , date from that period . Saint Walburga housed a chapter of canons . Saint Nicholas and Saint Denis ( gone 18th century ) were the two other parish churches and possessions of the Norbertine abbey of Saint Nicholas . The 15th century saw the construction of a new city hall , which is known today as the Pavilion of the Spanish officers , from its use in the 17th century as military headquarters . As most of the `` Westhoek '' ( the Western part of the county of Flanders ) , the city and the neighbourghood strongly recessed during the economic and religious problems around 1566 â `` 1583 . But when the town and the castellany officially got together , the town flourished , thanks to the expanding agriculture of the agraric region . Most of the other historic buildings date from this time , the prosperous reign of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella around 1600 . In 1644 the Capucines organised a procession . Since 1646 , this procession was organised by the `` Sodales '' , a religious confraternity , that organised a crossway during Advent time , under the leadership of the Norbertine monk Jacob Clou . The hooded `` Sodales '' took a cross for penitence . This procession was expanded at the end of the 17th century with scenes from the Bible , and is the only one of his kind , remaining up to now in Flanders . The second half of the 17th century was marked by the miseries brought to the region by Louis XIVâ s wars . Vauban built heavy fortifications around the city , the outlines of which are still noticeable from the air today . Joseph II of Austria put them down and closed some of the religious institutions , putting a temporary end to the penitentsâ procession , until Leopold II allowed it again in 1790 . Those few cloisters that were still operating were closed at the French Revolution . From the Battle of Waterloo until World War I , Veurne could enjoy a century of quiet and prosperity . In 1830 , Veurne was the first city to welcome Belgiumâ s new king , Leopold I , in his new country . The railway was made on demand of Robert Stephenson as a passway to Dunkerque and so to England . During World War I , Veurne was located within the Yser pocket of Belgian resistance against the German troops . During the Battle of the Yser , the Veurne city hall became the headquarters for the Belgian troops under King Albert I and a military hospital was set up in the city . In 1920 , French President PoincarÃ came to Veurne to award the city the Croix de guerre with palm . Veurne suffered some damage during World War II , mainly from allied bombing but also from the strategic flooding that engulfed the whole area . Today , the city is a regional center , which gives commercial , medical , and educational services to the surrounding communities while enjoying increasing tourist attention . NAVO-Toren is a 243 metres tall guyed mast used for meteorological research and radio relay links . The annual Boeteprocessie ( procession of the penitents ) takes place every year on the last Sunday of July . This unique event includes cross-carrying , hooded penitents and other groups of participants who recreate the Passion of Jesus . The municipality of Veurne comprises 11 `` deelgemeentes '' . Veurne proper is the largest center and has the largest population . The others are small rural villages : Avekapelle , Booitshoeke , Bulskamp , De Moeren , Eggewaartskapelle , Houtem , Steenkerke , Vinkem , Wulveringem and Zoutenaaie .
The Toba Kakar Mountains are a Southern offshoot of the Himalayas in the Balochistan region of Pakistan . The historical route through the mountains is known as the Bolan Pass . The mountains originally received media attention in August , 1979 ; when evidence emerged that Pakistan may be using them as a potential workspace towards development of nuclear weapons . Again in April , 1981 , the United States government raised concerns , this time with Senator Alan Cranston referring specifically to a nuclear test site , built into the side of the mountains , 40 kilometres from Afghanistan . As a result of this , Congress amended existing legislation that would terminate finanicial assistance to Pakistan in the event of any nuclear test , so that it could not be waived by the President . In late 2004 , John Lehman announced that the United States now had the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden narrowed down to a 16-square kilometre area in the Toba Kakar mountains ; though they were hesitant to enter the area , Lehman using the reference that it would be `` another Vietnam '' . Pakistan 's Major General Shaukat Sultan commented the claims of bin Laden being in that mountain range were `` ridiculous '' and without basis .
Ryunosuke Okamoto ( born 9 October 1984 ) is a Japanese football player . He plays for Osaka .
The Nihon Shoki , sometimes translated as The Chronicles of Japan , is the second oldest book of classical Japanese history . It is more elaborate and detailed than the Kojiki , the oldest , and has proven to be an important tool for historians and archaeologists as it includes the most complete extant historical record of ancient Japan ( its beginning must be considered as largely mythological however ; its very first chapters , moreover , root in Chinese metaphysics ) . The Nihon Shoki was finished in 720 under the editorial supervision of Prince Toneri and with the assistance of Å no Yasumaro . The book is also called the Nihongi . The Nihon Shoki begins with the creation myth ( myth ) , explaining the origin of the world and the first seven generations of divine beings ( starting with Kunitokotachi ) , and goes on with a number of myths as does the Kojiki , but continues its account through to events of the 8th century . It is believed to record accurately the latter reigns of Emperor Tenji , Emperor Temmu and Empress JitÅ . The Nihon Shoki focuses on the merits of the virtuous rulers as well as the errors of the bad rulers . It describes episodes from mythological eras and diplomatic contacts with other countries . The Nihon Shoki was written in classical Chinese , as was common for official documents at that time . The Kojiki , on the other hand , is written in a combination of Chinese and phonetic transcription of Japanese ( primarily for names and songs ) . The Nihon Shoki also contains numerous transliteration notes telling the reader how words were pronounced in Japanese . Collectively , the stories in this book and the Kojiki are referred to as the Kiki stories . One of the stories that first appear in the Nihon Shoki is the tale of Urashima TarÅ , which has been identified as the earliest example of a story involving time travel . Shoku Nihongi notes that '' å æ ä å `` è ä è ç å å ä æ -- æ ç ã è æ å æ å ä ã ç å å ç '' å -- ä å '' in the part of May , 720 . It means `` Up to that time , Prince Toneri had been compiling Nihongi on the orders of the emperor ; he completed it , submitting 30 volumes of history and one volume of genealogy '' . The volume of genealogy is no longer extant . The process of compilation is usually studied by stylistic analysis of each chapter . Although written in classical Chinese , some sections use styles characteristic of Japanese editors , while others seem to be written by native speakers of Chinese . According to recent studies , most of the chapters after # 14 ( Emperor YÅ `` ryaku chronicle ) were contributed by native Chinese , except for Chapters 22 and 23 ( the Suiko and Jomei chronicle ) . Also , as Chapter 13 ends with the phrase `` see details of the incident in the chronicle of Å hastuse ( YÅ `` ryaku ) Emperor '' referring to the assassination of Emperor AnkÅ , it is assumed that this chapter was written after the compilation of subsequent chapters . Some believe Chapter 14 was the first to be completed . =
Hilary James Wedgwood Benn ( born 26 November 1953 ) is a British Labor Party politician who has been the Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Leeds Central since 1999 . He served in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for International Development from 2003 to 2007 and as the Secretary of State for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs from 2007 to 11 May 2010 . Since October 2010 , Benn has been the Shadow Leader of the House of Commons . In June 2007 , Benn ran for the deputy leadership of the Labor Party , placing fourth behind Harriet Harman , Alan Johnson and Jon Cruddas . Born in Hammersmith , London , Hilary Benn is a fourth generation MP as the second son of former Labor Cabinet Minister Tony Benn and educationalist Caroline Benn . He attended Norland Place School , Westminster Under School ( a private school ) , Holland Park School and University of Sussex where he graduated in Russian and East European Studies . Benn has an older brother , Stephen , a younger sister Melissa and a younger brother , Joshua . On leaving university , Benn became a Research Officer with the ASTMS and rose to become Head of Policy for Manufacturing Science and Finance . In 1979 he was elected to the Ealing Borough Council where he was Deputy Leader from 1986 to 1990 . He was the Labor candidate for Ealing North in both the 1983 general election and 1987 general election . On both occasions he was defeated by the Conservative candidate Harry Greenway . When Labor won power in 1997 , Benn was appointed Special Adviser to David Blunkett as Secretary of State for Education and Employment . In 1999 he was quickly selected as the Labor candidate for the Leeds Central by-election following the death of Derek Fatchett . Benn won the by-election on 10 June 1999 on a very small turnout , by just over 2,000 votes . He made his maiden speech on 23 June 1999 . Benn was the bookmakers ' favorite for the Deputy Leadership of the Labor Party . The early polls in the Deputy Leadership contest showed him to be the grassroots ' favorite - in a YouGov poll of party members , Benn was top on 27 % , followed by Education Secretary Alan Johnson on 18 % , Environment Secretary David Miliband on 17 % , Justice Minister Harriet Harman on 10 % , and Labor Party Chair Hazel Blears on 7 % . The contest was formally launched on 14 May 2007 after the resignation of incumbent Deputy leader John Prescott , Benn had some initial difficulties securing the necessary 45 nominations required to get on the ballot paper but he acquired the support needed to join five other candidates - Hazel Blears , Harriet Harman , Alan Johnson , Peter Hain and backbencher Jon Cruddas . Supporting nominations from constituency Labor Parties showed Hilary Benn obtaining 25 % , Jon Cruddas 22 % , Harriet Harman 19 % , Alan Johnson 14 % , Hazel Blears 12 % and Peter Hain 8 % of the constituency parties that voted . The Labor leadership contest closed on Sunday 24 June 2007 with Harriet Harman winning the contest . Benn was eliminated in the 3rd round of voting having reached a total of 22.33 % of the votes . Harriet Harman was elected in the 5th round with 50.43 % of the vote . As Secretary of State for the Environment , Food and Rural Affairs , it was the responsibility of Hilary Benn to respond to the threat to UK cattle from Mycobacterium bovis , colloquially referred to as Bovine Tuberculosis ( TB ) . The recommended option from the Chief Scientific Advisor until 2007 , Sir David King , was a badger cull . That was one factor that I was bound to take into account in reaching my decision , because there are strong views on all sides and public opinion can have an impact on the practicality of a cull . It was entirely legitimate for that to be one of the factors that I weighed up in my mind , but above all the decision has been taken as a result of the science . In April 2010 , a badger cull was announced in Wales , after the high court in Cardiff rejected a legal challenge from The Badger Trust . Hilary Benn was picked out by several national newspapers as one of only three senior members of the Labor Party to have presented expenses beyond reproach . `` When all Westminster MPs ' total expenditures are ranked , Benn 's bill is the 15th least expensive for the taxpayer , '' said The Guardian . Relating to the huge amounts of food wasted ( according to WRAP 33 % of all food produced ) , Hilary Benn launched the `` War on Waste '' program to reduce this amount . Whilst Benn proposed to scrap the `` best before '' date altogether , others proposed enhancing the validity date with other solutions such as Time temperature indicators . In 1973 , whilst at university , he married fellow student Rosalind Retey , who died of cancer at age 26 in 1979 ; Benn subsequently married Sally Christina Clark in 1982 . He has four children , Michael , James , Jonathan and Caroline . He and his family live in Chiswick , West London . Benn strongly resembles his father , Tony Benn , in his speaking style and delivery , but is a political centrist and New Labor loyalist . It is in this vein that he famously describes himself as `` a Benn , but not a Bennite '' . Like his father , he is a teetotaller and a vegetarian .
Combat , or fighting , is a purposeful violent conflict meant to establish dominance over the opposition . The term combat ( French for fight ) typically refers to armed conflict between military forces in warfare , whereas the more general term `` fighting '' can refer to any violent conflict . Combat violence can be unilateral , whereas fighting implies at least a defensive reaction . However , the terms are often used synonymously along with the term `` Battle Ready '' . A large-scale fight is known as a battle . Combat may take place under a certain set of rules or be unregulated . Examples of rules include the Geneva Conventions ( covering the treatment of soldiers in war ) , medieval Chivalry , the Marquess of Queensberry rules ( covering boxing ) and several forms of combat sports . Combat in warfare involves two or more opposing military organizations , usually fighting for nations at war ( although guerrilla warfare and suppression of insurgencies can fall outside this definition ) . Warfare falls under the laws of war , which govern its purposes and conduct , and protect the rights of soldiers and non-combatants . Combat may be armed ( using weapons ) , or unarmed ( not using weapons ) . Hand-to-hand combat ( melee ) is combat at very close range , attacking the opponent with the body ( striking , kicking , strangling , etc. ) and\/or with a melee weapon ( knives , swords , batons , etc. ) , as opposed to a ranged weapon . Certain speech act structures related to verbal and also physical exchanges are extant in ancient times as well as today . Fixed speech act patterns employed in a verbal exchange are a phenomenon found in historical and modern texts alike . Although conventions change over time and from one culture to the other , ritualised exchanges seem to be part of the basic inventory of language usage , and so it is quite common to find similarities between the way individuals from various cultures engage in a verbal duel . Verbal combat may result in physical combat after a certain extent .
The Weather Makers : The History and Future Impact of Climate Change ( 2005 ) is a book by Tim Flannery . The book received critical acclaim . It won the major prize at the 2006 New South Wales Premier 's Literary Awards , and was short-listed for the 2010 Jan Michalski Prize for Literature . The book includes 36 short essays predicting the consequences of global warming . The book reviews evidence of historical climate change and attempts to compare this with the current era . The book argues that if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels continue to increase at current rates , the resulting climate change will cause mass species extinctions . The book also asserts that global temperatures have already risen enough to cause the annual monsoon rains in the Sahel region of Africa to diminish , causing droughts and desertification . This in turn , according to Flannery , has caused the conflict in the Darfur region through competition for disappearing resources . Further consequences , argued in the book , include increasing hurricane intensity , and decline in the health of coral reefs . The final third of the book discusses proposed solutions . Flannery advocates individual action as well as international and governmental actions . He argues that a few industries such as the coal industry , currently responsible for 40 % of the energy consumed in the U.S. , remain opponents of needed action . The book retraces the evidence that the administration , motivated by coal-industry donations to the Republican party , undermines political action by omitting mention of climate change from government documents . The book cites evidence against the argument that conservation is bad for economies .
In everyday speech , a phrase may refer to any group of words . In linguistics , a phrase is a group of words which form a constituent and so function as a single unit in the syntax of a sentence . A phrase is lower on the grammatical hierarchy than a clause . For example , the house at the end of the street is a phrase . It acts like a noun . It can further be broken down into two shorter phrases functioning as adjectives : at the end and of the street , a shorter prepositional phrase within the longer prepositional phrase . At the end of the street could be replaced by an adjective such as nearby : the nearby house or even the house nearby . The end of the street could also be replaced by another noun , such as the crossroads to produce the house at the crossroads . Most phrases have an important word defining the type and linguistic features of the phrase . This word is the head of the phrase and gives its name to the phrase category . For example the phrase the massive dinosaur is a noun phrase because its head word ( dinosaur ) is a noun . The head can be distinguished from its dependents ( the rest of the phrase other than the head ) because the head of the phrase determines many of the grammatical features of the phrase as a whole . A complex phrase consists of several words , whereas a simple phrase consists of only one word . This terminology is especially often used with verb phrases : `` Complex , '' which is phrase-level , is often confused with `` compound '' , which is word-level . However , there are certain phenomena that formally seem to be phrases but semantically are more like compounds , such as `` women 's magazines , '' which has the form of a possessive noun phrase , but which refers ( just like a compound ) to one specific lexeme ( i.e. a magazine for women and not a magazine owned by a woman ) . In more semiotic approaches to language , such as the more cognitivist versions of construction grammar , a phrasal structure is not only a certain formal combination of word types whose features are inherited from the head . Here each phrasal structure also expresses some type of conceptual content , be it specific or abstract .
The last members of the class were withdrawn in 1991 , and none were preserved . The Class 129 was a class of single-car Diesel Multiple Unit built in 1955 for British Rail . Only three were built by Cravens and were introduced in 1958 . The class was built for parcels traffic like the Class 128 . One unit ( 55997 ) survived into departmental service being named ` Hydra ' . The driving ends of a Class 129 car bore a visible similarity to that of the British Rail Class 105 . Single car unit No : RDB 975385 ( formerly a Cravens parcels car No : M55997 ) was converted as a test bed for hydrostatic drive in 1980 and was known as ` Laboratory 9 Hydra ' . It was fitted hydrostatic transmission having the normal Leyland 680 six cylinder engine driving two Rexroth Hydromatic axial piston pumps . Each pump supplied fluid to a Volvo fixed displacement compact axle-end motor which drove the axle directly . The maximum system pressure was in the order of 400 bar . This arrangement was only fitted to one bogie , the other one retaining its normal drive but with the cardan shaft disconnected .
The Venus of Tan-Tan is an alleged artifact found in Morocco . It is 6 centimeters long quartzite rock , and has been interpreted as a depiction of the human form , gender indeterminate and faceless , dated between 300,000 and 500,000 years ago . It was discovered in 1999 , during an archaeological survey by Lutz Fiedler , state archaeologist of Hesse , Germany , in a river terrace deposit on the north bank of the Draa River a few kilometers south of the Moroccan town of Tan-Tan . It and its contemporary , the Venus of Berekhat Ram , have been claimed as the earliest representations of the human form . There is some controversy amongst archaeologists as to its nature and origin . To its discoverer and others , e.g. , Robert Bednarik , the object had a general human-like shape that was accentuated by carving it with a stone-wedge ; some artificial smudge stains are interpreted as remnants of red ochre pigments used by humans to further accentuate the human-like form . For others , for instance Professor Stanley Ambrose of the University of Illinois , Urbana-Champaign , the rock 's shape is just the result of natural weathering and erosion , which coincidentally produced a remotely human-like object , i.e. , a geofact .

In the United States , Patriot Day occurs on September 11 of each year , designated in memory of the 2,977 killed in the September 11 , 2001 attacks . Most Americans refer to the day as `` Nine-Eleven ( 9\/11 ) , '' `` September Eleventh , '' or some variation thereof . Initially , the day was called the Prayer and Remembrance for the Victims of the Terrorist Attacks on September 11 , 2001 . U.S. House of Representatives Joint Resolution 71 was approved by a vote of 407 â `` 0 on October 25 , 2001 . It requested that the President designate September 11 of each year as `` Patriot Day . '' President George W. Bush signed the resolution into law on December 18 , 2001 ( as Public Law 107-89 ) . It is a discretionary day of remembrance . On September 4 , 2002 , President Bush used his authority created by the resolution and proclaimed September 11 , 2002 as Patriot Day . On this day , the President directs that the American flag be flown at half-staff at individual American homes , at the White House , and on all U.S. government buildings and establishments , home and abroad . The President also asks Americans to observe a moment of silence beginning at 8:46 A.M. ( Eastern Daylight Time ) , the time the first plane struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11 , 2001 .

Origanum is a genus of about 20 species of aromatic herbs in the family Lamiaceae , native to the Mediterranean region east to eastern Asia . The genus includes some important culinary herbs , including Marjoram and Oregano . Origanum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Coleophora albitarsella .
A boyfriend is a person 's regular male companion in a romantic and\/or sexual relationship , though normally not in long-term committed ( e.g. marital ) relationships , where other titles ( e.g. husband , partner ) are more commonly used . The term `` guy friend '' can refer to a male non-romantic and non-sexual friend . Partners in such non-marital relationships are also sometimes described as a significant other , life partner or simply partner , especially if the individuals are cohabiting . At times , since `` boyfriend '' and `` partner '' mean different things to different people , the distinctions between the terms are subjective . How the term is used will ultimately be determined by personal preference . In 20th century United States , women were often interviewed by `` gentleman callers '' , single men who would arrive at the home of a young woman with the hopes of beginning a courtship . Though nuanced , there is a significant difference between girlfriend and boyfriend on one hand , and girl friend and boy friend on the other . In a strictly grammatical sense , a girlfriend or boyfriend is an ` individual of significance ' with whom one shares a relationship . In the past it had implications of an illicit relationship ( as sexual and romantic relationships outside marriage were generally frowned upon ) . It is now a generally accepted term , no longer having negative connotations . An earlier usage in print , dating from July 1889 , is discussed in Neil Bartlett 's , Who Was That Man ? A Present for Mr Oscar Wilde . On pages 108-110 , Bartlett quotes from an issue of The Artist and Journal of Home Culture , which refers to Alectryon as `` a boyfriend of Mars '' .
Landes , or Lanas in Gascon , means moorland or heath . Landes and Lanas come from the Latin plÄ nus meaning â â flat , even , level , plainâ â . They are therefore cognate with the English plain ( and plane ) , the Spanish word llanos and the Italian word piano .
Donnchad mac MaÃ l Coluim ( Modern Gaelic : Donnchadh mac Mhaoil Chaluim ; anglicised as Duncan II ; before c. 1060 -- 12 November 1094 ) was king of Scots . He was son of Malcolm III ( MÃ el Coluim mac Donnchada ) and his first wife Ingibiorg Finnsdottir , widow of Thorfinn Sigurdsson . Duncan was given into the keeping of William I of England in 1072 as a hostage , and spent many years at court , where he was exposed to the newly arrived Norman culture . His father , who had many sons , appears to have made no effort to obtain Duncan 's return . By the reign of William II , Duncan was probably a member of the Norman court rather than a hostage , and he was knighted by the English King . His father 's chosen successor was Duncan 's half-brother Edward , who died in the same combat during the invasion of Northumbria in 1093 as did Malcolm III . Malcolm was succeeded by his brother Donalbane ( Domnall BÃ n mac Donnchada ) , who reigned as Donald III , and Malcolm 's other sons joined their half-brother Duncan in England . Duncan received William II 's tacit support for the Scottish kingship , but the English king did not extend direct support , as he planned a campaign in Normandy . It is probably in the period 1093 -- 1094 that Duncan married Uchtreda of Northumbria , daughter of Gospatric , Earl of Dunbar and Northumbria , although an earlier betrothal has been proposed . Accompanied by his Anglo-Norman followers , and perhaps by the elder of his half-brothers , Duncan easily defeated Donalbane in the early summer of 1094 , but appears to have had little support north of the Forth , being reliant on his Northumbrian , English and Norman allies . A revolt later in 1094 was directed against Duncan 's followers rather than the new king , but many of the Normans were killed and the rest sent away in order to settle the revolt . Donalbane 's supporters appear to have rallied again , and Duncan was murdered late in 1094 by MÃ el Petair , Mormaer of Mearns . He was buried at Dunfermline Abbey . His son by Uchtreda , William fitz Duncan , was a prominent figure during the reigns of Duncan 's half-brothers Alexander and David .

19521 Chaos , is a cubewano , a Kuiper belt object not in resonance with any planet . Chaos was discovered in 1998 by the Deep Ecliptic Survey , with Kitt Peak 's 4 m telescope . Assuming it has an albedo of 0.09 , the absolute magnitude ( H ) of 4.9 would make it about 460 km in diameter . It is named after the primeval state of existence in Greek mythology , from which the first gods appeared .
`` Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin-Geddon '' was the first official single released by Marilyn Manson from their May 29 , 2009 album The High End of Low . It is set to have a remix by the Teddybears . The song was released for download on May 5 , 2009 , along with the pre-order of The High End of Low . Marilyn Manson says about the song on June 's Revolver issue : Itâ s the song that I 100 % , absolutely would never believe a record company would want to release as a single . Half the point of writing it was just to piss them off . Thatâ s the type of thing that comes out of my mouth on a regular basis . Some people think I have a chromosome disorder in my brain , so I make up words and phrases that are ridiculous . I say itâ s a â superhero special feature . '' The Slipknot remix will also be released as an exclusive download through Play.com when the album is bought with that retailer . Metal Hammer describes `` Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon '' as having `` Heavy basslines , a stomping back-beat and a very traditionally Manson glam-chorus are the order of the day . It 's this glam rock tinge that really shines through on the track , nodding to his penchant for decadent 70 's rock but with an old school Manson industrial shade . He may not be as dangerous as he once appeared but it is good to hear Mazza using one of those many middle fingers he was born with once again . '' Thrash Hits gave the song a positive review , saying '' â Arma-Goddamn-Motherfucking-Geddon â rides Ramirezâ s rubbery honk of a bassline into a fist-pumping , glam-stomp of a chorus , '' and included it as one of the top tracks of the album . Behind the scene photos of the video being filmed show that the video may be similar to the Antichrist Superstar video\/live performances . Showing Manson singing at a podium only instead of the shock symbol it seems to show what resembles a dollar sign . The video was directed by Delaney Bishop . On May 14 , the video premiered on NME.com . On May 28 , 2009 , the edited version of the video was available for download on iTunes . In August 2009 , the `` Director 's Cut '' version appeared on Delaney Bishop 's blog .

Vilcabamba ( from Quechua : Willkapampa , `` sacred plain '' ) was a city founded by Manco Inca in 1539 and was the last refuge of the Inca Empire until it fell to the Spaniards in 1572 , signaling the end of Inca resistance to Spanish rule . After the Incan empire fell , the city was burned and the area swiftly became a remote , secluded spot of Peru . The location of Vilcabamba was forgotten . The first outsiders in modern times to come to the remote forest site that has since come to be identified with Vilcabamba la Vieja were three CuzqueÃ os : Manuel Ugarte , Manuel Lopez Torres , and Juan Cancio Saavedra , in 1892 . The site of the ruins of the city were then rediscovered by Hiram Bingham in 1911 at the remote forest site 130 k west of Cuzco called EspÃ ritu Pampa , and are written of in his classic Lost City of the Incas . Yet , he failed to realize its significance , preferring to believe that Machu Picchu , which he also rediscovered , was the fabled `` Vilcabamba , '' lost city and last refuge of the Incas . It was n't until the explorations and discoveries of Antonio Santander Casselli , and Gene Savoy in the 1960s , however , that many came to see this site at EspÃ ritu Pampa as the real Vilcabamba of legend . It was the reporting of the finds of Savoy and his 1970 book , Antisuyo , that brought the site to wider attention . Researcher and author John Hemming provided additional substantive confirmation as to EspÃ ritu Pampa 's significance in his 1970 The Conquest of the Incas . In 1976 Prof. Edmundo Guillen and Polish explorers Tony Halik and ElÅ 1\/4 bieta Dzikowska continued to explore the long-known ruins . However , before the expedition , Guillen visited a museum in Seville where he discovered letters from Spaniards , in which they were describing the progress of the invasion and what they found in Vilcabamba . Comparison between the letters ' content and the ruins provided additional proof of the location of Vilcabamba . In 1981 the party of American explorer Gregory Deyermenjian reached and photographed parts of the site , soon thereafter generating a popular article concerning the site and its history . Later extensive archeological work by Vincent Lee , and especially his exhaustive study , his 2000 book Forgotten Vilcabamba , gave further and even more precise confirmation that has made EspÃ ritu Pampa the definitively accepted site of the historical Vilcabamba . On June 16 , 2006 a museum in Cuzco unveiled a plaque that commemorates the thirtieth anniversary of the 1976 Vilcabamba findings . The lost city of Vilcabamba features in the educational computer game series The Amazon Trail , the Tomb Raider videogame and its remake Tomb Raider : Anniversary , and the books Evil Star and Necropolis by British thriller author Anthony Horowitz . Vilcabamba is also a playable place in the PlayStation 2 RPG Shadow Hearts : From the New World . The city was the location of British writer Colin Thubron 's 2002 novel , To the Last City ( 2002 ) , which was short-listed for the Man Booker Prize , and tells the story of a group of people who set off to explore the ruins of the Inca city in what has been described as a `` Heart of Darkness narrative '' in a `` Marquezian setting .

Parents , Families , and Friends of Lesbians and Gays ( PFLAG ) is a socio-political group of family members and friends of lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) people . Its mission statement describes the goals of PFLAG as promoting health and well being of LGBT persons as well as actively supporting their families and friends through education and positive advocacy . This work falls into three general areas : In 2002 PFLAG welcomed intersex persons and their families as fully participating members . PFLAG has more than 500 affiliates throughout the United States , the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico , and 11 other countries . The acronym PFLAG is pronounced `` P-FLAG '' , and until removal of the hyphen in 1993 was officially styled in that manner . The event that sparked PFLAG was in 1972 when Jeanne Manford was watching a TV news report and saw her son `` being tossed down an escalator during a protest while the New York City Police Department stood by and watched . '' The idea for the organization arose out of Jeanne Manford 's marching with her gay son Morty , carrying a sign saying : `` Parents of Gays : Unite in Support for Our Children '' in New York City 's Christopher Street Liberation Day Gay Pride Parade ( now known as Heritage of Pride ) which started two years prior . People came up to Manford during and after the parade , applauding her actions and inspiring her to form a support group for gays and lesbians and their families . In time the scope of the organization â `` which turned into POG ( Parents of Gays ) , later P-FLAG , and beginning in 1993 , PFLAG â `` expanded to include bisexuals , and ultimately , transgender people . PFLAG has grown to comprise 500 chapters and 250,000 members in the United States . `` Stay Close '' is a national campaign started in 2006 by PFLAG that encourages the family and friends of a LGBT persons to give them support . In the mid-1990s , `` Project Open Mind '' caused some controversy from Pat Robertson . He threatened to sue PFLAG and any television station that aired the project 's ads , which showed clips of anti-LGBT quotes from several people , including Robertson , Jerry Falwell , and United States Sen. Jesse Helms . The ads can currently be seen on the Commercial Closet webpage . The PFLAG Northeast Regional Conference for family , friends , and allies from across the region took place October 27 to October 29 , 2006 . The venue was the DCU Center in Worcester , Massachusetts USA . It was held in conjunction with the Transcending Boundaries Conference . The 2007 PFLAG National Convention , sponsored by IBM , was planned for October 11 through October 17 , 2007 in McLean , Virginia . The theme is `` Family Voices Moving Equality Forward . ''

Castrop-Rauxel is a former mining city in the eastern part of the Ruhr Area . Castrop-Rauxel is between Dortmund to the east , Bochum ( south ) , Herne ( west ) , and to the north , Recklinghausen , Datteln and Waltrop . First mentioned in 834 as `` Villa Castorpe '' , the city of Castrop was founded in 1902 by merging the municipalities Castrop , Obercastrop and Behringhausen . On April 1 , 1926 Castrop-Rauxel was formed when Castrop merged with 10 other municipalities . During World War II , a plant at Castrop-Rauxel used the Bergius process to produce synthetic oil products . In 1975 , the village of Henrichenburg was annexed and Castrop-Rauxel became part of the Recklinghausen ( district ) . In 1984 the last of 7 coal mines at Castrop = Rauxel ( `` Erin '' ) closed . Castrop-Rauxel has access to three major highways , the Emscherschnellweg A 42 , the Sauerlandlinie A 45 and the A 2 . There are 3 railway stations within the city . The central station ( Castrop-Rauxel Hauptbahnhof ) on the Cologne-Minden Railway is located in the suburb of Rauxel . Connecting Castrop-Rauxel to the western Ruhr cities like Duisburg , Oberhausen , Essen , Gelsenkirchen , Herne and in the east to Dortmund and Hamm . The unmanned stations of Castrop-Rauxel South ( Castrop-Rauxel Sued ) and Castrop-Rauxel Merklinde on the Emschertalbahn are offering hourly services with trains to Dortmund , Herne and Dorsten . Located in the city center is the central bus station Muensterplatz . From here passengers can travel to almost all suburbs and to neighboring cities like Herne , Dortmund and Bochum . The Rhine-Herne Canal runs right through Castrop-Rauxel ; Castrop-Rauxel also has a small Yacht club on this body of water . Castrop-Rauxel has been attempting to change from a former mining city to a city with a modern lifestyle , high recreational value , new economy companies , a 27 hole golf course , and various cultural events . The WLT ( Westphalian State Theater ) is the oldest and most relevant source of theatrical entertainment in Castrop-Rauxel . There is one cinema with two screens in Castrop . Castropâ s history is closely connected to horse racing , the Reiterbrunnen in the very center of Castropâ s market square is a reminder of the race days on the Naturhindernisbahn , now part of the Goldschmieding Park .
There is also the grave of local woman AgnÃ s Souret , the first woman chosen as ` the most beautiful woman in France ' . Espelette is known for its dried red peppers , used whole or ground to a hot powder , used in the production of Bayonne ham .
Strictly speaking , Darling Point and Darlinghurst were named in honor of Darling 's wife Henrietta . The Chicago Blues Festival is an annual event held in June that features three days of performances by top-tier blues musicians , both old favorites and the up-and-coming . It is hosted by the City of Chicago Mayor 's Office of Special Events , and always occurs in early June . The event has always taken place at Petrillo Music Shell in Grant Park , adjacent to the Lake Michigan waterfront east of the Loop in Chicago . Chicago has a storied history with blues that goes back generations stemming from the Great Migration from the South and particularly the Mississippi Delta region in pursuit of advancement and better career possibilities for musicians . Created by Commissioner of Cultural Affairs Lois Weisberg , the festival began in 1984 , a year after the death of McKinley Morganfield , better known as Muddy Waters , who is generally considered `` the father of Chicago blues '' . Each year the organizers choose a theme , generally to honor a recently departed blues musician . Obviously , Chicago blues acts are common . Also , in keeping with the blues ' influence on other musical genres , there are some soul , jazz blues and blues-rock acts . Since those early beginnings the festival has risen to a status that the City of Chicago bills as the world 's largest free concert of its kind . The Blues Festival is the largest of the city 's music festivals .

Wappingers Falls is a village in Dutchess County , New York , United States . The name is derived from the local Wappinger Indians . One half of the village is in the town of Wappinger and the other half is in the town of Poughkeepsie , with Wappinger Creek forming the dividing line between the towns . The Wappingers Falls Historic District includes downtown , several adjacent residential neighborhoods , and Mesier Park & Homestead . Mesier Park has been a public park since ca . 1891 , and hosts many annual events that focus around the band stand and tree lined paths of the park . The Village of Wappingers Falls also holds claim to New York State 's 6th oldest library , the Grinnell Library . The area was part of the Rombout Patent . The community was founded around 1200BC . The village of Wappingers Falls was incorporated in 1871 and included the adjacent community of Channingville . The local waterfall was important for early industrial development and included 13 factories in the early 1900s . Wappingers Falls is located at ( 41.599093 , -73.918077 ) .

Wappinger Creek flows through the village . As mentioned above , a portion of the village of Wappingers Falls is located within the town of Wappinger . However the large post office which services both municipalities is located in the village of Wappingers Falls . Thus both the village of Wappingers Falls and the town of Wappinger ( as well as portions of Fishkill , East Fishkill , Poughkeepsie and Lagrange ) all have the same ZIP code : `` WAPPINGERS FALLS , NY 12590 '' . This often results in confusion . The town of Wappinger is 28 s. Truckers and travelers often attempt to locate an address in the 1.2 s village of Wappingers Falls when the location they are actually seeking is somewhere in the much larger town of Wappinger ( or portions of Fishkill , East Fishkill , Poughkeepsie and Lagrange ) . US 9 passes through the village , as well as NY 9D . As of the census of 2000 , there were 4,929 people , 1,980 households , and 1,191 families residing in the village .

Franz Welser-M Ã st ( born 16 August 1960 ) is an Austrian conductor who is currently the music director for the Cleveland Orchestra and the Vienna State Opera . Franz Leopold Maria MÃ st was born in Linz , Austria , and later studied under the composer Balduin Sulzer . As a youth in Linz , he studied the violin and had developed an interest in conducting . After suffering injuries in a car crash that led to nerve damage , he stopped his violin studies and shifted full-time to conducting studies . In 1985 , MÃ st assumed the stage name Welser-M Ã st on suggestion of his mentor , Baron Andreas von Bennigsen of Liechtenstein , thus paying homage to the city of Wels where he grew up . In 1986 , he was adopted by von Bennigsen . In 1992 , Welser-M Ã st married von Bennigsen 's former wife , Angelika . His first major debuts were at the Salzburg Festival in 1985 , followed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1986 and the Orchester Musikkollegium Winterthur in 1988 . Other guest conductor appearances comprised the first five years of his career : his American debut with the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra in 1989 , performances with the orchestras of Atlanta , Boston , New York , Chicago , plus frequent returns to the London Philharmonic . In 1990 , Welser-M Ã st became principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra ( LPO ) . His LPO tenure was controversial , with London critics giving him the nickname `` Frankly Worse than Most '' . He concluded his LPO tenure in 1996 . From 1995 to 2000 , he was music director with the Zurich Opera House . While there , he led 27 new performances as well as numerous revivals . His most noteworthy performances there included the complete Ring Cycle . He became general music director of the Zurich Opera in September 2005 , with an original commitment to the Opera through 2011 . But Welser-M Ã st stood down from the Zurich post in July 2008 after having agreed to serve in the same capacity at Vienna 's Staatsoper . Welser-M Ã st became music director of The Cleveland Orchestra with the 2002\/2003 season , for an initial contract of 5 years . At the end of his first season , his contract was extended for another 5 years . In June 2008 , the orchestra announced a further extension of his contract with The Cleveland Orchestra through the 2017\/2018 season . On June 6 , 2007 , the Austrian government announced the appointment of Welser-M Ã st as Musical Director ( Generalmusikdirektor ) of the Vienna State Opera beginning in September 2010 , alongside Dominique Meyer as director ( Staatsoperndirektor ) . Welser-M Ã st is an honorary member of the Wiener Singverein . He conducted the Vienna New Year 's Concert in 2010\/2011 . Welser-M Ã st had debuted at the Staatsoper in 1987 , taking over from Claudio Abbado Gioachino Rossini 's L'italiana in Algeri . It took more than 10 years for Welser-M Ã st to return to the State Opera where he conducted Richard Wagner 's Tristan und Isolde . In December 2006 he led his first new production in Vienna , Richard Strauss ' Arabella ( directed by Sven-Eric Bechtolf ) , and later new stagings of Wagner 's Der Ring des Nibelungen ( directed by Bechtolf ) and TannhÃ user ( directed by Claus Guth ) . Welser-M Ã st began his Viennese tenure by conducting revivals of TannhÃ user and the Franco Zeffirelli directed La bohÃ me . In October 2010 , he led a new production of Cardillac , followed by new productions of Don Giovanni ( staged by Jean-Louis Martinoty ) , Le nozze di Figaro ( directed by Martinoty ) , and finally KÃ Å a KabanovÃ ( directed by AndrÃ Engel ) , later in the season 2010\/2011 . Additionally , he is set to conduct other productions in that season . From the start of his career Welser-M Ã st has heavily emphasized the importance of recording his work . While conducting the LPO he established an exclusive recording contract with EMI . This move produced several great successes and awards . His 1996 recording of Franz Schmidt 's Symphony No. 4 received the Gramophone Award for Best Orchestral Conducting . The CDs of Anton Bruckner 's Mass No. 3 Te Deum and works of Erich Wolfgang Korngold both received Grammy Award nominations for `` Best Classical Album . '' EMI struck a similar deal with Welser-M Ã st to record performances at the Zurich Opera and has released a number of DVD 's of his Zurich opera productions . In 2008 EMI reissued many of Welser-M Ã st 's earlier recordings in an eight CD set . In October of 2007 , Deutsche Grammophon released the first commercial recording featuring Welser-M Ã st with The Cleveland Orchestra : Beethoven 's Symphony No. 9 including German bass RenÃ Pape among the soloists . This recording will soon be followed by a disc of Richard Wagner 's Lieder performed by the Orchestra and soloist Measha Brueggergosman .
A Soxhlet extractor is a piece of laboratory apparatus invented in 1879 by Franz von Soxhlet . It was originally designed for the extraction of a lipid from a solid material . However , a Soxhlet extractor is not limited to the extraction of lipids . Typically , a Soxhlet extraction is only required where the desired compound has a limited solubility in a solvent , and the impurity is insoluble in that solvent . If the desired compound has a significant solubility in a solvent then a simple filtration can be used to separate the compound from the insoluble substance . Normally a solid material containing some of the desired compound is placed inside a thimble made from thick filter paper , which is loaded into the main chamber of the Soxhlet extractor . The Soxhlet extractor is placed onto a flask containing the extraction solvent . The Soxhlet is then equipped with a condenser . The solvent is heated to reflux . The solvent vapor travels up a distillation arm , and floods into the chamber housing the thimble of solid . The condenser ensures that any solvent vapor cools , and drips back down into the chamber housing the solid material . The chamber containing the solid material slowly fills with warm solvent . Some of the desired compound will then dissolve in the warm solvent . When the Soxhlet chamber is almost full , the chamber is automatically emptied by a siphon side arm , with the solvent running back down to the distillation flask . This cycle may be allowed to repeat many times , over hours or days . During each cycle , a portion of the non-volatile compound dissolves in the solvent . After many cycles the desired compound is concentrated in the distillation flask . The advantage of this system is that instead of many portions of warm solvent being passed through the sample , just one batch of solvent is recycled . After extraction the solvent is removed , typically by means of a rotary evaporator , yielding the extracted compound . The non-soluble portion of the extracted solid remains in the thimble , and is usually discarded . Very similar to the Soxhlet extractor , the Kumagawa extractor has a specific design where the thimble holder\/chamber is directly suspended inside the solvent flask ( having a vertical large opening ) above the boiling solvent . The thimble is surrounded by hot solvent vapor and maintained at a higher temperature compared to the Soxhlet extractor , thus allowing better extraction for compounds with higher melting points such as bitumen . The removable holder\/chamber is fitted with a small siphon side arm and , in the same way as for Soxhlet , a vertical condenser ensures that the solvent drips back down into the chamber which is automatically emptied at every cycle . William B. Jensen notes that the earliest example of a continuous extractor is archaeological evidence for a Mesopotamian hot-water extractor for organic matter dating from approximately 3500 BC . Before Soxhlet , the French chemist Anselme Payen also pioneered with continuous extraction in the 1830s .
Omnivores ( from Latin : omni all , everything ; vorare to devour ) are species that eat both plants and animals as their primary food source . They are opportunistic , general feeders not specifically adapted to eat and digest either meat or plant material primarily . Omnivory has evolved several times among different groups of animals . The first vertebrates were piscivores , then insectivores , carnivores and finally herbivores . A complex set of adaptations was necessary for feeding on highly fibrous plant materials , requiring structural modifications to the teeth , jaws , and digestive tract . Only a small proportion of extant tetrapods are obligate herbivores ; many carnivores also consume low-fiber plant material as well as insects and fish , so it could be that early tetrapods made the transition to fully fledged herbivory by way of omnivory . Although the term omnivore literally means eater of everything , omnivores can not really eat `` everything '' that other animals eat ; they can only eat things that are at least moderately easy to get and still at least moderately nutritious . For example , most of them can not live by grazing ( easy to get , but not nutritious enough ) , nor can they eat some hard-shelled animals or successfully hunt large or fast prey ( nutritious , but too hard to get ) . Although there are cases of herbivores eating meat matter , as well as examples of carnivores eating plants , the classification refers to the adaptations and main food source of the species in general , so these exceptions do not make either individual animals nor the species as a whole omnivores . Pigs furnish a well-known example of an omnivore . Crows are another example of an omnivore that many people see every day . Humans are regarded as omnivores . Most bear species are considered omnivores , but individual diets can range from almost exclusively herbivorous to almost exclusively carnivorous , depending on what food sources are available locally and seasonally . Polar bears are classified as carnivores while pandas are classified as herbivores , although giant pandas will eat some meat ( e.g. , insects ) from time to time , and polar bears will sometimes eat plants ( such as kelp ) but of neither is the exception a significant part of their diet . Various mammals are omnivorous by nature , such as pigs , badgers , bears , coatis , hedgehogs , opossums , skunks , sloths , squirrels , raccoons , chipmunks , mice and rats . Also some primates are omnivorous including humans and chimpanzees . Various birds are omnivorous , whose diet varies from berries and nectar to insects , worms , fish , and small rodents ; examples include cassowarys , chickens , crows and related corvids , keas , rallidae , and rheas . In addition , some lizards , turtles , fish , such as piranhas , and invertebrates are also omnivorous . While virtually all mammals may display `` omnivorous '' behavior patterns - depending on conditions of supply , culture , etc - mammals will generally prefer one class of food or another , with optimized digestive processes . Like most arboreal species , most squirrels are primarily granivores , preferring nuts and seeds . but as with virtually all mammals , squirrels can resort to consuming some meat as fallback food if starving or facultatively , e.g. , when nests are in danger of being raided by predators , etc. Depending on the species of bear , there is generally a preference for one class of food or another as plants and animals are digested differently . While scientific classification aims to promote communication and analysis of various differences and similarities between species , the concept of an `` omnivore '' is broad and could be applied to virtually any mammal since disease risks and the quality of digestion are often not considered . There are social , psychological and non-nutritive factors that influence diet behavior . '' ( T ) he behavioral basis of omnivory has not been thoroughly explored ... and food selection behavior is central to understanding the causes and consequences of omnivory . However , few studies have actually addressed this issue through rigorous tests of multiple hypotheses . '' In order for the concept of `` omnivore '' to be regarded as a scientific classification , some clear set of measurable and relevant criteria would need to be considered to differentiate between an `` omnivore '' and the other vague but less ambiguous diet categories e.g. , faunivore , folivore , scavenger , etc.
The Voyager series is a group of express diesel electric multiple unit trains built by Bombardier Transportation for service on the UK railway network . The Class 220 Voyager was built to operate Cross Country intercity services . 34 four-car sets were built between 2000 - 2001 and operated by Virgin Trains . With Virgin 's loss of the Cross Country franchise , these were all transferred to the new operator CrossCountry in November 2007 . The Class 221 Super Voyager was built as a tilting version of the Class 220 . Although visually similar , the majority of these trains have five cars instead of four , and have been fitted with a tilting mechanism similar to that on the Class 390 EMU . 44 sets were constructed for use by Virgin Trains ; of these , 23 have been transferred to CrossCountry with the remaining 21 being retained by Virgin , which will be used on parts of their West Coast franchise . None of the CrossCountry class 221s now use the tilting mechanism since the services were withdrawn from the West Coast Main Line and their tilting mechanisms have been de-activated and locked out of use as a result . The Class 222 `` Meridian '' DEMUs are broadly similar to the original Voyager units , but feature a number of reliability improvements and different internal layout . The Class 222 was constructed using lessons learned from the 220 and 221 units in regard to the interior , specifically in regard to installing many more components under the floor of the carriages , thereby increasing space for the passengers . A total of 27 sets were constructed initially : In 2010 Bombardier proposed the conversion of several Voyager multiple units into hybrid diesel and electric vehicles capable of taking power from an overhead pantograph ( electro-diesels EDMUs ) . Additional pantograph vehicles would be manufactured at Bombardier Transportation 's Derby plant , and 21 trainsets converted , at a cost of approximately Â # 300million . The proposal was named Project Thor .

Brent Sopel ( born January 7 , 1977 ) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman currently playing for the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . On April 3 , 1996 , just under a year after being drafted , Sopel signed his first professional contract with his draft team , the Vancouver Canucks . Sopel scored his first NHL goal on April 10 , 1999 against the Edmonton Oilers ' Tommy Salo . Sopel was traded back to the Canucks during their 2006 â `` 07 season , on February 1 , 2007 , the NHL trade deadline . He missed the first game of the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs against the Dallas Stars after he injured his back picking a cracker up off the floor . The Canucks beat the Stars in quadruple overtime , in the sixth longest game in NHL history . On August 3 , 2005 , the Canucks traded Sopel to the New York Islanders for a conditional draft pick in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft . On August 16 , just under a week after being traded , Sopel signed a two-year , $ 4.8-million dollar with the Islanders . Heading into the 2007 â `` 08 season with no contract , Sopel was invited to the Detroit Red Wings ' training camp . However , on September 28 , 2007 , Sopel left Red Wings camp , signing a one-year , $ 1.5-million contract with the Chicago Blackhawks after the Red Wings had only offered a one-year , $ 500,000 contract . On January 10 , 2008 , Sopel signed a 3-year , $ 7-million contract extension with the Blackhawks , keeping him in Chicago through to the 2010-11 NHL season . On June 9 , 2010 , Brent Sopel won the Stanley Cup with the Chicago Blackhawks . In June 2010 , Sopel brought the team 's recently won Stanley Cup to the 2010 Chicago Gay Pride Parade . Sopel brought the Cup to the parade in honor of the late Brendan Burke , son of his former boss in Vancouver , Brian , to display it in the Chicago Gay Pride Parade , stating to the press that honoring Burke 's legacy and his father 's example of familial support and tolerance was one of his reasons for marching in the parade . Although he was the team 's representative , contrary to popular belief , Sopel did not use his personal day with it in the parade . On June 23 , 2010 , Sopel was traded to the Atlanta Thrashers along with Dustin Byfuglien , Ben Eager , and Akim Aliu , for the 24th ( Kevin Hayes ) and 54th overall picks ( Justin Holl ) in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft , Marty Reasoner , Joey Crabb and Jeremy Morin . After playing 59 games for Atlanta , registering 2 goals and 7 points , he was traded to the Montreal Canadiens along with Nigel Dawes for Ben Maxwell and a 4th-round draft pick in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft on February 24 , 2011 . Although born in Calgary , Sopel grew up in Saskatoon , Saskatchewan in the city 's Silverwood Heights neighborhood , where he attended Sister O'Brien School and Marion M. Graham Collegiate . Brent is married to Kelly since 2001 . They have 2 sons ; Paul & Jacob and 2 daughters ; Lyla & Jayla . Lyla has been diagnosed with dyslexia and dysgraphia , like Brent . Paul was adopted in 2007 , when he was 17 years old . His parents , who were family friends of the Sopels , both died in a short period of time . Brent and Kelly thought it would be best if they took care of him .

Not to be confused with the River Braid , Ballymena , Northern Ireland . For other uses see Braid ( disambiguation ) . A braided river is one of a number of channel types and has a channel that consists of a network of small channels separated by small and often temporary islands called braid bars or , in British usage , aits or eyots . Braided streams occur in rivers with high slope and\/or large sediment load ( Schumm and Kahn 1972 ) . Braided channels are also typical of environments that dramatically decrease channel depth , and consequently channel velocity , such as river deltas , alluvial fans and peneplains . Braided rivers , as distinct from meandering rivers , occur when a threshold level of sediment load or slope is reached . Geologically speaking an increase in sediment load will over time increase the slope of the river , so these two conditions can be considered synonymous and consequently a variation of slope can model a variation in sediment load . A threshold slope was experimentally determined to be 0.016 ( ft\/ft ) for a 0.15 c stream with poorly sorted coarse sand ( Schumm and Kahn 1972 ) . Any slope over this threshold created a braided stream , and under the threshold created a meandering stream or for very low slopes a straight channel . So the main controlling factor on river development is the amount of sediment that the river carries , once a given system crosses a threshold value for sediment load it will convert from a meandering system to a braided system . Also important to channel development is the proportion of suspended load sediment to bed load . An increase in suspended sediment allowed for the deposition of fine erosion resistant material on the inside of a curve which accentuated the curve and in some instances caused a river to shift from a braided to a meandering profile ( Schumm and Kahn 1972 ) . The channels and braid bars are usually highly mobile , with the river layout often changing significantly during flood events ( Hickin and Sichingabula 1988 ) . Channels move sideways via differential velocity : On the outside of a curve , deeper , swift water picks up sediment ( usually gravel or larger stones ) , which is re-deposited in slow-moving water on the inside of a bend . The braided channels may flow within an area defined by relatively stable banks or may occupy an entire valley floor . The Rakaia River in Canterbury , New Zealand has cut a channel 100 metres deep into the surrounding plains . All these regions contain young , rapidly eroding mountains . Europe contains two braided rivers : the Narew , in Poland and Belarus , and the Tagliamento in Northeastern Italy . A notable example of a large braided stream in the contiguous United States is the Platte River in central and western Nebraska . The sediment of the arid Great Plains is augmented by the presence of the nearby Sandhills region north of the river . The upper third of the lower Yellow River takes a braided form . The Sewanee Conglomerate , a Pennsylvanian coarse sandstone covering the Cumberland Plateau near the University of the South , is thought to have been an ancient braided river that once covered the eastern United States .

The Class 901 designation is used for two former British Rail Class 101 diesel multiple units converted for departmental use . They were reclassified from the Class 960 series in early 2004 by their owner Network Rail . The two units are described below . This unit was converted in 1986 from a Class 101 power-twin unit . It was rebuilt as an Ultrasonic Test Train , replacing the former-Derby Lightweight unit that was previously used for this task . The unit was substantially rebuilt , including new headlight clusters , sealing of many windows , and later fitting of video and floodlight equipment for night-time use . The unit also incorporates a heavily-modified former Class 432 4Rep driving motor vehicle , which is now an intermediate trailer . The Units Class 101 Power Cars are unique , as they are the only first generation DMU cars to have been converted to Air Brakes ( both Westinghouse and Electro-Pnumatic ) . Most of the brake equipment came from former Class 50 Diesel Electric Locomotives , with some parts from ex-Southern Region EMU stock . All first generation DMU 's were fitted with Vacuum Brakes from new . The Power Cars DB 977391\/392 are both now resident on the Churnet Valley Railway , for permeant way use . It is doubtful how much use the unit will get - as it is expensive to run . Both the units engines AND the units in-built generator unit need to be running - the generator provides a 240Vac supply for the battery charger and compressor ( the units original engine driven air pumps would not be able to cope with air demand for Air brakes , air ep gear changing valves and the Air Conditioning units - which also require air . In addition , special keys are required for the unit - which provide access to the doors , and only certain keys will fit the Drivers control switch . The unit was originally painted in a unique silver and gray livery . This was replaced by Serco red\/grey in the mid-1990s , followed by Railtrack Blue\/lime green and finally Network Rail 's all-over yellow . This unit was converted in 1991 , also from a power twin unit . It was rebuilt by the Research & Development Division ( R&DD ) of British Rail as a test train known as `` Lab 19 - Iris II '' , supplementing the original `` Test Coach Iris '' , which was a former-Derby Lightweight single-car unit . It was used initially for radio survey work particularly with the National Radio Network ( NRN ) and later for video survey work including extensive signal sighting on the WCML prior to the introduction of 125 miles\/h running . Like 901001 , this unit has carried various liveries , starting with BR Research 's silver and gray livery , similar to that carried by 901001 . This was followed by Serco red\/grey , Railtrack Blue\/lime green , and most recently the latest Network Rail all-over yellow livery . This unit was withdrawn and stored at Derby 's Railway Technical Centre and was sold by Network Rail to a private buyer in early 2008 . It is now resident at Dunster station on the West Somerset Railway , where it has been re-painted into BR green and will be used on Pway trains .

`` Say ( All I Need ) '' is a song by American pop rock band OneRepublic . It is the third single released from their debut album Dreaming Out Loud and follows the global success of their previous top ten singles , `` Apologize '' and `` Stop and Stare '' . OneRepublic vocalist Ryan Tedder has commented that `` Say ( All I Need '' ) is his `` favorite track on the album . '' All five members of the band Ryan Tedder , Zach Filkins , Drew Brown , Eddie Fisher and Brent Kutzle share writing and composing credits on the song . The single was released in the UK on June 2 , 2008 and features their Live Lounge cover of Duffy 's single `` Mercy '' . The single was released on June 24 , 2008 in the United States . The song was recorded at Rocket Carousel Studios in Culver City by producer Greg Wells and engineer Drew Pearson . The chorus of the song was featured during the most recent season of The Hills . Also it featured in the pilot episode of the TV series , Vampire Diaries . On July 3 , 2008 , OneRepublic made a guest appearance on So You Think You Can Dance ( Season 4 ) for a live performance of `` Say ( All I Need ) '' . In France , the song was recorded as a duet with the French R&B singer Sheryfa Luna and was renamed as Say ( Ã l'infini ) . The official music video for `` Say ( All I Need ) '' was filmed in Paris , France and directed by Anthony Mandler . Filmed partially in black and white the video begins with the sound of church bells waking up Ryan Tedder . He dons a jacket and grabs a small black journal and leaves the house . As he leaves the house he passes by Chris Cornell , who makes a cameo appearance . The music begins and we see Tedder walking and sometimes running throughout the city near such famous Paris landmarks as the Sacre Coeur , seemingly in search of something , while other members of the band are seen in different locations throughout the city . Drew Brown is seen riding a Vespa scooter and Zach Filkins , Eddie Fisher , and Brent Kutzle have individual close-ups on a bridge and walking down some graffiti covered alleys . The band is also seen performing the song in an ex-meat abattoir in Paris , now artists apartments . As the music swells and begins to climax Tedder races through the city , enters a building and climbs a winding staircase to the top . Reaching the top , he steps out onto a rooftop with a breathtaking view of the city at sunset . He then takes the small black journal from his pocket and writes , `` just say , '' ending the music video . Tedder has given this explanation for the meaning of the song , `` This song is about being happy with what you have in life , and not obsessing over what you do n't have . Whether it 's a person or relationship , love , or success , or even fame . '' `` We wanted to make a piece of art and do something beautiful and inspiring , '' said Tedder . Months before the single 's official release , `` Say ( All I Need ) '' had already started appearing on the charts relying on downloads alone . Its first appearance was in November , ( shortly after Dreaming Out Loud was released ) on Billboards Hot Digital Songs , debuting at number seventy-five . It dropped out a few weeks after . The song reappeared on Billboard 's Hot Digital Songs after its official release in the United Kingdom and peaked at number fifty-one . The song made its way up the UK charts and a few other European charts , after its official release . The song was released to radio in the US in the third week of June 2008
For the medical commentator and comedian , see Phil Hammond ( comedian ) . The Right Honourable Philip Hammond Hon BA ( Oxon . ) MP ( born 4 December 1955 ) is a British Conservative Party politician . He is the Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Runnymede and Weybridge . He was appointed Secretary of State for Transport on 12 May 2010 , and appointed as a Privy Counsellor on 13 May 2010 . Philip Hammond was born in Epping , Essex , the son of a civil engineer , and educated at Shenfield School ( now Shenfield High School ) in Brentwood , Essex , and University College , Oxford , where he was awarded a degree in Philosophy , Politics , and Economics . He joined the medical equipment manufacturers Speywood Laboratories Ltd in 1977 , becoming a director of Speywood Medical Limited in 1981 . In 1982 , an automatic electrocardiograph electrode manufacturing plant figured among his notable achievements . He left in 1983 . From 1984 , he was a director in Castlemead Ltd , and from 1993 â `` 35 he was a partner in CMA Consultants , and from 1994 , a director in Castlemead Homes . He has had many business interests including house building and property , manufacturing , healthcare and oil and gas . He has undertaken various consulting assignments in Latin America for the World Bank in Washington , D.C. , and was a consultant to the government of Malawi from 1995 until his election to Parliament . He was the chairman of the Lewisham East Conservative Association for seven years from 1989 and contested the 1994 Newham North East by-election caused by the death of the sitting Labor Ron Leighton , losing to Labour 's Stephen Timms by 11,818 votes . He was elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 General Election for the new Surrey seat of Runnymede and Weybridge . He won the seat with a majority of 9,875 and has remained the MP there since . He made his maiden speech on 17 June 1997 , reminding the House that it was in his constituency at Runnymede in 1215 , when King John sealed Magna Carta , that the basis of constitutional government in England began to emerge . Philip Hammond was criticised in 2009 when it emerged that he claimed just Â # 8 short of the maximum allowance for a second home in London from 2007 to 2008 even though he lived in the commuter belt town of Woking . The Sun columnist Kelvin Mackenzie stated that as Mr Hammond had previously refused to support his opposition to a rise in car parking charges at Weybridge railway station , the revelation about the second home showed that Hammond is `` not interested in the downtrodden local motorist '' . As a result of the criticism Mr Hammond told his local paper that he would pay back any profit he makes on the future sale of his second home to the public purse . When his expenses were revealed on the internet it emerged that Hammond had spent Â # 1,270 of taxpayers ' money per year on newspapers , and once spent Â # 24 of public money on eight teaspoons . In October 2010 , on BBC TV 's Question Time , he was asked if he had avoided paying tax and moved his shares into his wife 's name . He explained that he had transferred shares to his wife because government ministers are not allowed to hold shares ; this was nothing to do with tax . He denied any tax avoidance or wrongdoing . Following the same TV debate , Hammond was accused of `` callous flippancy '' in having commented that people committed suicide on the railway tracks at Wimbledon with `` monotonous regularity '' , causing inconvenience by affecting the reliability of the service . This led Dr Peter Byrne of the Royal College of Psychiatrists , to reflect , `` There was very little mention of mental health in the Government spending review and it is a pity to hear these kinds of views come through in such ill-considered remarks . '' . In parliament he served on the environment , transport and the regions select committee from 1997 until he was promoted to the front bench by William Hague in 1998 as a spokesman on health . He was moved to become a spokesman on trade and industry by Iain Duncan Smith in 2001 , moving to speak on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister 's responsibilities by Michael Howard in 2003 . Mr Howard promoted Hammond to the shadow cabinet following the 2005 general election as the Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury . Following the election of David Cameron later in 2005 , he became the Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions . He was moved back to the role of Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury in David Cameron 's reshuffle following Gordon Brown 's accession to the premiership . He married Susan Carolyn Williams-Walker on 29 June 1991 and they have two daughters and a son . They live in Send , Surrey , and have another home in London . Hammond 's wealth is estimated at Â # 7.5 m or Â # 9m .
Mary Elizabeth Gore ( nÃ e Aitcheson ; born August 19 , 1948 ) , commonly known as Tipper Gore , is an author , photographer , former Second Lady of the United States , and the estranged wife of Al Gore . She is also well known for her active role in the Parents Music Resource Center and voicing strong opinions for the labeling of record covers of releases featuring profane language , especially in the heavy metal and rap genres . Born Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson in Washington , D.C. , Tipper Gore is the daughter of John `` Jack '' Kenneth Aitcheson Jr. , a plumbing-supply entrepreneur , and his first wife , Margaret Ann Carlson Odom ( who lost her first husband during World War II ) . Gore has English ancestry and grew up in Arlington , Virginia . Her parents divorced and she was raised by her mother and grandmother . Her nickname , Tipper , derives from the lullaby `` Tippy , Tippy , Tin '' , originally sung in the 1940 Our Gang short `` All About Hash '' by child actress Janet Burston . She attended St. Agnes ( now St. Stephen 's & St. Agnes School ) , a private Episcopal school in Alexandria , Virginia , where she excelled in athletics and played the drums for an all-girl band , The Wildcats . She met Gore at his senior prom in 1965 . Although she came to the prom with one of his classmates , Gore and Tipper began to date immediately afterwards . When Gore began attending Harvard University , she enrolled in Garland Junior College ( now part of Simmons College ) and later transferred to Boston University , receiving her B.A. in psychology in 1970 . Gore pursued a master 's degree in psychology from George Peabody College , graduating in 1975 . She then worked part-time as a newspaper photographer until her husband was elected to the U.S. Congress in 1976 . On May 19 , 1970 , she and Gore were married at the Washington National Cathedral . She has four children : Karenna Aitcheson Gore Schiff ( born on August 6 , 1973 ) , Kristin Carlson Gore ( born on June 5 , 1977 ) , Sarah LaFon Gore ( born on January 7 , 1979 ) , and Albert Gore III ( born on October 19 , 1982 ) . A longtime family friend of Al and Tipper Gore confirmed on June 1 , 2010 that the Gores sent out an email to family friends announcing that they have made a mutual decision to separate . In 1985 , she co-founded the Parents Music Resource Center ( PMRC ) with Susan Baker , wife of then United States Secretary of the Treasury James Baker , because Tipper heard her then 11-year-old daughter playing `` Darling Nikki '' by Prince . According to an article by NPR , Gore went `` before Congress to urge warning labels for records marketed to children . '' A number of individuals including Dee Snider of Twisted Sister , Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys , John Denver , Joey Ramone and Frank Zappa criticized the group , arguing that it was a form of censorship . In response , NPR further stated that according to Gore , she `` was n't out to censor the objectionable material '' and quoted her as stating that she is `` a strong believer in the First Amendment '' who is calling for greater `` consumer information in the marketplace . '' Gore resigned from the group in 1992 when she became Second Lady . She was actively involved in her husband 's presidential campaign in 2000 , making numerous campaign stops nationwide such as at Chicago 's Taste of Polonia over Labor Day Weekend where she appeared along with Hadassah Lieberman . In 2002 , Tipper was urged by her supporters to run for the vacant U.S. Senate seat her husband once held in Tennessee , which was being vacated by Fred Thompson . However , she declined . In 2003 , Gore spoke at the `` Erasing the Stigma Awards '' about her experience with depression after her son , Al Gore III , was hit by a car when he was a young child . That year , at a party held by Larry King in Washington , D.C. , Mrs. Gore engaged in a heated exchange with Professor Richard Vatz of Towson University who had published an article in the Wall Street Journal critical of Gore 's view of mental illness and the costs which universal mental health coverage would entail .
`` Nunarput utoqqarsuanngoravit '' ( You Our Ancient Land ; ) is the national anthem of Greenland , an autonomous province of Denmark . With lyrics by Henrik Lund and music composed by Jonathan Petersen , the anthem was officially adopted in 1916 .

The lotus position ( DevanÄ garÄ `` : à à à à à 3\/4 à à ; IAST : padmÄ sana ) is a cross-legged sitting posture originating in meditative practices of ancient India , in which the feet are placed on the opposing thighs . It is an established posture , commonly used for meditation , in the Hindu Yoga and Buddhist contemplative traditions . The position is said to resemble a lotus , to encourage breathing proper to associated meditative practice , and to foster physical stability . Famous depictions of the lotus position include Shiva , the meditating ascetic god of Hinduism , and Siddhartha Gautama , the founder of Buddhism . PadmÄ sana means `` Lotus throne '' and is also a term for actual thrones , often decorated with lotus foliage motifs , on which figures in art sit . In Balinese Hinduism , a prominent feature of temples is a special form of padmasana shrine , with empty thrones mounted on a column , for deities , especially Acintya . From a seated posture , one foot is placed on top of the opposite thigh with sole facing upward and heel close to the abdomen . The other foot is then placed on the opposite thigh in a symmetrical way . The knees are in contact with the ground . The torso is placed in balance and alignment such that the spinal column supports it with minimal muscular effort . The torso is centered above the hips . To relax the head and neck , the jaw is allowed to fall towards the neck and the back of the neck to lengthen . The shoulders move backwards and the ribcage lifts . The tongue rests on the roof of the mouth . The hands may rest on the knees in chin or jnana mudra . The arms are relaxed with the elbows slightly bent . The eyes may be closed , the body relaxed , with awareness of the overall posture . Adjustments are made until balance and alignment are experienced . Alignment that creates relaxation is indicative of a suitable posture for the asana . The posture should be natural and comfortable , without any sharp pains . In most cases , a cushion ( zafu ) or mat ( zabuton ) is necessary in order to achieve this balance . One sits on the forward edge of the cushion or mat in order to incline one 's pelvis forward , making it possible to center the spine and provide the necessary support . Only the most flexible people can achieve this asana without a support under their pelvis ( and The Dalai Lama has explicitly advised against doing so ) . Those without sufficient flexibility to place both knees on the ground when in full lotus position should not use it , as it strains the knees and lower back of such people . Other meditation asanas are indicated until sufficient flexibility has been developed to sit comfortably in the Lotus . Sciatica , sacral infections and weak or injured knees are contra-indications to attempting the posture . The Lotus position is adopted to allow the body to be held completely steady for long periods of time . As the body is steadied the mind becomes calm , the first step towards meditation . The posture applies pressure to the lower spine which may facilitate relaxation . The breath can slow down , muscular tension decrease and blood pressure subside . The coccygeal and sacral nerves are toned as the normally large blood flow to the legs is redirected to the abdominal region . Digestion may also be improved .
WrestleMania VI was the World Wrestling Federation 's ( WWF ) sixth WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view event and the first to be held outside of the U.S. .

Future WWE Superstar Edge was in attendance , as were Lance Storm and Christian .
Stefan Reuter ( born 16 October 1966 in DinkelsbÃ 1\/4 hl ) is a German football coach and former player . A right sided defender who started his career with TSV 1860 DinkelsbÃ 1\/4 hl . 1982 he played for 1 . FC Nuremberg , first in the 2 . Bundesliga and since 1985 in the German Bundesliga . In exactly 100 games he scored 10 goals . He was occasionally used as a right sided midfielder . 1988 he was transferred to Bayern Munich . For this team he played 95 games in the Bundesliga and scored four goals . In 1989 and 1990 he won the German Championship with Bayern Munich . A proposed move to Liverpool F.C following West Germany 's victorious World Cup campaign was turned down at the last minute with Reuter following many of his compatriots to Italy . From 1990 to 1991 he played for Juventus F.C. ( 28 games ) , but turned back soon to Germany and played for Borussia Dortmund . Until the ending of his career he played 307 games for Dortmund and scored 11 goals in the Bundesliga . He also played for the German National Team . All in all it were 69 games ( 2 goals ) for Nuremberg ( 9 ) , Bayern Munich ( 18 ) , Juventus Turin ( 18 ) and Borussia Dortmund ( 33 ) . Reuter was part of the 1990 World Championship team , as well as on winning teams that competed in the Euro 1996 , and the Champions League in 1997 . He played on five teams that won the German Championship , and in 1984 , a team that won the U-16 European Championship . In 1992 Reuter became the first player in the European Championship history to be substituted as a substitute , when during the match between Germany and Scotland , he replaced Karlheinz Riedle but then only seven minutes later he had to leave the field due to an injury , and was replaced by Michael Schulz . He was known for his speed on the field ( 100 m in 11.2 s ) , a quality that resulted in his nickname `` Turbo '' . Reuter served as team manager for TSV 1860 MÃ 1\/4 nchen from January 2006 to 2 February 2009 when he was removed from the job .
A vibration in a string is a wave . Usually a vibrating string produces a sound whose frequency in most cases is constant . Therefore , since frequency characterizes the pitch , the sound produced is a constant note . Vibrating strings are the basis of any string instrument like guitar , cello , or piano . Let be the length of a piece of string , its mass , and its linear mass. . If the horizontal component of tension in the string is a constant , , then the tension acting on each side of the string segment is given by If both angles are small , then the tensions on either side are equal and the net horizontal force is zero . From Newton 's second law for the vertical component , the mass of this piece times its acceleration , , will be equal to the net force on the piece : The tangents of the angles at the ends of the string piece are equal to the slopes at the ends . Using this fact and rearranging provides where is the speed of propagation of the wave in the string . ( See the article on the wave equation for more about this ) . However , this derivation is only valid for vibrations of small amplitude ; for those of large amplitude , is not a good approximation for the length of the string piece , the horizontal component of tension is not necessarily constant , and the horizontal tensions are not well approximated by . Once the speed of propagation is known , the frequency of the sound produced by the string can be calculated . The speed of propagation of a wave is equal to the wavelength divided by the period , or multiplied by the frequency : If the length of the string is , the fundamental harmonic is the one produced by the vibration whose nodes are the two ends of the string , so is half of the wavelength of the fundamental harmonic . Hence : where is the tension , is the linear density , and is the length of the vibrating part of the string . Therefore : One can see the waveforms on a vibrating string if the frequency is low enough and the vibrating string is held in front of a CRT screen such as one of a television or a computer ( not of an oscilloscope ) . This effect is called the stroboscopic effect , and the rate at which the string seems to vibrate is the difference between the frequency of the string and the refresh rate of the screen . The same can happen with a fluorescent lamp , at a rate which is the difference between the frequency of the string and the frequency of the alternating current . ( If the refresh rate of the screen equals the frequency of the string or an integer multiple thereof , the string will appear still but deformed . ) In daylight , this effect does not occur and the string will appear to be still , but thicker and lighter , due to persistence of vision . A similar but more controllable effect can be obtained using a stroboscope . This device allows the frequency of the xenon flash lamp to be exactly matched to the frequency of vibration of the string ; in a darkened room , this clearly shows the waveform . Otherwise , one can use bending or , perhaps more easily , by adjusting the machine heads , to obtain the same frequency , or a multiple of , the AC frequency to achieve the same effect . For example , in the case of a guitar , the bass string pressed to the third fret gives a G at 97.999 Hz ; with a slight adjustment , a frequency of 100 Hz can be obtained , exactly one octave above the alternating current frequency in Europe and most countries in Africa and Asia . In most countries of the Americas , where the AC frequency is 60 Hz , one can start from A # at 116.54 Hz , on the fifth string at the first fret , to obtain a frequency of 120 Hz .

PBS Kids is the brand for children 's programming aired by the Public Broadcasting Service in the United States founded in 1993 . As with all PBS programming , PBS Kids programming is non-commercial . It is targeted to people ages 8 and under . Along with the block of programming on PBS , PBS Kids was a separate television network , founded in the fall of 1999 , and was targeted to young children aged 4-8 years . The PBS Kids Channel ran for six years and was largely funded by DirecTV . The channel ceased broadcast on September 26 , 2005 , in favor of a new commercial joint venture , PBS Kids Sprout , which is a partnership owned by Comcast About half of PBS TV stations still program a children 's channel themselves over their multicasting service , such as WNET , WHYY , WNED , UNC-TV , Georgia Public Broadcasting , Twin Cities Public Television , WGBH , WQED , WMHT WTTW , WYCC , and WETA-TV . On PBS , two blocks of programming are currently included in PBS Kids , including PBS Kids GO ! and the PBS Kids Preschool Block , and the former block , PBS Kids Bookworm Bunch , which was launched in 2000 and canceled in 2004 .
Sheila Chesed de Almeida Mello ( born July 23 , 1978 ) is a Brazilian dancer , actress and model . She became famous for dancing in the band Ã o Tchan ! Was born in Cidade Ademar , a district on the outskirts of SÃ # o Paulo . Before becoming known for her participation in the group Ã o Tchan ! , Sheila graduated in both classical ballet and in modern ballet . Her entry to the group Ã o Tchan ! came in 1998 through a contest held to choose a replacement for the dancer Carla Perez who left the group . Immediately after her victory she posed nude for the first time in Playboy magazine . She was on the cover in the other two editions , one next to Scheila Carvalho , her colleague Ã o Tchan ! . In October 2007 , she posed naked again , this time for the magazine Sexy . In 2009 , she participated of the second season of the Brazilian reality show , A Fazenda . During the competition , she came to know her future husband , the former swimmer Fernando Scherer . They married on July 24 , 2010 .
These independently became a reality thanks to Robert Goddard . Goddard also used a De Laval nozzle for the first time on a rocket , doubling the thrust and multiplying up the efficiency by several times . During the late 1930s , German scientists , such as Wernher von Braun and Hellmuth Walter , investigated installing liquid-fuelled rockets in military aircraft ( Heinkel He 112 , He 111 , He 176 and Messerschmitt Me 163 ) . The turbopump was first employed by German scientists in WWII . Until then cooling the nozzle was problematic , and the A4 ballistic missile used dilute alcohol for the fuel , which reduced the combustion temperature sufficiently . Staged combustion ( Ð -- Ð Ð 1\/4 Ð Ð 1\/2 Ñ Ñ Ð Ñ Ñ Ñ Ð Ð 1\/4 Ð ) was first proposed by Alexey Isaev in 1949 . The first staged combustion engine was the S1 .5400 used in the Soviet planetary rocket , designed by Melnikov , a former assistant to Isaev . About the same time ( 1959 ) , Nikolai Kuznetsov began work on the closed cycle engine NK-9 for Korolev 's orbital ICBM , GR-1 . Kuznetsov later evolved that design into the NK-15 and NK-33 engines for the unsuccessful Lunar N1 rocket . In the West , the first laboratory staged-combustion test engine was built in Germany in 1963 , by Ludwig Boelkow . Hydrogen peroxide \/ kerosene fuelled engines such as the British Gamma of the 1950s used a closed-cycle process ( arguably not staged combustion , but that 's mostly a question of semantics ) by catalytically decomposing the peroxide to drive turbines before combustion with the kerosene in the combustion chamber proper . This gave the efficiency advantages of staged combustion , whilst avoiding the major engineering problems . Liquid hydrogen engines were first successfully developed in America , the RL-10 engine first flew in 1962 . Hydrogen engines were used as part of the Project Apollo ; the liquid hydrogen fuel giving a rather lower stage mass and thus reducing the overall size and cost of the vehicle . The Space Shuttle 's SSME is the highest ground-launched specific impulse rocket engine to fly . A nozzle is a device designed to control the direction or characteristics of a fluid flow ( especially to increase velocity ) as it exits ( or enters ) an enclosed chamber or pipe via an orifice . A nozzle is often a pipe or tube of varying cross sectional area , and it can be used to direct or modify the flow of a fluid ( liquid or gas ) . Nozzles are frequently used to control the rate of flow , speed , direction , mass , shape , and\/or the pressure of the stream that emerges from them . A gas jet , fluid jet , or hydro jet is a nozzle intended to eject gas or fluid in a coherent stream into a surrounding medium . Gas jets are commonly found in gas stoves , ovens , or barbecues . Gas jets were commonly used for light before the development of electric light . Other types of fluid jets are found in carburetors , where smooth calibrated orifices are used to regulate the flow of fuel into an engine , and in jacuzzis or spas . Another specialized jet is the laminar jet . This is a water jet that contains devices to smooth out the pressure and flow , and gives laminar flow , as its name suggests . This gives better results for fountains . Nozzles used for feeding hot blast into a blast furnace or forge are called tuyeres . Frequently the goal is to increase the kinetic energy of the flowing medium at the expense of its pressure and internal energy . Nozzles can be described as convergent ( narrowing down from a wide diameter to a smaller diameter in the direction of the flow ) or divergent ( expanding from a smaller diameter to a larger one ) . A de Laval nozzle has a convergent section followed by a divergent section and is often called a convergent-divergent nozzle ( `` con-di nozzle '' ) . Convergent nozzles accelerate subsonic fluids . If the nozzle pressure ratio is high enough the flow will reach sonic velocity at the narrowest point ( i.e. the nozzle throat ) . In this situation , the nozzle is said to be choked . Increasing the nozzle pressure ratio further will not increase the throat Mach number beyond unity . Downstream ( i.e. external to the nozzle ) the flow is free to expand to supersonic velocities . Note that the Mach 1 can be a very high speed for a hot gas ; since the speed of sound varies as the square root of absolute temperature . Thus the speed reached at a nozzle throat can be far higher than the speed of sound at sea level . This fact is used extensively in rocketry where hypersonic flows are required , and where propellant mixtures are deliberately chosen to further increase the sonic speed . Divergent nozzles slow fluids , if the flow is subsonic , but accelerate sonic or supersonic fluids . Convergent-divergent nozzles can therefore accelerate fluids that have choked in the convergent section to supersonic speeds . This CD process is more efficient than allowing a convergent nozzle to expand supersonically externally . The shape of the divergent section also ensures that the direction of the escaping gases is directly backwards , as any sideways component would not contribute to thrust . A jet exhaust produces a net thrust from the energy obtained from combusting fuel which is added to the inducted air .

The Cheeky Girls are a pop music duo consisting of twin sisters Gabriela and Monica Irimia , from Cluj-Napoca in Transylvania , Romania , but based in Britain . After appearing as auditionees in Popstars : The Rivals , they achieved success in the charts with four top ten hits between 2002 and 2004 . They are best known for their debut single , `` Cheeky Song ( Touch My Bum ) '' , which has sold over 1.2 million copies worldwide . Gabriela and Monica were born on 31 October 1982 to Doru and Margit Irimia . Gabriela is older by 10 minutes . Their early life in Romania consisted of studying gymnastics and ballet and touring with the Michelle Cook ( Oldham , UK ) Hungarian National Opera . Moving to the United Kingdom with their mother in 2002 , the girls shot to fame as the Cheeky Girls after auditions on the British TV shows , Channel 4 's Model Behaviour and more importantly Popstars : The Rivals . Following two appearances on the show with their audition which had judges Pete Waterman and Louis Walsh not knowing what to say ( Waterman was later quoted as saying they were the worst act ever ) , various record companies approached the Granada Press Office . The Press Office contacted Paul Holland at Granada Ventures who was able to secure them a deal with the Multiply label part of Telstar Records . `` Cheeky Song ( Touch My Bum ) '' was swiftly recorded and released in the first week in December . Entering the chart at number two , the single remained in the top five for five consecutive weeks â `` four of them at number two . In the week before Christmas this was one of three singles from the Popstars : The Rivals show to occupy the Top 3 ; One True Voice and Girls Aloud held the other two positions . This was quickly followed up with two more top three hits , `` Take Your Shoes Off '' and '' ( Hooray , Hooray ! ) It 's a Cheeky Holiday ! '' . Their style of music is primarily disco-pop , aimed at the pre-teen market . Most of their songs are written by their mother , who also acts as their manager . In January 2004 , their first single , `` The Cheeky Song ( Touch my Bum ) '' was voted the worst pop record of all time in a Channel 4 poll . When their record company Multiply went into liquidation in 2004 the girls turned down several deals from other companies and decided to launch their own label XBN , to continue their music career , but with lesser success . From 2004 , they began to appear regularly in other media such as television appearances on Brainiac and The Weakest Link and opening the studios of a new local radio station Big L 1395 , along with Cliff Richard . The Cheeky Girls are also involved in a lot of charity work and are very keen supporters of the UK Children 's Charity ChildLine . On 4 August 2006 London newspaper the Evening Standard reported that the Cheeky Girls were already `` at rock bottom '' and facing bankruptcy action in court owing to not having been paid by their now defunct record company Telstar Records . The article said that the girls owed Â # 4,500 in unpaid taxes , along with other bills due , and that Telstar owes them Â # 2.2 million . Later it was reported that they owed Â # 130,000 in total . In September 2009 the girls released their Cheeky Girls make-up range , aimed at the young teen market . In January 2010 Gabriela and Monica auditioned for Britain 's Got Talent under the name Cheeky Girls and Darius . They performed a Bollywood dance with a third partner , Darius , in the Hammersmith Apollo , London . The judges reacted favourably and they were voted through to continue in the competition . However , they did not make it to the Semi-Finals . In November 2010 , Gabriela and Monica appeared on the Celebrity edition of Channel 4 reality program Coach Trip 2 days before the series end . In 2007 it was revealed that they had had breast implants to go up to a 34C . In December 2005 it was revealed by the tabloids that former Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Ã -- pik had broken up with long time fiancÃ e , ITV1 weather presenter SiÃ cents n Lloyd , and was now romancing Gabriela . He was also involved in a case involving the girls ' deportation to Romania . As of 21 April they were engaged , though news of Gabriela breaking up with Lembit was reported in July 2008 . It was later reported that Gabriela had miscarried the then Montgomeryshire MP 's baby . On Friday 7 January 2011 Cheeky Girl Gabriela Irimia was arrested on suspicion of stealing groceries in Sainsbury 's Wilmslow . She was subsequently given a caution for theft . The report refers to a `` 26 year old '' but in January 2011 , Gabriela must be 28 ( born Oct 1982 ) .
' is a municipality and a town in the middle of the Netherlands . The town is enclosed by the Waal river and the Linge river on the south and the north side , and the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal on the east side . The city was founded in the 5th century AC . Tiel is the largest town in the Betuwe area , which is famous for being one of the centres of Dutch fruit production . Orchards in the area produce ( apples , pears , plums and cherries ) . Tiel once housed the famous jam factory De Betuwe . After production was moved to Breda in 1993 , the entire complex was demolished , although a part was reconstructed later . Reminding of this industry is a jam manufacturing museum and a statue of Flipje , the raspberry-based comic figure who starred in De Betuwe 's advertisements since the 1930s . Tiel is one of the oldest towns in the Netherlands . Originally located on the Linge river it became an important center of trade in the early Middle Ages , especially after the demise of Dorestad in the 9th century . Later in the Middle Ages Tiel was associated with the Hanseatic League . At the height of its glory Tiel had two big churches , one of which , the St. Walburg , was a collegiate church that belonged to the Teutonic Knights . Much of the historic center was destroyed during the Second World War . Every year on the second Saturday in September , a festival known as Fruitcorso is held , to celebrate the harvest of the fruit produced in the Betuwe area . It includes a parade of vehicles decorated with fruit . In the same weekend there 's Appelpop on the Waalkade , which is one of the biggest free pop festivals of the Netherlands . Tiel has also been known for its pewter industry . The last pewter factory cum museum , which mainly produced collectibles for tourists , went bankrupt in early 2004 , but has since been revived . Tiel can be a good starting point to explore the rest of the scenic Betuwe area , particularly in May when all the fruit trees in the surrounding areas are in bloom . The Dutch author and polemicist Menno ter Braak ( 1902 â `` 1940 ) grew up in Tiel .

The Russian Wikipedia is the Russian language edition of Wikipedia . It has over articles . It was founded on 20 May 2001 . By May 2008 it became the 10th largest Wikipedia by size and in February 2011 it ranked 8th . It is the largest Slavic Wikipedia , surpassing the Polish Wikipedia eightfold by the parameter of depth . Difficult issues are resolved through the Arbitration Committee , which handles content disputes , blocks users or prohibits certain users from editing articles on certain topics . Administrators are elected through a vote ; a minimal quorum of 30 voters and 66 % of support votes are required if the request is to be considered successful . Administrators who have become inactive ( i.e. have not used administrative tools , such as `` delete '' or `` block '' buttons , at least 25 times in six months ) may lose their privileges by an Arbitration Committee decision . The Russian Wikipedia was created on 20 May 2001 in the first wave of non-English Wikipedias , along with editions in Catalan , Chinese , Dutch , German , Esperanto , French , Hebrew , Italian , Japanese , Portuguese , Spanish , and Swedish . The first edit of the Russian Wikipedia was on 24 May 2001 , and consisted of the line '' Ð Ð 3\/4 Ñ Ñ Ð Ñ - Ð Ð Ð '' Ð Ð Ð Ñ Ñ Ñ Ñ Ð Ð 1\/2 Ð '' ( `` Russia is a great nation '' ) . The following edit changed it to the joke : '' Ð Ð 3\/4 Ñ Ñ Ð Ñ â '' Ñ Ð 3\/4 Ð Ð Ð 1\/2 Ð Ñ Ð '' Ð 3\/4 Ð 1\/2 Ð 3\/4 Ð ( Ñ Ñ Ð Ñ Ñ Ñ Ñ , Ð Ð 3\/4 Ð Ñ Ñ Ð Ð 1\/2 Ð 1\/2 Ð 3\/4 Ð Ð Ñ Ð 3\/4 Ñ Ð 3\/4 Ð Ð Ð 1\/4 Ð 3\/4 Ñ Ñ Ð â '' Ñ Ð 1\/4 . Ð 1\/4 Ð Ð 1\/4 Ð 3\/4 Ð 1\/2 Ñ ) '' ( `` Russia is the motherland of elephants ( big-eared , improved cross-country capability , see Mammoth ) '' . '' For a long time development was slow ( especially after some participants left for WikiZnanie ) , but in a year from February 2005 to February 2006 it surpassed nine editions in other languages - the Catalan , Bulgarian , Ukrainian , Hebrew , Finnish , Norwegian , Chinese , Esperanto and Danish Wikipedias . In 2006 , 2007 , 2009 and 2010 the Russian Wikipedia won the `` Science and education '' category of the `` Runet Prize '' award , supervised by the Russian government agency FAPMC . In 2010 , the distinctive Wikipedia globe logo for the Russian Wikipedia was temporarily altered to include the number 600,000 ( spread over two of the jigsaw pieces ) to commemorate the 600,000 article milestone . The Russian edition of PC Magazine has been in conflict with Russian Wikipedia since the middle 2009 . Several articles criticizing the `` bureaucratization '' , `` sysop tyranny '' and `` low quality '' of articles in RuWiki were published in the magazine . The conflict ended up in PC Magazine\/RE forbidding citation of its materials in the Russian Wikipedia and not allowing to access pages on Magazine\/RE 's site using a direct link from Wikipedia . 11,596 articles contain material from the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary .
Gary Lewis ( born Gary Harold Lee Levitch , July 31 , 1946 in Los Angeles , California ) is an American musician who was the eponymous leader of Gary Lewis & the Playboys . Gary Lewis is the son of comedian and actor Jerry Lewis . His mother , Patti Lewis ( nÃ e Esther Calonico ) , a singer at the time with the Ted Fio Rito Orchestra , reportedly intended to name him after her favorite actor , Cary Grant , but clerical error led to his naming as `` Gary '' . He received a set of drums as a gift for his fourteenth birthday in 1960 . When he was eighteen , Lewis formed what would become Gary Lewis & the Playboys ( then known as `` Gary And The Playboys '' ) with four other friends . Joking at the lateness of bandmates to practice , Lewis referred to them as `` playboys '' , and the name stuck . Lewis was the drummer , but at that time singing duties were held by guitarist Dave Walker . As the band started , Lewis 's mother was quietly funding the purchases of equipment , as they believed Garys ' father would not have supported the band . This could explain why , even though he lived down the street from the Lewis family , producer Snuff Garrett was n't aware of Gary Lewis ' band until a mutual friend , conductor Les Brown , informed him that the band was playing at Disneyland , and that Garrett should give them a listen . Seeing an opportunity to capitalize on the Lewis name , Garrett put Lewis 's band into the studio to develop , still with the finances of Lewis ' mother . Garrett pushed Lewis to improve his drumming skill , even getting Buddy Rich to tutor him , and , more importantly , made Lewis the singer , and therefore the focal point of the group . By Lewis 's own admission , his natural singing voice was not one of his strengths , and this led Garrett to employ vocal overdubbing tricks in the studio to flesh it out . `` This Diamond Ring '' , hitting number one on Billboard magazine 's Hot 100 chart on February 20 , 1965 , made Lewis an instant star . Lewis was Cash Box magazine 's 1965 `` Male Vocalist of the Year . '' Besides the Lovin ' Spoonful , he was the only artist during the 1960s to have his first seven releases each reach the Top 10 of the Hot 100 . In addition to `` This Diamond Ring '' his hits include `` Count Me In '' ( the only non-British Commonwealth record in Hot 100 's Top 10 on 8 May 1965 , at # 2 ) , `` She 's Just My Style '' , and `` Everybody Loves a Clown '' . By 1966 , Lewis had stopped drumming all together , and was exclusively singing , replaced at drums by , among others , Jim Keltner . His career was put on hold when he entered the U.S. Army as a draftee in January 1967 , and he served in the Vietnam War to 1968 . He returned to performing and recording but did not recapture his earlier success and five releases by the band that year peaked from 13th to 39th . His musical career was later marketed as a `` nostalgia act '' with appearances ( continuing As of 2010 ) on his father 's Labor Day Telethons for the Muscular Dystrophy Association . He appeared uncredited in his father 's film The Nutty Professor ( 1963 ) . He also appeared in a credited role singing `` The Land of Tra-la-la '' with his father in Rock-a-Bye Baby ( 1958 ) , where he represented Jerry Lewis as a boy . He also was seen in the movie The Family Jewels . Following his stint in Vietnam , Lewis retired from music , operating a music shop in San Fernando Valley in 1971 , and giving drumming lessons . A brief attempt at starting a new band called `` Medecine '' , with Billy Cowsill of The Cowsills in 1974 did not go anywhere . It was not until the 1980s when Lewis starting touring again , with various incarnations of The Playboys , generally featuring no original members . Lewis and his family reside in Honeoye Falls , New York .

The National Book Awards are a set of American literary awards . Started in 1950 , the Awards are presented annually to American authors for literature published in the current year . In 1989 the National Book Foundation , a nonprofit organization which now oversees and manages the National Book Awards , was established . The mission of the National Book Foundation is `` to celebrate the best of American literature , to expand its audience , and to enhance the cultural value of good writing in America . '' The awards ceremony is held each November in New York City . National Book Awards are given in each of four categories : fiction , nonfiction , poetry , and young people 's literature . Awards have been given in various other categories since 1950 , but they have since been retired or subsumed into the remaining categories . The National Book Foundation also presents two lifetime achievement awards each year : the `` Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters '' and the `` Literarian Award . '' Only publishers can submit books for the National Book Award . Each category is overseen by an independent and expert five-member judging panel . Panels typically consider hundreds of books per category each year . A total of twenty Finalists ( five per category ) are announced in October . A chair from each panel announces the Winner during the `` National Book Awards Ceremony and Dinner '' held in November . Winners each receive a $ 10,000 cash prize and a bronze sculpture ; Finalists each receive $ 1,000 , a medal , and a citation from the panel jury . The Foundation has expanded its celebration of American literature by creating National Book Awards Week . Beginning with 5 Under 35 , which spotlights emerging fiction writers as selected and introduced by National Book Award Winners and Finalists . The event calendar continues with the National Book Awards Teen Press Conference , the private National Book Awards Medal Ceremony , and the National Book Awrd Finalists Reading , and culminates in the Awards Ceremony , focusing attention on the best writing in America . The `` Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters '' ( DCAL ) is a lifetime achievement award . The medal comes with a cash prize of $ 10,000 . The recipient is a person who `` has enriched American literary heritage over a life of service , or a corpus of work . '' The `` Literarian Award '' is a lifetime achievement award . It is `` presented to an individual for outstanding service to the American literary community , whose life and work exemplify the goals of the National Book Foundation to expand the audience for literature and to enhance the cultural value of literature in America .

A virtuoso ( from Italian virtuoso , Late Latin virtuosus , Latin virtus meaning : skill , manliness , excellence ) is an individual who possesses outstanding technical ability in the fine arts , at singing or playing a musical instrument . The plural form is either virtuosi or the Anglicisation , virtuosos , and the feminine form sometimes used is virtuosa . Virtuosi are often musical composers as well . During the age of Baroque music many composers were also virtuosi on their respective instruments . '' ... a virtuoso was , originally , a highly accomplished musician , but by the nineteenth century the term had become restricted to performers , both vocal and instrumental , whose technical accomplishments were so pronounced as to dazzle the public . '' The defining element of virtuosity is the performance ability of the musician in question , who is capable of displaying feats of skill well above the average performer . Musicians focused on virtuosity are commonly criticized for overlooking substance and emotion in favor of raw technical prowess . Despite the mechanical aspects of virtuosity , many virtuosi successfully avoid such labels , focusing simultaneously on other musical aspects while writing and to be a scientist . Once more commonly applied in the context of the fine arts , the term has since evolved and can now also simply mean a ` master ' or ` ace ' who excels technically within a particular field or area of human knowledgeâ '' anyone especially or dazzlingly skilled at what they do . The Italian term of `` virtuoso '' was also once commonly used to describe the group of emerging ballistic experts , engineers , artillerists , and specialists in mechanics and dynamics that arose during the late 17th century in response to the spreading use of gunpowder in Europe . The meaning of virtuoso has its roots in the Italian usage of the 16th and 17th centuries , signifying an honorific term reserved for a person distinguished in any intellectual or artistic field . The term evolved with time , simultaneously broadening and narrowing in scope as interpretations went in and out of fashion and debates unravel . Originally a musician was honored the classification by being a composer , theorist or famous maestro , more importantly than being a skilled performer . The 17th and 18th centuries saw a bastardization of the term , which started being self indulged by a great number of musicians , without considerations of merit . SÃ bastien de Brossard in his Dictionaire de Musique ( Paris , 1703 ) approached the word virtuoso by its Latin root virtu emphasizing exceptional training , especially in theory . This position was also defended in Johann Gottfried Walther 's Musicalisches Lexicon ( 1732 ) favoring the theorist over the performer . Johan Matthenson 's Der brauchbare Virtuoso ( 1720 ) maintained the respect for the traditional `` theoretische Virtuosen '' ( virtuoso theoretical ) but also paid tribute to the `` virtuosi prattici '' ( performer virtuoso ) . Johann Kuhnau in his The Musical Charlatan ( Der musikalische Quack-Salber , 1700 ) defined the `` true virtuoso '' once again emphasizing theory ( `` der wahre Virtuose '' ) describing the `` highly gifted musician '' ( `` der glÃ 1\/4 ckselige Musicus '' ) or `` performer virtuoso '' as having nothing more than practical facility . In the late 18th century the term started to be used to describe the musician , instrumentalist or vocalist , who pursued a career as a soloist . The tension about the merit of practical virtuosity started to grow at the same time and intensified in the 19th century , only to remain an open debate since then . Franz Liszt declared that `` virtuosity is not an outgrowth , but an indispensable element of music '' ( Gesammelte Schriften , iv , 1855 â `` 9 ) . Richard Wagner opposed the triviality and exhibitionist talents of the performer voicing his opinion strongly : `` The real dignity of the virtuoso rests solely on the dignity he is able to preserve for creative art ; if he trifles and toys with this , he casts his honor away . He is the intermediary of the artistic idea '' ( Gesammelte Schriften ; English translation , vii , 1894 â `` 9 , p. 112 ) . Pejorative connotations started in this epoch exemplified by new German expressions such as `` Virtuosenmachwerk '' ( piece of routine display ) . `` Pultvirtuoso '' ( conductor with virtuoso qualities ) , on the other hand , is not pejorative , but complimentary .
The British Rail Class 45 also known as the Sulzer Type 4 diesel locomotives were built by British Rail at their Derby and Crewe Works between 1960 and 1962 . Along with the similar Class 44 and 46 locomotives they became known as `` Peaks '' . The Class 45s became the main traction on the Midland mainline from 1962 and their introduction allowed considerable acceleration of the previous steam powered service . The Class 45s remained the main source of power on the Midland mainline up to 1982 when they were relegated to secondary services following introduction of HSTs on the route . From 1986 Class 45s virtually disappeared from the line . From the early 1980s until their withdrawal c. 1988 the class were regular performers on the North Trans-Pennine line working services from Liverpool Lime Street to York , Scarborough or Newcastle via Manchester Victoria , Huddersfield and Leeds . These trains were usually formed of early mark 2 carriages of up to seven in a typical train . The engine of the Class 45 was a marine type slow revving diesel , a Sulzer 12LDA28B with a bore of 280 mm and a stroke of 360 mm . This gave 22 litre per cylinder or 264 litres for the whole engine . The unit was turbo charged and intercooled and gave 2500 hp at 750 rpm . The layout of the engine was in two banks of 6 cylinders and was unusual in that it was not a V type , i.e. sharing the same crankshaft , but two parallel banks of 6 cylinders geared together from two separate output shafts . Six cylinder versions of the engine were fitted in the Class 25 locos ( amongst others ) and eight cylinder versions in Class 33s . Class 45s were the updated versions of the Class 44 locomotives , the latter having a 2300 hp non-intercooled version of the same engine . i.e. the 12LDA28A . The later Class 47 had a modified version of the same engine , a 12LDA28C . When initially put into service , the locomotives were fitted with multi-unit working and steam heating boilers for passenger service . In the early 1970s , fifty were fitted with electric train supply in place of their steam heating boilers and assigned to work services on the Midland Main Line from London St Pancras to Nottingham , Derby and Sheffield . These locomotives were renumbered as Class 45\/1 . The great majority of Class 45s were withdrawn between 1981 and 1988 and the last was withdrawn from service by 1989 . Eleven locomotives survive in preservation . A quick summary of these is as follows ( a more detailed study can be found in the table above ) : A twelfth example , 45015 , was also sold into preservation , but not restored . Withdrawn in March 1986 with a seized traction motor , for which repair was not authorised , 45015 was heavily cannibalised for spares to keep other Class 45s working . It remained at Toton , its home shed , until at least 1999 . The locomotive was moved to Shackerstone , on the Battlefield Line Railway , in 2002 , still with the intention of restoration to mainline standard , despite requiring a replacement engine to be found . In 2010 the host railway gave notice to the locomotive 's owner that the still-unrestored 45015 needed to move to a new site . Having failed to find a buyer , it is likely that 45015 will be sold for scrap , although , as at November 2010 , the derelict loco was still at Shackerstone .

As the world 's largest country , a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , regional power in Europe and Asia and the principal successor state to the Soviet Union , the Russian Federation hosts a large diplomatic community in its capital city of Moscow . 147 embassies are resident , with numerous countries maintaining consulates general and consulates throughout the country .
Relief is a sculptural technique . The term relief is from the Latin verb levo , to raise . To create a sculpture in relief is thus to give the impression that the sculpted material has been raised above the background plane . What is actually performed is a lowering of the field , leaving the unsculpted parts seemingly raised . The technique thus involves considerable chiselling away of the background , which is a time-consuming exercise with little artistic effect when applied to the background further away from the immediate vicinity of the depicted form itself . To overcome this requirement the technique of `` sunken relief '' was developed , where the relief itself was sunk into the field . Sculpture in true relief is only possible where material is added to the plane and built up therefrom , as in the case of papier-mache relief sculpture , where the technique is quite literally to raise up the depicted form . The technique of embossing achieves a similar result . There are different degrees of relief depending on the degree of projection of the sculpted form from the field , for which the Italian appellations are commonly used : high relief ( alto-rilievo ) , mid-relief ( mezzo-rilievo ) , low-relief ( basso-rilievo , or French : bas-relief ) and rilievo stiacciato , where the plane is scarcely more than scratched in order to remove background material . Thus it is possible to have a sunken relief in any of the 4 preceding styles . The opposite of relief sculpture is `` counter-relief '' , intaglio or cavo-rilievo where the field or background is left intact and the form itself is removed . It is thus not a raising of the form , but a lowering . Reliefs are common throughout the world , for example on the walls of monumental buildings . The frieze in the classical Corinthian order is often enriched with bas-relief ( low relief ) . Alto-relievo ( high relief ) can be seen in the pediments of classical temples such as the Parthenon . Several panels or sections of relief together may represent a sequence of scenes . There are three main types of relief . The distinction between high and low relief is somewhat subjective , and the two are very often combined in a single work . In particular , most `` high reliefs '' contain sections in low relief . ( Hyphens may or may not be used in all these terms . ) A bas-relief ( `` low relief '' , , from the Italian basso rilievo ) or low relief is a projecting image with a shallow overall depth , for example used on coins , on which all images are in low relief . It is a technique which requires less work , and is therefore cheaper to produce , as less of the background needs to be removed . However its main use is to convey a sense of distance , or to give depth to the composition , especially for scenes with many figures and a landscape or architectural background , in the same way that lighter colors are used for the same purpose in painting . Thus figures in the foreground are sculpted in high-relief , those in the background in low-relief . Bas-relief may use any medium or technique of sculpture , stone carving and metal casting being most common . High relief ( or alto rilievo , from Italian ) is where in general more than half the mass of the sculpted figure projects from the background , indeed the most prominent elements of the composition may even be undercut detatching them completely from the field . All cultures and periods in which large sculptures were created used this technique . It is seen in `` monumental sculpture '' and architecture from ancient times to present . Sunken relief is where the image is made by sinking the relief sculpture itself into a flat surface . The images are usually mostly linear in nature . It is most notably associated with the art of Ancient Egypt , where reliefs appear on massive and expansive walls . To cut back all the background would be extremely time-consuming , therefore the individual compositions themselves , often in the form of hieroglyphs , were themselves set in to the stone field . The technique to be successful needs strong sunlight to emphasise the forms by shadow . The technique is not to be confused with `` counter-relief '' or intaglio .

Mean orbital elements are the averages calculated by the numerical integration of current elements over a long period of time , used to determine the dynamical families . The Carme group is a group of retrograde irregular satellites of Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Carme and are thought to have a common origin . Their semi-major axes ( distances from Jupiter ) range between 22.9 and 24.1 Gm , their orbital inclinations between 164.9 Â and 165.5 Â , and their orbital eccentricities between 0.23 and 0.27 ( with one exception ) . The International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) reserves names in - e for all retrograde moons , including this group 's members . The very low dispersion of the mean1 orbital elements among the core members ( the group is separated by less than 700,000 km in semi major axis and less than 0.7 Â in inclination ) suggests that the Carme group may once have been a single body that was broken apart by an impact . The dispersion can be explained by a very small velocity impulse ( 5 ( Î V ( 50 m\/s ) . The parent body was probably about the size of Carme , 46 km in diameter ; 99 % of the group 's mass is still located in Carme . Further support to the single body origin comes from the known colors : all2 the satellites appear light red , with color indices B-V = 0.76 and V-R = 0.47 and infrared spectra , similar to D-type asteroids . These data are consistent with a progenitor from the Hilda family or a Jupiter Trojan . 1Osculating orbital parameters of irregular satellites of Jupiter change widely in short intervals due to heavy perturbation by Jupiter . For example , changes of as much as 1 Gm in semi-major axis in 2 years , 0.5 in eccentricity in 12 years , and as much as 5 Â in 24 years have been reported . Mean orbital elements are the averages calculated by the numerical integration of current elements over a long period of time , used to determine the dynamical families .

A scale height is a term often used in scientific contexts for a distance over which a quantity decreases by a factor of e ( the base of natural logarithms ) . It is usually denoted by the capital letter H. For planetary atmospheres , it is the vertical distance upwards , over which the pressure of the atmosphere decreases by a factor of e. The scale height remains constant for a particular temperature . It can be calculated by The pressure at the Earth 's surface ( or at higher levels ) is a result of the weight of the overlying atmosphere ( force per unit area ) . If at a height of z the atmosphere has density and pressure P , then moving upwards at an infinitesimally small height dz will decrease the pressure by amount dP , equal to the weight of a layer of atmosphere of thickness dz . where g is used to denote the acceleration due to gravity . For small dz it is possible to assume g to be constant ; the minus sign indicates that as the height increases the pressure decreases . Therefore using the equation of state for an ideal gas of mean molecular mass M at temperature T , the density can be expressed as such : which will not change unless the temperature does . Integrating the above and assuming where P0 is the pressure at height z = 0 ( pressure at sea level ) the pressure at height z can be written as : This translates as the pressure decreasing exponentially with height . In the Earth 's atmosphere , the pressure at sea level P0 averages about 1.01 Ã -- 105Pa , the mean molecular mass of dry air is 28.964 u and hence 28.964 1.660 Ã -- 10 27 = 4.808 Ã -- 10 26 kg , and g = 9.81 m\/s . As a function of temperature the scale height of the Earth 's atmosphere is therefore 1.38 \/ ( 4.808 9.81 ) Ã -- 103 = 29.26 m\/deg . This yields the following scale heights for representative air temperatures . These figures should be compared with the temperature and density of the Earth 's atmosphere plotted at NRLMSISE-00 , which shows the air density dropping from 1200 g\/m3 at sea level to 0.53 = .125 g\/m3 at 70 km , a factor of 9600 , indicating an average scale height of 70\/ln ( 9600 ) = 7.64 km , consistent with the indicated average air temperature over that range of close to 260 K.
Rezovski Creek ( 're - zov-ski po - ` tok ) is a melt-water stream located on Livingston Island , Antarctica . The 500 m long melt-water stream draining that portion of the northwestern slope of Balkan Snowfield located between Hesperides Hill , Atlantic Club Ridge , Krum Rock and Sinemorets Hill on Hurd Peninsula in eastern Livingston Island , South Shetland Islands in Antarctica . The arms of Rezovski Creek encompass the old buildings of the Bulgarian Base . Its lower course forms Grand Lagoon , and has its mouth at the southwest extremity of Bulgarian Beach used as embarkation place servicing St. Kliment Ohridski Base . A name of national geography ; Rezovska is a river in south-eastern Bulgaria . The name was established in use at the time of approval . The creek 's midpoint is located at ( Large scale Bulgarian mapping of the St. Kliment Ohridski Base vicinity from a topographic survey made from 31 January to 4 February 1996 ) .

A twig is a small thin terminal branch of a woody plant . Twigs are critically important in identification of trees , shrubs and vines , especially in wintertime . The buds on the twig are an important diagnostic characteristic , as are the abscission scars where the leaves have fallen away . The color , texture , and patterning of the twig bark are also important , in addition to the thickness and nature of any pith of the twig . There are two types of twig , vegetative twigs and fruiting spurs . Fruiting spurs are specialized twigs that generally branch off the sides of branches and leading twigs , and are stubby and slow-growing , with many annular ring markings from seasons past . The age and rate of growth of a twig can be determined by counting the winter terminal bud scale scars , or annular ring marking , down the length of the twig . Are also these are as the many resources for utility or useful to others .
`` There must always be values at the heart of sport , and this is what we have to teach children . '' Pablo Oscar Cavallero RodrÃ guez ( born April 13 , 1974 in Lomas de Zamora , Buenos Aires Province ) is a retired Argentine footballer , who played as a goalkeeper . Eight years of his professional career were spent in Spain , with three different clubs , namely Celta de Vigo . During his career , Cavallero played for Club AtlÃ tico VÃ lez SÃ rsfield , UniÃ n de Santa Fe , RCD Espanyol , Celta de Vigo and Valencian Levante UD ( the last three in Spain 's La Liga ) . During his time with Celta , he won the Ricardo Zamora Trophy in 2002 â `` 03 , as the Galician side eventually reached the UEFA Champions League . He allowed 27 goals in 34 games , a goals-per-match average of 0.79 .

The 1958 Formula One season was the ninth season of FIA Formula One motor racing . It featured the 1958 World Championship of Drivers which commenced on January 19 , 1958 , and ended on October 19 after eleven races . This was the first Formula One season in which a Manufacturers title was awarded , the International Cup for F1 Manufacturers being contested concurrently with the World Championship of Drivers . Englishman Mike Hawthorn won the Drivers title after a close battle with compatriot Stirling Moss and Vanwall won the Manufacturers award from Ferrari . The season was one of the most important and tragic seasons in Formula One 's history . Although the engine formula remained the same , minimum race lengths were reduced to 300 kilometres or two hours , and the use of commercial petrol became compulsory , in place of specialized alcohol-based racing fuels . The International Cup for F1 Manufacturers was awarded for the first time , but Ferrari 's Mike Hawthorn won the driver 's championship from Stirling Moss , despite the latter having won four of the ten grand prix to Hawthorn 's one . Rear-engined Cooper-Climaxes , entered by the private owner Rob Walker , shocked the establishment by winning two early-season races : Moss , driving for Walker in Argentina because Vanwall had not entered , beat the Ferraris by superior race craft , and Maurice Trintignant outlasted the opposition at Monaco . Moss ' teammate at Vanwall , Tony Brooks also won three races , his success in the Italian race , overtaking Hawthorn after Moss had retired , ensured the title went to the final round in Morocco . Moss needed to win , with a fastest lap and Hawthorn third or lower to win the title . With Moss leading , Brooks and team-mate Stuart Lewis-Evans attempted to hold Hawthorn in third , however both their engines failed - Lewis-Evans ' tragically resulting in severe burns he did not recover from . Hawthorn finished second to win his first title , his greater consistency and reliability , along with crucial points for fastest laps , giving him the title by a single point . Vanwall won the inaugural Constructors Competition , mere consolation following the events in Morocco . Hawthorn retired after winning the Championship , but died in a road accident in early 1959 . His death compounded a tragic season for Formula One , after Luigi Musso died in the French Grand Prix , Peter Collins a month later in the German Grand Prix - just two weeks after winning his home race , and Lewis-Evans in hospital following his fire in Morocco . Maria Teresa de Filippis became the first woman to drive in a world championship event . Reigning five-time Champion Juan Manuel Fangio , the dominant driver of the 1950s and one of the greatest of all time , competed in only two races as a privateer , retiring after the French Grand Prix . The following teams and drivers competed in the 1958 FIA World Championship . Points were awarded on an 8-6-4-3-2 basis to the first five finishers at each race . An additional point was awarded to the driver setting the fastest race lap . The best six results from the eleven races were retained . Points were awarded on an 8-6-4-3-2 basis to the first five finishers at each race . However a manufacturer only received points for its highest placed car and only the best six results from the ten races were retained . Other Formula One races also held in 1958 , which did not count towards the World Championship .
Post-disco ( club music or dance ) is the significant period in popular music history that followed the commercial `` death '' of disco music that emerged during late 1970s and early 1980s . The stripped-down musical trends followed from the DJ - and producer-driven , increasingly electronic and experimental side of disco , and were typified by the styles of dance-pop , boogie , italo disco and the early alternative dance . Techno and house are both rooted in post-disco music . Unlike disco music , post-disco is usually without typical shuffling hi-hat driven beat , walking basslines and\/or string orchestration ; it more features drum machines , synthesizers , sequencers and 4\/4 time . Soulful vocals , however , `` stayed '' in this new disco music . Post-disco is not underground music at all â '' Madonna , New Order , Pet Shop Boys built their careers on the new ideas of disco electronic `` reincarnation '' . Larry Levan used dub techniques in his productions and mixes for various post-disco artists , including his own group The Peech Boys . Sinnamon 's `` Thanks To You '' , D-Train 's `` You 're the One for Me '' , The Peech Boys ' `` Do n't Make Me Wait '' â '' all these songs and its attributes and trends of post-disco later influenced a new `` never-before-heard '' music style . The house music . DJs , mixers , producers who were experimented with the new sounds are for example Leroy Burgess , Nick Martinelli , Arthur Baker , FranÃ ois Kevorkian , Larry Levan , Ron Hardy , Frankie Knuckles , Tom Moulton , Shep Pettibone , Kashif . Example of pop rock , electronic and R&B musicians who followed post-disco wave include Black Devil , Telex , D. Train , Patrice Rushen , Freeez , Mtume , Nick Straker Band , Skyy , Unlimited Touch , Kurtis Blow , Was ( Not Was ) , Material , Liquid Liquid , Imagination , Bobby O , Shannon , Cheryl Lynn , Stacy Lattisaw , Central Line , Chas Jankel , Aurra , B. B. & Q. Band , Level 42 , The Limit , Timex Social Club , The Deele , Dayton , The SOS Band , Shalamar , Shakatak , Instant Funk , The Whispers and many others . Post-disco albums , featuring these `` new sounds '' , include New York Cake ( 1981 ) by Kano , Thriller ( 1982 ) by Michael Jackson , Straight from the Heart ( 1982 ) by Patrice Rushen and Madonna ( 1983 ) by Madonna . After the `` Disco Sucks '' movement , disco records were rejected from the airplay and its circulation have been stopped . Radio stations started to play other formats of music like reggae , punk rock or new wave . Top mainstream labels and record companies like Casablanca , TK Records , RSO started to have financial problems . However , disco does n't `` give up '' , because of its electronic progression and splitting itself in subscenes and styles like Hi-NRG , freestyle , italo-disco and electro-funk ( boogie ) . The last one is closely associated with post-disco more than any other offshots of post-disco . A watershed album of post-disco was Michael Jackson 's Off The Wall ( produced by Quincy Jones ) , which helped establish a direction of R&B \/ dance music and influenced many young producers who were interested in this kind of new music . Parliament-Funkadelic , a funk band , also set the tone for many post-disco and post-punk bands of the 1980s and 1990s . The term `` post-disco '' was used in 1984 by Cadence Magazine when defining post-disco soul as disco without the loud bass-drum thump . `` Post-disco '' is also an Allmusic editorial contributor 's attempt to isolate a music genre in the era between the indistinct `` end '' of disco music and the equally indistinct emergence of house music . Later in the 2000s , Daft Punk , a house musical group , adopted post-disco , disco and synthpop sounds of early 1980s to their album Discovery , another artist Les Rythmes Digitales was influenced by post-disco\/electro scene of the early 1980s . The Canadian musical group Chromeo debuted in 2004 by 80s-influenced electrofunk\/boogie album She 's in Control . The Perfect Beats series ( Vol . Another compilation series are Nighttime lovers ( Vol . The 1980s post-disco sounds also inspired many Norwegian dance music producers . Some rappers such as Ice Cube or EPMD built their careers on post-disco funk music ( they were inspired for example by dance-floor favorites like Zapp and Cameo ) . Also Sean `` Puffy '' Combs has been influenced by post-disco R&B in an indirect way . Another post-disco movement is connected with post-punk\/no wave genres with fewer R&B \/ funk influences . An example of this `` post-disco '' is Gina X 's `` No G.D.M. '' and artists like Liquid Liquid , Polyrock , Dinosaur L , and Disco Not Disco ( 2000 ) compilation album . This movement also connects with dance-oriented rock ; Michael Campbell , in his book Popular Music in America defines that genre as `` post-punk\/post-disco fusion . '' Campbell also cited Robert Christgau , who described dance-oriented rock ( or DOR ) as umbrella term used by various DJs in 1980s .

Melody Time is a 1948 animated feature produced by Walt Disney and released to theaters by RKO Radio Pictures on May 27 , 1948 . Made up of several sequences set to popular music and folk music , the film is , like Make Mine Music before it , the popular music version of Fantasia ( an ambitious film that proved to be a commercial disappointment upon its original theatrical release ) . Melody Time , while not meeting the artistic accomplishments of Fantasia , was a mildly successful film in its own right . It is the tenth animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series and the fifth package film following Saludos Amigos , The Three Caballeros , Make Mine Music , and Fun and Fancy Free . This particular film has seven segments . This segment featured Frances Langford singing the title song about two romantic young lovers in December . The boy shows off on the ice for his girl , and near-tragedy and a timely rescue ensues . Like several other segments of these package films , Once Upon a Wintertime was later released theatrically as an individual short , in this case on September 17 , 1954 . This short was also featured in Very Merry Christmas Songs which is part of Disney Sing Along Songs as a background movie for the song Jingle Bells . This segment was a surrealistic nightmare for a solitary bee trying to escape from a visual and musical frenzy . The music was courtesy of Freddy Martin and his orchestra ( with Jack Fina playing the piano ) and was a swing-jazz variation of Rimsky-Korsakov 's Flight of the Bumblebee , which was one of the many pieces considered for inclusion in Fantasia . This segment was a retelling of the story of John Chapman , who spent most of his life roaming Mid-Western America ( mainly Illinois and Indiana ) in the pioneer days , and planting apple trees , thus earning his famous nickname . Dennis Day narrated and provides all the voices . This segment was released independently on December 25 , 1955 as just Johnny Appleseed . This segment was based on the story also titled Little Toot by Hardie Gramatky , in which the title protagonist , a small tugboat , wanted to be just like his father Big Toot , but could n't seem to stay out of trouble . The Andrews Sisters provided the vocals . Out of all the musical segments , this one was the most famous . This segment was a reciting of the famous Alfred Joyce Kilmer poem by Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians with the lyrical setting seen through the seasons . This segment has Donald Duck and JosÃ Carioca meeting with the Aracuan Bird who introduced them to the pleasures of the samba . The accompanying music is the 1914 polka Apanhei-te , Cavaquinho by Ernesto Nazareth fitted with English lyrics . The Dinning Sisters provided the vocals while organist Ethel Smith played the organ . This segment was the finale about the famous hero from Texas , the biggest and best cowboy that ever lived , his horse Widowmaker , and how he was brought back down to earth by a woman named Slue-Foot Sue . This retelling of the story was courtesy of Roy Rogers , Bob Nolan , and the Sons of the Pioneers to Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten . This segment was later edited on the film 's NTSC video release ( but not the PAL release ) to remove all scenes of Bill smoking a cigarette . The entire scene with Bill rolling the smoke and lighting it with a lightning bolt was cut and all other shots of the offending cigarette hanging from his lips were digitally removed . Melody Time was first released in Japan on laserdisc on January 25 , 1987 , and on VHS on June 2 , 1998 , under the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection title .

Spiekeroog is one of the East Frisian Islands , off the North Sea coast of Germany . It is situated between Langeoog to its west , and Wangerooge to its east . The island belongs to the district of Wittmund , in Lower Saxony in Germany . The only village on the island is also called Spiekeroog . Spiekeroog covers an area of 18.25 kmÂ , the shortest distance to the mainland is 5.7 km . The island is - with the exception of fire and rescue vehicles - free of cars . A daily ferry service from the harbor of Neuharlingersiel connects the island with the German mainland . The origin of the name `` Spiekeroog '' is disputed . Today , most of its people tend to believe that it is a translation of `` storage island '' . Spiekeroog was first mentioned in 1398 as the island of Spiekeroch . At that time , it was a hiding place for pirates . They were supported by the islanders , but were not averse to robbing them too . In 1625 , 13 families lived on the island , making a living from farming , fishing and the production of muschelkalk or shell-bearing limestone . In later years , whaling and shipping became increasingly important to the island . During the Napoleonic occupation , shipping came to a halt due to the blockade against England which led to great poverty . Smuggling goods to and from the then English Heligoland was the only source of income during that time . In 1812 , England attacked the French settlements on the island , but was repelled . At the beginning of the 19th century , the idea of coastal resorts - having originated in England - became popular among the German North Sea islands . The first coastal resort was founded 1797 on the island of Norderney . Since 1820 , guests have been using Spiekeroog for holidays . A weekly ferry service was established from Neuharlingersiel in 1792 and , since 1842 , the service has operated on a daily basis . To improve the comfort of tourists and guests , a 1.7 km long horse-drawn railway was built in 1885 between the village and the western beach . It was extended in 1892 to the newly-built harbor in the southwest of the island . This horse-drawn railway was replaced by diesel trains on May , 31st , 1949 which makes it the last horse-drawn railway in Germany . Spiekeroog was a frequent vacation destination for various German presidents . Gustav Heinemann , Richard von WeizsÃ cker and Johannes Rau ( who got married on the island ) spent their holidays here . As a North Sea coastal resort the island is home to various health institutions including a wellness center , a mother\/child health center and an island spa . Spiekeroog has a capacity of 3,500 beds for guests - counting all hotels , pensions , private rooms , vacation apartments and health and leisure centres . According to a 2003 survey , 64,000 tourists visit the island yearly , with 554,000 overnight stays and 81,000 daytime visitors . The average stay on the island is 5.8 days . Beside hotels , pensions and vacation apartments , there is a campsite on the western part of the island . It is open from May to September . The `` Old Island Church '' ( Protestant ) was built in 1696 and is therefore the oldest of all the churches on the East Frisian Islands . The portrait of the Virgin Mary within the church is supposed to have come from a ship of the Spanish Armada that was stranded on Spiekeroog in 1588 . Drinkeldodenkarkhof , also known as `` Cemetery of the Homeless '' is the graveyard for the 84 victims from the sinking of the ship Johanne in 1854 . The Island Museum shows historical artefacts from the island , the development of the coastal resort and the nature on the island . The Shell Museum at Kogge House has an exhibition of 2000 shells from all over the world . From April to September ( depending on holiday times ) , a horse-drawn railway operates between the old railway station and Westend .

The subfamily Spiraeoideae is a subfamily of flowering plants in the order Rosales . Most are shrubs , but there are some herbs ( and there are some trees in subtribe Pyrinae and in tribe Amygdaleae ) . Most have simple leaves , but the genera Aruncus , Sorbaria ( and Sorbus in subtribe Pyrinae ) have pinnately compound leaves . Carpels are few ( 1 , or usually 2-5 ) . Most genera traditionally placed in the Spiraeoideae produce flowers with distinct follicles that , upon seed-set , mature to form fruits that are aggregates of follicles , but recent molecular data indicates that the traditional subfamily Maloideae with pome fruit , and the traditional subfamily Prunoideae\/Amygdaloideae with drupe fruit should be included within the Spiraeoideae , as subtribe Pyrinae and tribe Amygdaleae respectively . The taxonomy of this subfamily has changed several times in the last century as more detailed studies have been carried out . Most recently molecular data have been incorporated .

J.F.C. Fuller , in his The Decisive Battles of the Western World , writes of the outcome of Leyte Gulf : The Ottoman Dynasty ( or the Imperial House of Osman ) ruled the Ottoman Empire from 1299 to 1922 , beginning with Osman I ( not counting his father , ErtuÄ rul ) , though the dynasty was not proclaimed until Orhan Bey declared himself sultan . Before that the tribe\/dynasty might have been known as SÃ Ä Ã 1\/4 t but was renamed OsmanlÄ ( Ottoman in English ) in honor of Osman . The sultan was the sole and absolute regent , head of state and head of government of the empire , at least officially , though often much power shifted de facto to other officials , especially the Grand Vizier . See the article on state organization of the Ottoman Empire for further information on the sultan and the structure of power . The Ottoman dynasty is known in Turkish as OsmanlÄ , meaning `` House of Osman '' . The first rulers of the dynasty never had called themselves sultans , but rather beys , or `` chieftain '' , roughly the Turkic equivalent of Emir , which would itself become a gubernatorial title and even a common military or honorific rank . Thus they still formally acknowledged the sovereignty of the contemporary Seljuk Sultanate of RÃ '' m and its successor , the Ilkhanate . The first Ottoman to actually claim the title of sultÃ cents n was Murad I , who ruled from 1359 to 1389 . The title sultan ( Ø Ù Ø Ø Ù ) â '' in Arabic , was in later Arabic-Islamic dynasties originally the power behind the throne of the Caliph in Bagdad and it was later used for various independent Muslim Monarchs . This title was more prestigious then Emir ; it was not comparable to the title of Malik ` king ' or the originally Persian title of Shah . With the Conquest of Constantinople in 1453 , the road was open for the Ottoman state to become an empire , with Sultan Mehmed II taking the title of pÃ cents diÅ ah ( Ù 3\/4 Ø Ø Ø Ø Ù ) , a Persian title meaning `` lord of kings '' claiming superiority to the other kings , that title was abandoned when the empire declined and lost its former might . In addition to such secular titles , the Ottoman sultan became the Caliph of Islam , starting with Selim I , who became khalif after the death of the last Abbasid Caliph Al-Mutawakkil III , the last of Abbasid Caliphs in Cairo . In Europe , Ottoman padishah was often referred to informally by such terms unrelated to the Ottoman protocol as the Grand Turk and the Grand Signor . The sultans further adopted in time many secondary formal titles as well , such as `` Sovereign of the House of Osman '' , `` Sultan of Sultans '' ( roughly King of Kings ) , and `` Khan of Khans '' . As the empire grew , sultans adopted secondary titles expressing the empire 's claim to be the successor in law of the structures of the absorbed states . Furthermore they tended to enumerate even regular provinces , not unlike the long lists of - mainly inherited - feudal titles in the full style of many Christian European monarchs . Some early Ottoman Sultans even had to accept the vassal status in the eyes of a foreign kingmaker . For example , Tamerlane appointed in 1402 the Ottoman Sultan ( deposed in 1410 ) Sulayman Chelebi Khan , who was styled as-Sultan ul-Azam , Sayyid us-Saladin ul-Arab wal Ajam , Malik ur-Rikaab ul-Umam , Ghiyas ud-Daula wa ud-Dunya , Sultan ul-Islam was ul-Muslimin , as-Sultan ibni us-Sultan , Hasib-i-Nasib-I-Zaman , Amir of Rumelia . Again his brother , who ended the Interregnum after the defeat of Ottomans to Tamerlane , Mehmed I also held his post with a fief from Tamerlane . However the next Ottoman ruler ( 6th Sultan of House of Osman ) was Sultan Murad Khan II ( 1421 - 1451 ) took the title Abu ' l Hayrat , Sultan ul-Mujahidin , Khan of Khans , Grand Sultan of Anatolia and Rumelia , and of the Cities of Edirne and Filibe . When Mehmed II conquered Constantinople on May 29 , 1453 , he claimed the title Emperor of the Roman Empire and protector of the Eastern Orthodox Church . He appointed the Patriarch of Constantinople Gennadius Scholarius , whom he protected and whose stature he elevated into leader of all the Eastern Orthodox Christians . As emperor of the Romans he laid claim to all Roman territories , which at the time before the Fall of Constantinople , however , extended to little more than the city itself , plus some areas in Morea ( Peloponnese ) and the Empire of Trebizond . The conqueror of Constantinople was Sultan Mehmed II Fatih Ghazi ` Abu ' l Fath ( 1451 - 1481 , 7th Sovereign of the House of Osman ) , was still ` simply ' styled Kaysar-i-Rum ( = Emperor of ( Byzantium = the second ) Rome , Caesar of Rome ) , Khan of Khans , Grand Sultan of Anatolia and Rumelia , Emperor of the three Cities of Constantinople , Edirne and Bursa , Lord of the two lands and the two seas and the first to adopt the ` imperial ' style Padishah . Around 1500 the full style of naming of the ruling Sultan had become practically stabilised , e.g. in 1601 Sultan Mehmed III was called :

Leslie is the home of the Qumran Bet Community , one of only a few Karaite Jewish communities outside Israel . In 1819 Arkansas was separated from Missouri , but still included in what is now Oklahoma . The two states were separated and Arkansas admitted to the Union in 1836 , just two years before Sam Leslie 's arrival . The Indians were peaceful and cooperative in Wiley 's Cove . There were two Indian chiefs in Samuel Leslie 's time : one called Wiley and the other was Al . . The Leslie area was called Wiley 's Cove after Chief Wiley , and Al 's Cove was in the Rumley area . Samuel built a small house on land in which he lived temporarily while the Indians moved aside , and then he built a two story southern type home with a separate kitchen and slave quarters . This house was located where the Legion Hut now stands ; the well at the north corner of the hut was the original well for the Samuel Leslie homestead . He also owned a store and trading post nearby . It is said he gave away some of the land to encourage other settlers to come into the community . The name Wiley 's Cove was changed to Leslie by the Postal Department on November 9 , 1887 . Andrew Jackson Leslie requested the name to be changed in honor of his father , Samuel Leslie .

At the Voyager 2 images Rosalind appears as an almost spherical object .
Psycho Circus is the 18th studio album by the American band Kiss . The album features the original four members back together , and in full make up . Some pressings featured a lenticular cover that alternates between a black Kiss logo and the album title with pictures of a clown and the band members while the Japan initial first pressing featured a pop-up cover which had 3 foam spring-loaded panels of a clown face and 2 others with band members faces that popped out when the doors were opened . The track `` You Wanted the Best '' is the only Kiss song in which lead vocals are shared by the entire lineup . Following Kiss ' highly successful 1996-1997 reunion tour , Psycho Circus was marketed as the first studio album by the band 's original lineup since 1979 's Dynasty ( as Peter Criss did not participate on 1980 's Unmasked ) . As with Dynasty and Unmasked , however , many of the songs were recorded by uncredited players . Guitarist Ace Frehley and drummer Peter Criss were used sparingly , with Criss only playing drums on `` Into the Void . '' ( He had also played on only one Dynasty song . ) Frehley played on only two songs from the album ( not including vocals ) . In a radio interview with Eddie Trunk following his departure Criss stated that only `` Into the Void '' featured instrumental contributions from all four members . Regarding the lack of cohesion in the group at the time of recording , Stanley stated `` We tried to do a Kiss album , and it was an ill-fated attempt because there was no real band , '' and continued by adding `` For a band to make a great album , it has to share a common purpose , and we didnâ t have it . '' Despite the controversy , Psycho Circus debuted at # 3 on the Billboard 200 , selling 110,000 copies in its first week of release , and was certified Gold by the RIAA on October 22 , 1998 . U.S. SoundScan sales of the album total 479,000 copies . `` We Are One '' peaked at # 4 on the Showbizz Magazine ( Brazil ) radio chart . A limited edition was released in Brazil on the wake of the Kiss concerts in the country , adding the second disc with live tracks , like the Japanese release , but without the bonus track `` In Your Face '' on the first disc . In Europe this expanded-release was tied-in with the tour , retaining the prismatic jewel-case of the original CD-release but adding a new sticker to the front and amended tray-insert .
Haute-Marne is a department in the northeast of France named after the Marne River . Haute-Marne is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on March 4 , 1790 . It was created from parts of the former provinces of Champagne , Burgundy , Lorraine and Franche-Comt Ã In March 1814 the departmental prefecture , Chaumont , was the unwitting witness to the end of the First Empire . On 1 March , Prussia , Russia , the United Kingdom and Austria signed an accord forbidding any individual peace deal with Napoleon I , and to fight until his final defeat . During World War II , Haute-Marne was partitioned under German occupation . The canal which runs from the Marne to the SaÃ ne served as a border , dividing the department into east and west . The east was a `` reserved zone '' , intended for the creation of a new German ( Ripuarian ) state , whereas to the west would be the traditional `` occupied zone '' . Haute-Marne was finally liberated by the Allies , in the form of the division of General Leclerc , between August and September 1944 . Haute-Marne is part of the region of Champagne-Ardenne and is surrounded by the departments of Meuse , Vosges , Haute-Sa Ã ne , CÃ te-d ` Or , Aube , and Marne . The nearest big cities are Paris , Nancy , Strasbourg , Basel , and Dijon . The highest mountain is Haut-du-Sac , in the Langres Plateau , in the southwest of the department , which rises to a height of 516 m ( 1,693 feet ) . The lowest points at 117m are found on the plains of Perthois and Der . The department is named after the Marne River , whose source is near Langres . This river covers 120 kilometres within the department . The department is to the east of the Parisian basin , and is characterised by a concentric sequence of cliff faces of varying geological origin , oriented northeast\/southwest . The fortified town of Langres , the Renaissance castle of Joinville , and the village of Colombey-les-deux - Ã glises are all major attractions .
The Tigris River ( Ë taÉ É rÉ s ) is the eastern member of the two great rivers that define Mesopotamia , the other being the Euphrates . The river flows south from the mountains of southeastern Turkey through Iraq . The Tigris is about 1,850 km long , rising in the Taurus Mountains of eastern Turkey about 25 km southeast of the city of Elazig and circa 30 km from the headwaters of the Euphrates River . The river then flows for 400 km through Turkish territory , before becoming the border between Syria and Iraq . This stretch of 44 km is the only part of the river that is located in Syria . The remaining 1,418 km are entirely within the Iraqi borders . The Tigris unites with the Euphrates near Basra , and from this junction to the Persian Gulf the mass of moving water is known as the Shatt-al-Arab . According to Pliny and other ancient historians , the Euphrates originally had its outlet into the sea separate from that of the Tigris . Baghdad , the capital of Iraq , stands on the banks of the Tigris . The port city of Basra straddles the Shatt al-Arab . In ancient times , many of the great cities of Mesopotamia stood on or near the Tigris , drawing water from it to irrigate the civilization of the Sumerians . Notable Tigris-side cities included Nineveh , Ctesiphon , and Seleucia , while the city of Lagash was irrigated by the Tigris via a canal dug around 2400 BC . Saddam Hussein 's hometown , Tikrit , is also located on the river and derives its name from it . The Tigris has long been an important transport route in a largely desert country . It is navigable as far as Baghdad by shallow-draft vessels , but rafts are needed for transport upstream to Mosul . River trade declined in importance during the 20th century as the Basra-Baghdad-Mosul railway and roads took over much of the freight traffic . The original Sumerian name was Idigna or Idigina , probably from \* id ( i ) gina `` running water '' , which can be interpreted as `` the swift river '' , contrasted to its neighbor , the Euphrates , whose leisurely pace caused it to deposit more silt and build up a higher bed than the Tigris . This form was borrowed and gave rise to Akkadian Idiqlat . From Old Persian TigrÄ , the word was adopted into Greek as Tigris ( '' Î Î Î Ï Î Ï '' which is also Greek for `` tiger '' ) . Pahlavi tigr means `` arrow '' , in the same family as Old Persian tigra - `` pointed '' ( compare tigra-xauda ) , Modern Persian tÃ z , tiz `` sharp '' . However , it does not appear that this was the original name of the river , but that it ( like the Semitic forms of the name ) was coined as an imitation of the indigenous Sumerian name . This is similar to the Persian name of the Euphrates , Ufratu , which does have a meaning in Persian , but is still modeled after the Akkadian name Purattu . Another name for the Tigris , used from the time of the Persian Empire , is Arvand Rud , literally Arvand River . Today the name Arvand Rud is the Persian name for the confluence of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers which in Arabic is called Shatt al-Arab . The Tigris is heavily dammed in Iraq and Turkey to provide water for irrigating the arid and semi-desert regions bordering the river valley . Damming has also been important for averting floods in Iraq , to which the Tigris has historically been notoriously prone following melting of snow in the Turkish mountains around April . Recent Turkish damming of the river has been the subject of some controversy , for both its environmental effects within Turkey and its potential to reduce the flow of water downstream . Mosul Dam , located on the Tigris , is the largest dam in Iraq . The Tigris appears twice in the Bible . In the Book of Genesis , the Tigris is the third of the four rivers branching off the river issuing out of the Garden of Eden . Daniel received one of his visions `` when I was by that great river the Tigris '' . In Sumerian mythology , the Tigris was created by the god Enki , who ejaculated and filled the river with flowing water . In Hittite and Hurrian mythology , Aranzah ( or Aranzahas in the Hittite nominative form ) is the Hurrian name of the Tigris River , which was divinized . He was the son of Kumarbi and the brother of Teshub and TaÅ miÅ u , one of the three gods spat out of Kumarbi 's mouth onto Mount Kanzuras . Later he colluded with Anu and the Teshub to destroy Kumarbi ( The Kumarbi Cycle ) .
Bernard Mendy ( born 20 August 1981 ) is a French footballer of Senegalese origin who plays for Danish club Odense Boldklub . He is a right back\/right wing-back who is known for his blistering pace and constant overlapping runs . Born in Ã vreux , Eure , a great fan of Paris Saint-Germain since his childhood , Mendy achieved his ambitions in 2000 when he joined PSG from SM Caen . Even though he had impressed a lot of people by his qualities during his first two seasons at PSG , he was loaned to Bolton Wanderers of England for a year , where he was appreciated for his offensive and speedy style . The new manager of PSG , Vahid Halilhodzic , decided to give him an opportunity to assert himself by using him as a first choice . That year , Mendy played one of his best seasons and was rewarded by playing his first match with the French national team against Brazil . However , he was not selected for the country 's 2006 FIFA World Cup roster . In 2008 , he scored the decisive goal in the final of the Coupe de la Ligue against RC Lens in a 2 â `` 1 victory , calmly stroking the ball home from the penalty spot . Mendy had stated his desire to return to England , to play for his favorite football club , Manchester United . Instead , on 20 June 2008 , it was reported by BBC Radio Humberside that Hull City had offered Mendy a three-year deal to join the newly promoted English club . He accepted the offer and joined Hull City for training in Italy . Hull manager Phil Brown had been assistant manager at Bolton during Mendy 's time there . He scored his first goal for Hull City , a lob against ironically , Manchester United , in a game they lost 4 â `` 3 . He was released from his contract on 17 May 2010 . On 9 February 2011 Mendy signed a 1 Â 1\/2 year contract with the Danish club Odense Boldklub ( OB ) having passed the medical examination . Mendy is currently married and has three daughters , Kayna , Iman and his third daughter was born in June 2010 . When at Hull City in the 2009-10 Barclays Premier League he received the 1st yellow card of the season against Chelsea in the 45 +1 minute and 30 seconds on the 15th August 2009 .
Neobatrachia are a suborder of the Anura , the order of frogs and toads . This suborder is the most advanced and apomorphic of the three anuran orders alive today ; hence its name , which literally means `` new frogs '' ( from the hellenic words `` neo '' , meaning `` new '' and `` batrachia '' meaning frogs ) . It is also by far the largest of the three ; its more than 5,000 different species make up over 96 % of all living anurans . The differentiation between Archaeobatrachia , Mesobatrachia , and Neobatrachia is mainly based primarily anatomic differences -- especially the skeletal structure -- , as well as several visible characteristics and behaviors . Separating the Anura into the Archaeo - , Meso - and Neobatrachia is somewhat controversial , and as more research is done and more knowledge is gained it is even becoming less clear , because many characteristics used for this differentiation apply to more than one group . Neobatrachia are usually sorted into five superfamilies . But this division is also controversial , as some families are placed into different superfamilies by different authors . In addition , several families have been revealed to be paraphyletic and consequently split up to make them correspond to clades and thus be natural , evolutionary groups . This has approximately doubled the number of presently-recognized neobatrachian families .
Psamathe , also known as Neptune X , is a retrograde irregular satellite of Neptune . The name is , or as in Latin PsamathÄ `` , Greek Î Î Î 1\/4 Î Î Î . It is named after Psamathe , one of the Nereids . This moon was discovered by Scott S. Sheppard and David C. Jewitt in 2003 using the 8.2 meter Subaru telescope . Before the announcement of its name on February 3 , 2007 ( IAUC 8802 ) , it was known by the provisional designation S\/2003 N 1 . This moon is about 38 kilometers in diameter . It orbits Neptune at a distance of about 46,695,000 km and requires almost 25 Earth years to make one orbit . The orbit of this satellite is close to the theoretical stable separation from Neptune for a body in a retrograde orbit . Given the similarity of this moon 's orbital parameters with Neso ( S\/2002 N 4 ) , it was suggested that both irregular satellites could have a common origin in the break-up of a larger moon . Both are further from their primary than any other known moon in the Solar System .

Danny Barker ( January 13 , 1909 â `` March 13 , 1994 ) , born Daniel Moses Barker , was a jazz banjoist , singer , guitarist , songwriter , ukelele player and author from New Orleans , founder of the locally famous Fairview Baptist Church Marching Band . He was a rhythm guitarist for some of the best bands of the day , including Cab Calloway , Lucky Millinder and Benny Carter throughout the 1930s . On September 4 , 1945 he recorded with Ohio 's native jazz pianistâ '' Sir Charles Thompsonâ '' a date that included saxophonists Dexter Gordon and Charlie Parker . Barker 's work with the Fairview Baptist Church Brass Band was pivotal in ensuring the longevity of jazz in New Orleans , producing generations of new talent . Brothers Wynton Marsalis and Branford Marsalis both played in the band as youths as well as `` The King of Treme '' Shannon Powell , Lucien Barbarin , Dr. Michael White and countless others . One of Barker 's earliest teachers in New Orleans was fellow banjoist Emanuel Sayles , whom he recorded with . Throughout his career , he played with Jelly Roll Morton , Baby Dodds , James P. Johnson , Sidney Bechet , Mezz Mezzrow , and Red Allen . He also toured and recorded with his wife , singer Blue Lu Barker . Danny Barker was born to a family of musicians in New Orleans in 1909 , the grandson of bandleader Isidore Barbarin and nephew of drummers Paul Barbarin and Louis Barbarin ; he first took up clarinet and drums before switching to a ukelele that his aunt got him , and then a banjo from his uncle or a trumpeter named Lee Collins . Barker began his career as a musician in his youth with his streetband the Boozan Kings and also toured Mississippi with Little Brother Montgomery . In 1930 he moved to New York City and switched to the guitar . On the day of his arrival in New York his uncle Paul took him to the Rhythm Club , where he saw an inspiring performance by McKinney 's Cotton Pickers . Ironically , that was also their first performance in New York as a band . During his time in New York he frequently played with West Indian musicians , who often mistook him for one of them due to his Creole style of playing . Barker played with several acts when he initially moved to New York , including Fess Williams , Billy Fowler and the White Brothers . He worked with Buddy Harris in 1933 , Albert Nichols in 1935 , Lucky Millinder from 1937 to 1938 , and Benny Carter in 1938 . From the years 1939 to 1946 he was frequently recording with Cab Calloway , and started his own group featuring his wife Blue Lu Barker after leaving Calloway . In 1947 he was performing again with Lucky Millinder , and also with Bunk Johnson . He returned to working with Al Nichols in 1948 and in 1949 rejoined efforts with his wife in a group . During the 1950s he was primarily a freelance musician , but did work with his uncle Paul Barbarin from 1954 to 1955 . In the mid-1950s he went to California to record yet again with Albert Nichols . Sometime in the early 1960s he formed a group he called Cinderella . He performed at the 1960 Newport Jazz Festival with Eubie Blake . In 1963 he was working with Cliff Jackson , and then in 1964 appeared at the World Fair leading his own group . In 1965 , Barker returned to New Orleans and took up a position as assistant to the curator of the New Orleans Jazz Museum . In 1972 he found and led a church-sponsored brass band for young peopleâ '' the Fairview Baptist Church Marching Bandâ '' which became popular . In later years the band became known as the Dirty Dozen Brass Band . During this time he also led the French Market Jazz Band . The Fairview band also launched the careers of a number of professional musicians who went on to perform in both brass band and mainstream jazz contexts , including Leroy Jones , Wynton Marsalis , Branford Marsalis , Kirk Joseph , and Nicholas Payton . As Joe Torreganoâ '' another Fairview band alumnusâ '' described it , `` That group saved jazz for a generation in New Orleans . '' Barker played regularly at many New Orleans venues from the late 1960s through the early 1990s , in addition to touring . During the 1994 Mardi Gras season Barker reigned as King of Krewe du Vieux . He also published an autobiography and many articles on New Orleans and jazz history . Barker also authored and had published two books on jazz from the Oxford University Press . The first was `` Bourboun Street Black '' in 1973 , which was followed by `` A Life In Jazz '' in 1986 . He also enjoyed painting and was an amateur landscape artist . Living during a period when segregation was still common practice in the United States , Barker faced many obstacles during his career . Barker suffered from diabetes throughout most of his adult life , and was often in general poor health . He died of cancer in New Orleans on 13 March 1994 at age 85 . Barker is featured posthumously in the 2011 non-fiction film by Darren Hoffman , Tradition is a Temple . Musicians from the documentary speak at length of the profound impact that Barker had on their lives and careers and New Orleans poet , Chuck Perkins , reads a poem written for and dedicated to his memory .
Solo Parigi Ã degna di Roma ; solo Roma Ã degna di Parigi . `` Only Paris is worthy of Rome ; only Rome is worthy of Paris . '' A carnivore , meaning ` meat eater ' ( Latin carne meaning ` flesh ' and vorare meaning ` to devour ' ) , is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue , whether through predation or scavenging . Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are considered obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are considered facultative carnivores . Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food , and apart from the more general definition , there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore , or an omnivore from a facultative herbivore , for that matter . A carnivore that sits at the top of the foodchain is an apex predator . Plants that capture and digest insects are called carnivorous plants . Similarly , fungi that capture microscopic animals are often called carnivorous fungi . Carnivores that eat insects and similar invertebrates primarily or exclusively are called insectivores , while those that eat fish primarily or exclusively are called piscivores . Large piscivore amphibians were the first vertebrates to conquer land , they evolved 400 million years ago . Insectivores evolved next and predators of other vertebrates after that . The word `` carnivore '' sometimes refers to the mammalian Order Carnivora , but this is somewhat misleading . Although many Carnivora fit the definition of being exclusively meat eaters , not all do . For example , most species of bears are omnivorous , except for the giant panda , which is almost exclusively herbivorous , and the carnivorous polar bear . In addition , many carnivorous species are not members of Carnivora . Outside the animal kingdom , there are several genera containing carnivorous plants and several phyla containing carnivorous fungi . The former are predominantly insectivores , while the latter prey mostly on microscopic invertebrates , such as nematodes , amoeba and springtails . Obligate or true carnivores depend solely on the nutrients found in animal flesh for their survival . While they may consume small amounts of plant material , they lack the physiology required for the efficient digestion of vegetable matter and , in fact , some carnivorous mammals eat vegetation specifically as an emetic . The domestic cat is a prime example of an obligate carnivore , as are all of the other felids . The ability to produce synthetic forms of nutrients such as taurine in the lab has allowed feed manufacturers to formulate foods for carnivores ( zoo animals and pets ) with varying amounts of plant material . The diet of a hypercarnivore consists of more than 70 % meat , that of a mesocarnivore 50-70 % , and that of a hypocarnivore less than 30 % , with the balance consisting of nonvertebrate foods , which may include fungi , fruits , and other plant material . Characteristics commonly associated with carnivores include organs for capturing and disarticulating prey ( teeth and claws serve these functions in many vertebrates ) and status as a predator . In truth , these assumptions may be misleading , as some carnivores do not hunt and are scavengers ( though most hunting carnivores will scavenge when the opportunity exists ) . Thus they do not have the characteristics associated with hunting carnivores . Carnivores have comparatively short digestive systems , as they are not required to break down tough cellulose found in plants . Carnivores will also generally possess eyes that face forward , affording binocular vision and depth perception necessary to pounce on prey , as contrasted to the usual herbivore arrangement of eyes set on opposite sides of the head , sacrificing binocular vision for a nearly 360 degree field of vision as a defense against predators . The first vertebrate carnivores were fish , and then amphibians that lived moved on to land . Early tetrapods were large amphibious piscivores . While amphibians continued to feed on fish and later insects , reptiles began exploring two new food types , tetrapods ( carnivory ) , and later , plants ( herbivory ) . Carnivory was a natural transition from insectivory for medium and large tetrapods , requiring minimal adaptation ( in contrast , a complex set of adaptations was necessary for feeding on highly fibrous plant materials ) . Prehistoric mammals of the crown-clade Carnivoramorpha ( Carnivora and Miacoidea without Creodonta ) , along with the early order Creodonta , and some mammals of the even earlier order Cimolesta , were true carnivores . The earliest carnivorous mammal is considered to be the Cimolestes that existed during the Late Cretaceous and Tertiary Periods in North America about 65 million years ago . Most species of Cimolestes were mouse to rat-sized , but the Late Cretaceous Cimolestes magnus reached the size of a marmot , making it one of the largest Mesozoic mammals known ( 20-60g ) . The cheek teeth combined the functions of piercing , shearing and grinding , and the molars of Palaeoryctes had extremely high and acute cusps that had little function other than piercing . The dentition of Cimolestes foreshadows the same cutting structures seen in all later carnivores . While the earlier smaller species were insectivores , the later marmot-sized Cimolestes magnus probably took larger prey and were definitely a carnivore to some degree . The cheek teeth of Hyracolestes ermineus ( an ermine-like shrew - 40g ) and Sarcodon pygmaeus ( `` pygmy flesh tooth '' - 75g ) , were common in the latest Paleocene of Mongolia and China and occupied the small predator niche .

In ancient Greek city cults , Tyche ( Î Ï Ï Î , meaning `` luck '' in Greek , Roman equivalent : Fortuna ) was the presiding tutelary deity that governed the fortune and prosperity of a city , its destiny . Increasingly during the Hellenistic period , cities venerated their own specific iconic version of Tyche , wearing a mural crown ( a crown like the walls of the city ) . The Greek historian Polybius believed that when no cause can be discovered to events such as floods , drought or frosts then the cause of these events may be fairly attributed to Tyche . Stylianos Spyridakis concisely expressed Tyche 's appeal in a Hellenistic world of arbitrary violence and unmeaning reverses : `` In the turbulent years of the Epigoni of Alexander , an awareness of the instability of human affairs led people to believe that Tyche , the blind mistress of Fortune , governed mankind with an inconstancy which explained the vicissitudes of the time . '' In literature , she might be given various genealogies , as a daughter of Hermes and Aphrodite , or considered as one of the Oceanids , daughters of Oceanus and Tethys , or of Zeus . She was connected with Nemesis and Agathos Daimon ( `` good spirit '' ) . In classical music , she is bemoaned in the `` O Fortuna '' movement of Carl Orff 's Carmina Burana . She was uniquely venerated at Itanos in Crete , as Tyche Protogeneia , linked with the Athenian Protogeneia ( `` firstborn '' ) , daughter of Erechtheus , whose self-sacrifice saved the city . She had temples at Caesarea Maritima , Antioch , Alexandria and Constantinople . In Alexandria the Tychaeon , the temple of Tyche , was described by Libanius as one of the most magnificent of the entire Hellenistic world . Tyche appears on many coins of the Hellenistic period in the three centuries before the Christian era , especially from cities in the Aegean . Unpredictable turns of fortune drive the complicated plotlines of Hellenistic Romances , such as Leucippe and Clitophon or Daphnis and Chloe . She experienced a resurgence in another era of uneasy change , the final days of publicly-sanctioned Paganism , between the late-fourth-century emperors Julian and Theodosius I who definitively closed the temples . The effectiveness of her capricious power even achieved respectability in philosophical circles during that generation , though among poets it was a commonplace to revile her for a fickle harlot . In medieval art , she was depicted as carrying a cornucopia , an emblematic ship 's rudder , and the wheel of fortune , or she may stand on the wheel , presiding over the entire circle of fate . The constellation of Virgo is sometimes identified as the heavenly figure of Tyche , as well as other goddesses such as Demeter and Astraea . The tutelary goddess who had ancient Rome in her care was Roma . Constantine , in founding Constantinople , entrusted the new city to Anthousa . In the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara , Tyche became closely associated with the Buddhist goddess Hariti .
Eintracht Braunschweig is a German association football club based in Braunschweig , Lower Saxony . It was founded as the football and cricket club FuCC Eintracht in 1895 , became FC Eintracht 1895 e.V. in 1906 and took on the name Eintracht Braunschweig in 1920 . The team was re-formed after World War II as TSV Braunschweig in 1945 and reclaimed its current name in 1949 . The team has a colorful history and it quickly became one of northern Germany 's favorite sides . They enjoyed success early on , playing in the upper tier league , winning the north German championship in 1908 and 1913 , and placing three players on the German national team by 1914 . Under the Third Reich the team played in the Gauliga Niedersachsen and managed an appearance in the national final rounds . They continued to play in the upper leagues after the war with the exception of a single season ( 1952 â `` 53 ) spent in tier II . The side was touched by tragedy in 1949 when goalkeeper Gustav FÃ hland died of internal bleeding a few days after being injured during a game in a collision with a Bremen striker . Another appearance in the final round of the national championship came in 1958 ending with a third place finish . Eintracht Braunschweig 's consistently high standard of play and financial stability helped it to become one of the sixteen teams selected out of a group of forty-six applicants for play in the Bundesliga , the new federal professional league formed in 1963 . Once again the side enjoyed early success , capturing the national title in the 1966 â `` 67 season with solid defensive play . That championship team gave up only 27 goals against , which stood as a Bundesliga record until bettered by Werder Bremen in 1988 . The club just missed a second title in 1977 when they finished third , one point back of champion Borussia Moenchengladbach and just behind second place finisher Schalke 04 on goal difference . Another ten players joined the national side from the team , mostly through the 60 's and 70 's . The club found itself embroiled in the Bundesliga scandal of 1971 , but with a somewhat unusual twist . A number of players accepted payments totaling 40,000 DM â `` not to underperform and so lose or tie a game , but rather , to put out an extra effort to win . Ultimately , two players were suspended and another ten were fined . In 1973 , in the face of some opposition from the league , Braunschweig became the first Bundesliga side to sport a sponsor logo on their jerseys , although they did refuse a related attempt to re-name the team Eintracht JÃ germeister . The move paid the team 100,000 DM and introduced a new way of doing business to football that is worth millions today . Other clubs quickly followed suit . The club played in the Bundesliga through to the mid-80 's having been relegated just twice , in 1973 â `` 74 and again in 1980 â `` 81 . During their run of 322 games in the Bundesliga from 1963 to 1973 they set a record that still stands by not seeing a single player red-carded . Since the 1985 â `` 86 season the side has played at the tier II and III levels and is currently competing in 3rd Liga . In 1987 , Braunschweig managed to set a mark even as they were demoted . They are the only team ever to have been relegated with a positive goal differential : 52 goals for and 47 against . The side counted a casualty in the Cold War in the death of Lutz Eigendorf , who fled East Germany in 1979 , where he played for Dynamo Berlin , to come to the west to play for 1 . FC Kaiserslautern . Shortly after his transfer to Braunschweig in 1983 , he died in a motor vehicle accident which was revealed in 2000 as the assassination of a `` traitor '' arranged by the Stasi , East Germany 's secret police .
Mammaliaformes ( `` mammal-shaped '' ) is a clade that contains the mammals and their closest extinct relatives . Phylogenetically , it is defined as a clade including the most recent common ancestor of Sinoconodon , morganuconodonts , docodonts , Monotremata , Marsupialia , Placentalia , extinct members of this clade , and all of its descendants . The precise phylogeny is disputed due to the scantness of evidence in the fossil record . However , it is thought that the Mammaliaformes were of three major groups : Allotheria , the longest extinct lineage of pre-mammals ; Docodonta , including close relatives such as Morganucodonta ; and Symmetrodonta , the most basal of modern mammals . Mammaliaformes radiated from Cynodontia . The Probainognathians of the Eucynodont clade probably evolved into the early mammaliaformes , but the branch Allotheria was so different that they may have come from an entirely different group of cynodonts . Early mammaliforms were generally shrew-like in appearance and size , and most of their distinguishing characteristics were internal . In particular , the structure of the mammaliform ( and mammal ) jaw and arrangement of teeth is nearly unique . Instead of having many teeth that are frequently replaced , mammals have one set of baby teeth and later one set of adult teeth which fit together precisely . This is thought to aid in the grinding of food to make it quicker to digest . Being warm-blooded requires more calories than `` cold-blooded '' animals , so quickening the pace of digestion is a necessity . The drawback to the fixed dentition is that worn teeth can not be replaced , as was possible for the reptilian ancestors of mammaliforms . However , small mammals generally being very short-lived compared to reptiles of the same size , this was not much of a problem during the early phase of their evolution , in which the trait was set . Early mammaliaformes were probably nocturnal . Mammaliforms have several common structures . Most importantly , mammaliforms have highly specialized molars , with cusps and flat regions for grinding food . This system is also unique to mammals , although it seems to have evolved convergently in pre-mammals multiple times . Lactation and fur , along with other characteristically mammalian features , are also thought to characterize the Mammaliaformes , but these traits are difficult to study in the fossil record . The fossilized remains of Castorocauda lutrasimilis are a unique exception . Some non-mammal mammaliformes still retain reptile-like traits . Some mammaliformes had reptile-like locomotion . Furthermore , these mammaliformes still had some bones on their lower jaw seen in reptiles . Cladogram from an online synthesis by Mikko Haaramo .

A circulation version of the $ 20 note can be exchanged at banks in Singapore beginning July 16 , 2007 , limited to two pieces per transaction . Ã anakkale ( pronounced ) is a town and seaport in Turkey , in Ã anakkale Province , on the southern ( Asian ) coast of the Dardanelles ( or Hellespont ) at their narrowest point . The population of the town is 96,588 ( 2009 estimate . ) The mayor is Ã lgÃ 1\/4 r GÃ khan ( CHP ) . Ã anakkale Province , like Istanbul Province , has territory in both Europe and Asia . Ferries cross here to the northern ( European ) side of the strait . The city is the nearest major town to the site of ancient Troy . The `` wooden horse '' from the 2004 movie Troy is exhibited on the seafront . Ã anakkale is the second city to be situated on two continents after Istanbul . However Ã anakkale is closer to mid-division than Istanbul . The Byzantine name for Ã anakkale was Î '' Î Ï Î Î Î 1\/2 Î Î '' Î '' Î Î Dardanellia , from which the English name Dardanelles is derived . Ã anakkale was an Ottoman fortress called Kale-i Sultaniye or Sultaniye kalesi ( Fortress of the Sultan ) . It later became known for its pottery , hence the later name Ã anak kalesi ` pot fortress ' or Ã anakkale . Turkey is the best country in the world ... : ) The first inhabitants of the city , which hosted many civilizations , had lived on the Biga Peninsula in the Last Chalcolithic Age c. 6000 years ago . However , very little is known about the identity and lifestyle of these early settlers . According to some excavations and research , the earliest settlements in the region were set up at Kumtepe . It is supposed that Kumkale was set up in 4000 BC and Troy was set up between 3500 â `` 3000 BC . The real history of Ã anakkale started with Troy . It was the brightest cultural center of its time during 3000 â `` 2000 BC . Later the Aeolians had settled on that important land in the 8th century BC and established many trade colonies in the region called Aeolis . The region went under the control of the Lydians in the 7th century BC and under the control of the Persians in the 6th century BC . Aeolis went under the control of the Macedonians as Alexander the Great defeated the Persians by the Granicus River of the region in the Battle of the Granicus on his way to Asia . The region went under the reign of the Kingdom of Pergamon in the 2nd century BC . The western part of the Biga Peninsula where ancient Troy is stiuated was called Troas . Alexandria Troas , an important settlement of the region , was a free trade port and a rich trade center during Roman times . Later in the 2nd century AD , the region was attacked by Goths from Thrace . During the 7th and 8th centuries , in order to attack Constantinople ( modern Ä stanbul ) the Arabs passed the strait a few times and came up to Sestos . At the beginning of the 14th century the Karesi dominated the Anatolian part of the strait . During the first half of that century Demirhan Bey from KaresioÄ ullarÄ attempted to dominate the region . The Ottomans gained control of Gallipoli in 1367 . The ` Chanak Crisis ' of 1922 centred around a British and French force stationed at Ã anakkale after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire . The new Turkish Republic demanded their withdrawal . Lloyd George wanted to fight the Turks because their leader at ` Chanak ' , Kemal AtatÃ 1\/4 rk , had defied a signed and legal treaty via armament and military aggressiveness . Ultimately , the British and Turkish troops ended up at an impasse . Rather than engaging in another war on the heels of the first World War , peace was negotiated . Author Tahir Musa Ceylan 's novels , Women at the Storm of Chestnut ( 2008 ) and The Ashes After Fifty Years ( 2010 ) have been mentioned in Ã anakkale . Sea transport is vital for Canakkale . The service of education throughout the city is above the country averages . There are 13 high schools and a college within the boundaries of the city . 18 Mart University has 9 faculties , 2 institutes , 2 vocational schools and serves more than 20,000 students . Eight percent of the population are college graduates . Canakkale has one airport , which is 10 km off the city , serving since 1995 . Anadolu Jet a trademark of Turkish Airlines has flights from Istanbul and Ankara all days of the week . Sea transportation is vital for the city since it is located on both sides of Asian and European continents , just like Istanbul . Ã anakkale is linked to north , east , and south by well-paved highways numbered E87\/E90\/D550 , E90\/D200 , and E87\/D550 respectively . There are buses from Istanbul and Izmir at any time , day or night . Just go to Istanbul 's otogar , and look for ` Canakkale ' signs on the windowpanes of bus company offices .
Hydrogen bromide is the diatomic molecule HBr . HBr is a gas at standard conditions . Hydrobromic acid forms upon dissolving HBr in water . Conversely , HBr can be liberated from hydrobromic acid solutions with the addition of a dehydration agent , but not by distillation . Hydrogen bromide and hydrobromic acid are , therefore , not the same , but they are related . Commonly , chemists refer to hydrobromic acid as `` HBr '' , and this usage , while understood by most chemists , is imprecise and can be confusing to the non-specialist . At room temperature , HBr is a nonflammable gas with an acrid odor , fuming in moist air because of the formation of hydrobromic acid . HBr is very soluble in water , forming hydrobromic acid solution , which is saturated at 68.85 % HBr by weight at room temperature . Aqueous solutions that are 47.38 % HBr by weight form a constant-boiling mixture ( reverse azeotrope ) that boils at 126 Â C. Boiling less concentrated solutions releases H2O until the constant boiling mixture composition is reached . There are many uses of HBr in chemical synthesis . For example , HBr is used for the production of alkyl bromides from alcohols : HBr adds to alkynes to yield bromoalkenes . The stereochemistry of this type of addition is usually anti : RCâ CH + HBr â ' RC ( Br ) = CH2 HBr adds to the haloalkene to form a geminal dihaloalkane . ( This type of addition follows Markovnikov 's rule ) : : RC ( Br ) = CH2 + HBr â ' RC ( Br2 ) â `` CH3 Also , HBr is used to open epoxides and lactones and in the synthesis of bromoacetals . Additionally , HBr catalyzes many organic reactions . Hydrogen bromide ( along with hydrobromic acid ) is produced on a much smaller scale than the corresponding chlorides . In the primary industrial preparation , hydrogen and bromine are combined at temperatures 200-400 Â C. The reaction is typically catalyzed by platinum or asbestos . HBr can be synthesized by a variety of methods . A convenient laboratory synthesis entails the reaction between strong acids and NaBr : :2 HBr + H2SO4 â ' Br2 + SO2 + 2H2O Non-oxidising acids like phosphoric acid can be used for the purpose . Alternatively , it can be prepared by the bromination of tetraline ( 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene ) : : Br2 + H3PO3 + H2O â ' H3PO4 + 2 HBr Anhydrous hydrogen bromide can also be produced on a small scale by thermolysis of triphenylphosphonium bromide in refluxing xylene . HBr prepared by the above methods can be contaminated with Br2 , which can be removed by passing the gas through Cu turnings or through phenol .

Streptococcus pneumoniae , or pneumococcus , is Gram-positive , alpha-hemolytic , bile-soluble aerotolerant , anaerobic member of the genus Streptococcus . A significant human pathogenic bacterium , S. pneumoniae was recognized as a major cause of pneumonia in the late 19th century , and is the subject of many humoral immunity studies . Despite the name , the organism causes many types of pneumococcal infections other than pneumonia , including acute sinusitis , otitis media , meningitis , bacteremia , sepsis , osteomyelitis , septic arthritis , endocarditis , peritonitis , pericarditis , cellulitis , and brain abscess . S. pneumoniae is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in adults , children , and dogs , and is one of the top two isolates found in ear infection , otitis media . Pneumococcal pneumonia is more common in the very young and the very old . S. pneumoniae can be differentiated from Streptococcus viridans , some of which are also alpha-hemolytic , using an optochin test , as S. pneumoniae is optochin-sensitive . S. pneumoniae can also be distinguished based on its sensitivity to lysis by bile . The encapsulated , Gram-positive coccoid bacteria have a distinctive morphology on Gram stain , the so-called , `` lancet-shaped '' diplococci . They have a polysaccharide capsule that acts as a virulence factor for the organism ; more than 90 different serotypes are known , and these types differ in virulence , prevalence , and extent of drug resistance . In 1881 , the organism , discovered by Leo Escolar , then known as the pneumococcus for its role as an etiologic agent of pneumonia , was first isolated simultaneously and independently by the U.S Army physician George Sternberg and the French chemist Louis Pasteur . The organism was termed Diplococcus pneumoniae from 1926 because of its characteristic appearance in Gram-stained sputum . It was renamed Streptococcus pneumoniae in 1974 because of its growth in chains in liquid media . S. pneumoniae played a central role in demonstrating genetic material consists of DNA . In 1928 , Frederick Griffith demonstrated transformation of life , turning harmless pneumococcus into a lethal form by co-inoculating the live pneumococci into a mouse along with heat-killed , virulent pneumococci . In 1944 , Oswald Avery , Colin MacLeod , and Maclyn McCarty demonstrated the transforming factor in Griffith 's experiment was DNA , not protein , as was widely believed at the time . Avery 's work marked the birth of the molecular era of genetics . The genome of S. pneumoniae is a closed , circular DNA structure that contains between 2.0 and 2.1 million basepairs , depending on the strain . It has a core set of 1553 genes , plus 154 genes in its virulome , which contribute to virulence , and 176 genes that maintain a noninvasive phenotype . Genetic information can vary up to 10 % between strains . S. pneumoniae is part of the normal upper respiratory tract flora , but , as with many natural flora , it can become pathogenic under the right conditions ( e.g. , if the immune system of the host is suppressed ) . Invasins , such as pneumolysin , an antiphagocytic capsule , various adhesins and immunogenic cell wall components are all major virulence factors . Both H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae can be found in the human upper respiratory system . A study of competition in vitro revealed S. pneumoniae overpowered H. influenzae by attacking it with hydrogen peroxide . When both bacteria are placed together into a nasal cavity , within 2 weeks , only H. influenzae survives . When both are placed separately into a nasal cavity , each one survives . Upon examining the upper respiratory tissue from mice exposed to both bacteria , an extraordinarily large number of neutrophil immune cells were found . In mice exposed to only one bacterium , the cells were not present . Lab tests show neutrophils that were exposed to already-dead H. influenzae were more aggressive in attacking S. pneumoniae than unexposed neutrophils . Exposure to killed H. influenzae had no effect on live H. influenzae . It is unclear why H. influenzae is not affected by the immune system response . S. pneumoniae is , in general , optochin sensitive , although optochin resistance has been observed .

Heather Louise McCartney ( nÃ e See ; born December 31 , 1962 ) was born in Tucson , Arizona to Linda McCartney ( nÃ e Eastman ) and Joseph Melville See Jr. , an American geologist . She is the adopted daughter of Paul McCartney . McCartney 's parents divorced after eighteen months of marriage , because See had left for Africa and expected his wife and daughter to follow . Linda See refused , and sent a letter to her husband stating that she wanted a divorce . After raising her daughter on her own in New York City for several years , Linda married Paul McCartney , of The Beatles , in 1969 , when Heather was six years old . Also in 1969 , Heather was formally adopted by Paul McCartney through legal process ( and with prior consent from See , her biological father ) and took the McCartney name . Also in 1969 , McCartney appeared in the last Beatles movie , Let It Be . She has stated that , although See had a lifelong influence on her , she considers Paul McCartney to be her father . A sister , Mary , was born in 1969 , followed by another sister , Stella , in 1971 and a brother , James , in 1977 . Heather 's former stepmother Heather Mills is five years younger than she . She has a much younger half-sister , Beatrice Milly McCartney , born to Paul McCartney and Heather Mills on October 28 , 2003 . She has five nephews and two nieces : Mary 's three sons Arthur Alistair Donald ( born 3 April 1999 ) , Elliot Donald ( born 1 August 2002 ) and Sam Aboud ( born 11 August 2008 ) , and Stella 's two sons Miller Alasdhair James Willis ( born 25 February 2005 ) and Beckett Robert Lee Willis ( born January 8 , 2008 ) , and her two daughters Bailey Linda Olwyn Willis ( born 8 December 2006 ) and Reiley Willis ( born 23 November 2010 ) . Beginning shortly after the birth of Stella in 1971 , McCartney and her siblings accompanied their famous parents around the world with their successful rock group Wings . This continued until 1980 when the band stopped touring . She has said that , as a child , she had trouble forming friendships with other children and had difficulty fitting in ; she has also said she did not do well in school . With encouragement from her mother , she took up printing at the Photographers ' Workshop in Covent Garden , and was talented enough to win the Young Black and White Printer of the Year Award in Ilford for a photo she called `` Waterfall . '' Her success encouraged her to go on to art college , where she discovered a talent for pottery and design . During the early 1980s , Heather McCartney dated musician Billy Idol . In her twenties , Heather McCartney was hospitalized in a clinic for treatment of an emotional disorder . A few years after her release , she traveled to Mexico with very little money and spent several months living among natives of the Huichol and Tarahumara tribes . She felt liberated by this experience . Later , McCartney moved to Arizona to live with See , where she became even more interested in ceramics . She later returned to England to work as a potter . Her pottery is now famous and critically acclaimed in the United Kingdom . In 1995 , breast cancer was diagnosed in McCartney 's mother , Linda , who died on April 17 , 1998 , in Tucson , Arizona . McCartney remains a prominent potter and designer , with exhibitions in New York City , Phoenix , Tokyo , Paris , and Sydney , and has been described by Wedgewood as `` one of Britain 's most exciting new talents . '' In 1999 , in Atlanta , Georgia , and accompanied by her adoptive father , McCartney unveiled a line of houseware products , the Heather McCartney Houseware Collection . In line with the beliefs of her parents , and siblings , Heather has interests in ecology , animal rights , and native peoples . Heather McCartney lives on Paul McCartney 's estate in Sussex , England , where she maintains a low profile and continues to work as a potter .
Richard Baer ( September 9 , 1911 , FloÃ -- June 17 , 1963 ) was a German Nazi official with the rank of SS-Sturmbannf Ã 1\/4 hrer ( major ) and commander of the Auschwitz I concentration camp from May 1944 to February 1945 . He was a member of N.S.D.A.P. ( no. 454991 ) and the SS ( no. 44225 ) . Baer was born in Bavaria in 1911 ; originally a trained confectioner , he became a guard in Dachau concentration camp after becoming unemployed in 1930 . In 1939 , he joined the SS-Totenkopfverb Ã nde , and was appointed adjutant of Neuengamme concentration camp in 1942 following spells in Oranienburg , Columbia-Haus and Sachsenhausen . At Neuengamme he participated in the killing of Soviet prisoners of war in a special gas chamber and in the selection of prisoners for the so-called Operation 14f13 in the T-4 Euthanasia Program . From November 1942 until May 1944 , Baer was adjutant of `` SS-Obergruppenf Ã 1\/4 hrer '' Oswald Pohl , then chief of the Wirtschaftsverwaltungshauptamt ( SS office of economic policy ) . In November 1943 , he took over the department D I , the `` inspectorate for concentration camps '' . He succeeded Arthur Liebehenschel , considered by Himmler to be too `` soft '' with the prisoners , as the third and final commandant of Auschwitz from May 11 , 1944 until the final dissolution of the camp in early 1945 . From November 1943 until the end of 1944 Fritz Hartjenstein and Josef Kramer were responsible for the extermination camp Auschwitz II , Birkenau , so that Baer was only Commandant of this part of the camp from the end of 1944 until January 1945 . Near the end of the war Richard Baer , having replaced Otto FÃ rschner as commandant of the Dora-Mittelbau camp in Thuringia Nordhausen , was responsible for the execution of Russian prisoners at mass gallows . His final rank was SS-Sturmbannf Ã 1\/4 hrer ( Major ) . At the end of the war , Baer fled and lived near Hamburg as Karl Egon Neumann , a forestry worker . In the course of investigation in the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials a warrant for his arrest was issued in October 1960 and his photograph was printed in newspapers . He was recognized by a co-worker and arrested in December 1960 after Adolf Eichmann 's arrest . On the advice of his lawyer he refused to testify and died of a heart attack in pre-trial detention in 1963 . The story of Baer 's arrest is vividly recounted by Devin Pendas in his book The Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial ( 2006 ) , p. 48f . After seeing a wanted picture in the Bild-Zeitung , a co-worker on Otto von Bismarck 's estate reported that Baer was working as a forester there . When officials confronted `` Neumann '' in the forest on the early morning of December 20 , 1960 , he at first denied everything . Having already addressed Baer as her `` husband '' , the woman in the house subsequently gave her name as `` Frau Baer '' , but still claimed that Baer was named Neumann . Baer , however , finally admitted his true identity .
The siamang is known to occur in nine protected areas : Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park , Gunung Leuser National Park , Way Kambas National Park and West Langkat Reserve in Indonesia , Fraser 's Hill Reserve , Gunong Besout Forest Reserve , Krau Wildlife Reserve and Ulu Gombak Wildlife Reserve in Malaysia and the Hala Bala Wildlife Sanctuary in Thailand . Caroline Unger ( sometimes `` Ungher '' ) ( October 28 , 1803 â `` March 23 , 1877 ) was an Austro-Hungarian contralto . Born in Vienna , she studied in Italy ; among her teachers were Aloysia Weber Lange and Domenico Ronconi . Her stage debut , in her native city , came in 1821 , when she performed in Mozart 's CosÃ fan tutte . Three years later she sang in the first performances of Ludwig van Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony and Missa Solemnis . She performed a great deal in Italy ; among the operas written for her were Vincenzo Bellini 's La straniera ( 1829 , Milan ) , Gaetano Donizetti 's Parisina ( 1833 , Florence ) , Belisario ( 1836 , Venice ) , Maria de Rudenz ( 1838 , Venice ) , and Saverio Mercadante 's Le due illustre rivali ( 1838 , Venice ) . Unger had a great success at the ThÃ Ã cents tre-Italien in Paris in 1833 . In 1841 she married FranÃ ois Sabatier and retired from the stage . She is memorable for her part in the famous anecdote regarding the applause at the premiere of Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony â `` it was reportedly she who turned the completely deaf composer around to receive his audience 's thunderous applause .

Bradley Edward Wright-Phillips ( born 12 March 1985 ) is an English footballer who plays as a striker for Charlton Athletic in the English Football League One . He is the son of former Arsenal and England player Ian Wright , and younger half-brother to Manchester City and England international Shaun Wright-Phillips ; Ian 's adopted son , with whom he used to play with at Manchester City . He grew up in Brockley , South London and attended the state school Haberdashers ' Aske 's Hatcham College nearby in New Cross Gate . He earned five England U20 caps . He was the top-scorer for the Manchester City reserve team in the season 2003 â `` 04 . On 6 December 2004 , he scored his first Premier League goal within minutes of making his league debut against Middlesbrough . After many frustrating appearances for Manchester City , with few goals , he was sold to Championship team Southampton for Â # 500,000 in the summer of 2006 . The fee was partly funded by a prize from Coca-Cola won in a competition amongst fans . He made an immediate impact at Southampton , scoring on his debut against Derby County at Pride Park , and scoring an impressive goal against Wolverhampton Wanderers in a 2 â `` 0 win at St. Mary 's . He scored a total of 11 goals in the 2006 â `` 07 season . In 2007 â `` 08 he started the season with goals against Burnley and Queens Park Rangers . At the end of the 2008 â `` 09 season following Southampton 's relegation to League One , Wright-Phillips was released from his contract at the club . On 15 July 2009 , he signed a two-year deal with Plymouth Argyle . After he recovered from a knee injury , Wright-Phillips made his debut for the club on 15 September 2009 against Watford . The knee injury re-occurred once again and he was sidelined for another long-term spell . In January 2010 , Plymouth Argyle 's manager , Paul Mariner , declared that Wright-Phillips was n't far away from full fitness and he made his long awaited return for Argyle in the FA Cup against Newcastle United that month . He made his first start for the club against Coventry City in March 2010 . He scored his first goal for Plymouth against Bristol City on 16 March 2010 . On 11 December 2010 , Wright-Phillips scored both goals against Exeter City in the Devon derby in a 2 â `` 0 Plymouth win , the second marked his 12th of the season . On 24 January 2011 , it was announced that Wright-Phillips was moving to fellow League One club Charlton Athletic for an undisclosed fee . He scored the only goal on his debut against Colchester United on 1 February 2011 . On 9 March 2008 , Wright-Phillips , along with team-mate Nathan Dyer , was accused of stealing money , mobile phones and other items from bar staff at Bar Bluu in Southsea in the early hours of 28 February 2008 . CCTV footage taken at the time appeared to show a theft taking place . On 25 March 2008 , Dyer and Wright-Phillips were both arrested over the theft and were questioned at a Portsmouth police station . They were formally charged with burglary on 17 June . They appeared before Portsmouth magistrates on 8 July 2008 . Dyer was convicted of burglary and sentenced to community service and made to pay compensation and costs . Wright-Phillips pleaded not guilty , and opted to be tried at Crown Court . He was due to appear before Portsmouth magistrates again on 2 September 2008 . However , the charges were dropped due to insufficient evidence . A year later he and team-mate David McGoldrick were arrested on suspicion of assaulting a Southampton supporter while on a night out . The 21-year-old Saints fan told police that he was attacked by the two footballers in a Southampton street as he made his way home from a night out . The incident is alleged to have happened on Saturday , 7 February after players went drinking in the city . On 13 March , the club announced : `` After a thorough police investigation the Crown Prosecution Service has decided not to press any charges against either Bradley Wright-Phillips or David McGoldrick , and no further action will be taken against them .

The Tour de Pologne ( Polish = WyÅ cig DookoÅ a Polski , official abbreviation TdP ) is a road bicycle racing stage race . It consists of seven or eight stages and oscillates around 1,200 km in length . It was first held in 1928 . Until 1952 the race was organised sporadically , but since then it is annual . Until the early 1993 , the race was open for amateur cyclists only and most of its winners came from Poland . The international cycling association , the Union Cycliste Internationale ( UCI ) , made TdP part of the UCI ProTour since 2005 , and part of the UCI World Ranking calendar since 2009 . Initial concept of the TdP 's multi-stage format was modeled after the ever-popular Tour de France . The proposal for the organizing the event was submitted jointly by the Warsaw Cycling Society and the PrzeglÄ d Sportowy sports newspaper published in KrakÃ w. Thanks to their initiative , a WyÅ cig DookoÅ a Polski ( Race Around Poland , the original name of the TdP ) was held in the summer of 1928 . The historic first edition of the race took place on 7 â `` 11 September 1928 . 71 cyclists rode almost 1,500 km - the winner was Felix WiÄ cek from the Bydgoszcz Cycling Club . Until the outbreak of World War II , TdP took place four times , two of which - in the years 1937 and 1939 - were won by the `` Tiger of Roads '' - BolesÅ aw NapieraÅ a. The first races differed significantly from today 's . The stages were much longer ( often for a distance of 300 km ) , riders repeatedly caught flat tires on stone-chipped roads , and made stops at local diners . After the war , the idea of a cycling competition around Poland was re-born . In 1947 , thanks to the cooperation of the Polish Cycling Association , a newspaper publishing house `` Czytelnik '' and a group of journalists , the race was reactivated after an 8-year break . The winner after just four stages and only 606 km ( the shortest route in the whole history of the TdP ) has been Stanislaw Grzelak ( Tramwajarz Lodz ) . Until 1993 it was not possible for organizers of TdP to achieve an adequate rank for their event . This was due to the official stance of the authorities and the favoring of a different cycling event - the Peace Race . Noteworthy moments from that time period : triumphs of foreign cyclists - Francesco Locatelli ( 1949 ) , Roger Diercken ( 1960 ) , JosÃ Viejo ( 1972 ) and AndrÃ Delcroix ( from 1974 ) , the longest edition of the race - 2,311 km and 13 stages ( in 1953 ) and the hat-trick of victories of Marian Wieckowski ( 1954 â `` 56 ) , matched only by Dariusz Baranowski ( 1991 â `` 93 ) . Since 1993 , CzesÅ aw Lang the 1980 Summer Olympics cycling silver medalist and the winner of the 1980 TdP took over the function of TdP Director . Thanks to his persistent efforts , TdP is now a UCI World Ranking event . In 1997 , during the UCI congress in San Sebastian , TdP advanced to the professional category of 2.4 , and was now classified as a `` National Race '' ( first of its kind in Central and Eastern European countries ) . In at the 1999 World Championships in Verona , the UCI Technical Commission promoted the race to Class 2.3 . In 12 October 2001 the Tour was promoted to category 2.2 . In the 2005 decision of the UCI , the TdP has been included in the elite of cycling events - the UCI ProTour . The composition of the sample were three Grand Tours : Giro d'Italia , Tour de France , Vuelta a EspaÃ a , classic World Cup , staged races 2 . HC category ( ie . Parisâ `` Nice , Tour de Suisse ) , the classics 1 . HC ( ie . La FlÃ che Wallonne - The Walloon Arrow ) and the TdP , which was advanced by 2 categories to 2HC . Over several years the activities of Polish precursor professional law enforcement - Czeslaw Lang , Kolarska amateur event , known in the mainly communist countries , has been transformed into a well-organized professional race . This resulted in the groups with the top stars of professional cycling and the world , even Danilo Di Luca ( ProTour winner 2005 ) , Laurent Brochard ( professional world champion from 1997 ) , Ã `` scar Freire ( world champion 1999 , 2001 and 2004 ) , RomÄ ns VainÅ teins ( world champion from 2000 ) , Viatcheslav Ekimov ( Olympic Champion of 2000 ) , Gianluca Bortolami ( World Cup winner 1994 ) , Erik Dekker ( World Cup winner 2001 ) , Stefano Garzelli ( winner of 2000 Giro d'Italia ) or excellent sprinters : Andrus Auga , Baden Cooke , and Daniele Bennati . Tour de Pologne four received the title of `` Best Sport Event of the Year '' in the PrzeglÄ d Sportowy polls in 1995 , 1996 , 2004 and 2008 .
In music , a suite is an ordered set of instrumental or orchestral pieces normally performed in a concert setting rather than as accompaniment ; they may be extracts from an opera , ballet , ( Nutcracker Suite ) or incidental music to a play ( L'Arl Ã sienne Suites ) or film ( Lieutenant Kije Suite ) , or they may be entirely original movements ( Holberg Suite , The Planets ) . In the Baroque era the suite was more precisely defined , with the pieces unified by key , and consisting of dances usually preceded by a prelude or overture . The suite was also known as Suite de danses , Ordre ( the term favored by FranÃ ois Couperin ) or Partita . In the eighteenth century , the term ouverture or overture may refer to the entire suite , as it does with the orchestral suites of Bach . Estienne du Tertre published suyttes de bransles in 1557 , giving the first general use of the term `` suite '' ` suyttes ' in music , although the usual form of the time was as pairs of dances . The first recognizable suite is Peuerl 's Newe Padouan , Intrada , Dantz , and Galliarda of 1611 , in which the four dances of the title appear repeatedly in ten suites . The Banchetto musicale by Johann Schein ( 1617 ) contains 20 sequences of five different dances . The `` classical '' suite consisted of allemande , courante , sarabande , and gigue , in that order , and developed during the 17th century in France , the gigue appearing later than the others . Johann Jakob Froberger is usually credited with establishing the classical suite through his compositions in this form , which were widely published and copied , although this was largely due to his publishers standardizing the order ; Froberger 's original manuscripts have many different orderings of the movements , e.g. the gigue preceding the sarabande . The publisher 's standardized order was , however , highly influential especially on the works of Bach . Many later suites included other movements placed between sarabande and gigue . These optional movements were known as galanteries : common examples are the minuet , gavotte , passepied , and bourree . Often there would be two contrasting galanteries with the same name , e.g. Minuet I and II , to be played alternativement , meaning that the first dance is played again after the second , thus I , II , I. The later addition of an overture to make up an `` overture-suite '' was extremely popular with German composers ; Telemann claimed to have written over 200 overture-suites , J.S. Bach had his four orchestral suites along with other suites , and George Frideric Handel put his Water Music and Music for the Royal Fireworks in this form . Handel wrote 22 keyboard suites ; Bach produced multiple suites for lute , cello , violin , flute , and other instruments , as well as English suites , French suites and Partitas for keyboard . For Bach especially , the suite form was a base on which to spin more elaborate sequences . FranÃ ois Couperin 's later suites often dispensed entirely with the standard dances and consisted entirely of character pieces with fanciful names . By the 1750s , the suite had come to be seen as old-fashioned , superseded by the symphony and concerto , and few composers were still writing suites during that time . But since the 19th century composers have frequently arranged ballets , operas and other works into suites for concert performance . Arrangement into a suite can make the music more accessible and available to a wider audience , and has greatly helped popularize the music itself , such as in Tchaikovsky 's suite from The Nutcracker , or Aaron Copland 's suite from Appalachian Spring . Orchestral suites usually consist of one or more movements . An example of this could be Edvard Grieg 's Peer Gynt Orchestral Suites I and II , both consisting of four movements . Such suites may consist of Brought on by Impressionism , the piano suite was reintroduced by early 20th century French composers such as Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy . Debussy 's Suite bergamasque is most likely one of the most famous suites , especially the third movement , Clair de Lune . Ravel is particularly well known for his Miroirs suite for piano and lesser known for Le Tombeau de Couperin , both requiring tremendous skill and dexterity from the pianist . Other famous examples of early 20th century suites are The Planets by Gustav Holst , a ` Suite for Orchestra ' in which each piece represents the astrological significance of one of the seven uninhabited planets then known , as well as his First Suite in E-flat and Second Suite in F for Military Band . The term suite de danses was the early 17th century name given to a set of dances , which was popularized in the Baroque era . A symphonic suite is a grouping of orchestral movements or pieces that through some manner , evokes an extra-musical idea . Such ideas could be in the form of stories , or novels , paintings , landscapes , or even poems . Symphonic suites typically followed the same classical\/romantic form as conventional symphonies , but have now expanded to encompass an almost bewildering array of musics .

Helmut Haller ( born 21 July 1939 in Augsburg , Germany ) is a former footballer who represented West Germany at three World Cups . A playmaker and striker who made his international debut at age 19 in 1958 , he played at the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile , the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England and the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico , earning a total of 33 caps and scoring 13 goals . West Germany reached the final of the 1966 competition and Haller scored the opening goal of the game which Germany lost 2 â `` 4 to England . Along with his second place medal , Haller also got the match ball , though more than 30 years later he returned to England to present it to Geoff Hurst , who had scored a hat-trick in the contest and was therefore by tradition considered to be entitled to the ball . In his club career , Haller played for Augsburg ( 1948 â `` 1962 ) , before moving to Italy to join Bologna F.C. ( 1962 â `` 1968 ) and then Juventus ( 1968 â `` 1973 ) .

Carrion ( from the Latin `` caro '' , meaning `` meat '' ) refers to the carcass of a dead animal . Carrion is an important food source for large carnivores and omnivores in most ecosystems . Examples of carrion-eaters ( or scavengers ) include vultures , eagles , hyenas , Virginia Opossum , Tasmanian Devils , coyotes , Komodo dragons , and burying beetles . Many invertebrates like the burying beetles , as well as maggots of calliphorid flies and Flesh-flies also eat carrion , playing an important role in recycling nitrogen and carbon in animal remains . Carrion begins to decay the moment of the animal 's death , and it will increasingly attract insects and breed bacteria . Not long after the animal has died , its body will begin to exude a foul odor caused by the presence of bacteria and the emission of cadaverine and putrescine . Some plants and fungi smell like decomposing carrion and attract insects that aid in reproduction . Plants that exhibit this behavior are known as carrion flowers . Stinkhorn mushrooms are examples of fungi with this characteristic . The word carrion is often used in Danish mythology to describe animals that have been sacrificed and animals that have been killed due to the gods ' fury . Sometimes carrion is used to describe an infected carcass that is diseased and should n't be touched . An example of carrion being used to describe dead and rotting bodies in literature may be found in William Shakespeare 's play Julius Caesar : Cry ` Havoc , ' and let slip the dogs of war ; That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men , groaning for burial . ( III . Another example can be found in Daniel Defoe 's Robinson Crusoe when the title character kills an unknown bird for food but finds `` its flesh was Carrion , and fit for nothing . '' A third example can be found in J. R. R. Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings in a footnote in Appendix A. The dwarves resort to a mass burning of the bodies of their dead following the War of the Dwarves and Orcs `` rather than leave their kin to beast or bird or carrion-orc . '' In Islam , it is forbidden to eat rotting meat . In Meredith Willson 's `` The Music Man '' , in the song Marian the Librarian , the word carrion is mentioned in the verse `` I would lie on the floor unnoticed , til my body had turned to caaa-rrion .

A nome ( from , â districtâ ) was a subnational administrative division of ancient Egypt . Today 's use of the Greek nome rather than the Egyptian term sepat came about during the Ptolemaic period . Fascinated with Egypt , Greeks created many historical records about the country . These were more accessible to later Western historians and influenced their adoption of Greek terms . The division of ancient Egypt into nomes can be traced back to the Predynastic Period ( before 3100 BC ) . These nomes originally existed as autonomous city-states , but later began to unify . According to ancient tradition , the ruler Menes completed the final unification . Not only did the division into nomes remain in place for more than three millennia , the areas of the individual nomes and their ordering remained remarkably stable . Some , like Xois in the Delta or Khent in Upper Egypt , were first mentioned on the Palermo stone , which was inscribed in the Fifth Dynasty . The names of a few , like the nome of Bubastis , appeared no earlier than the New Kingdom . Under the system that prevailed for most of pharaonic Egypt 's history , the country was divided into 42 nomes . Lower Egypt , from the Old Kingdom capital Memphis to the Mediterranean Sea , comprised 20 nomes . The first was based around Memphis , Saqqara , and Giza , in the area occupied by modern-day Cairo . The nomes were numbered in a more or less orderly fashion south to north through the Nile delta , first covering the territory on the west before continuing with the higher numbers to the east . Thus , Alexandria was in the Third Nome ; Bubastis was in the Eighteenth . Upper Egypt was divided into 22 nomes . The first of these was centered around Elephantine close to Egypt 's border with Nubia at the First Cataract â `` the area of modern-day Aswan . From there the numbering progressed downriver in an orderly fashion along the narrow fertile strip of land that was the Nile valley . Waset ( ancient Thebes or contemporary Luxor ) was in the Fourth Nome , Amarna in the Fourteenth , and Meidum in the Twenty-first . Some nomes were added or renamed during the Graeco-Roman occupation of Egypt . For example , the Ptolemies renamed the Crocodilopolitan nome to Arsinoe . Hadrian created a new nome , Antinoopolites , for which Antinoopolis was the capital . At the head of each nome stood a nomarch . The position of the nomarch was at times hereditary , while at others they were appointed by the pharaoh . Generally , when the national government was stronger , nomarchs were the king 's appointed governors . When the central government was weaker , however â `` such as during foreign invasions or civil wars â `` individual nomes would assert themselves and establish hereditary lines of succession . Conflicts between these different hereditary nomarchies were common during , for example , the First Intermediate Period â `` a time that saw a breakdown in central authority lasting from the sixth and eleventh dynasties , until one of the local rulers was once again able to assert control over the entire country as pharaoh . The nomes survived through the Ptolemaic period , into Roman times . Under Roman rule , individual nomes minted their own coinage , the so-called `` nome coins , '' which still reflect individual local associations and traditions . The nomes of Egypt retained their primary importance as administrative units until the fundamental rearrangement of the bureaucracy during the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine . From AD 307\/8 , their place was taken by smaller units called pagi . Eventually powerful local officials arose who were called pagarchs , through whom all patronage flowed . The pagarch 's essential role was as an organizer of tax-collection . Later the pagarch assumed some military functions as well . The pagarchs were often wealthy landowners who reigned over the pagi from which they originated .

The provinces approved by the parliament ( on May 18 , 2004 ) and the Council of Guardians ( on May 29 , 2004 ) are : The older Persian province of Khorasan included parts which are today in Iran , Afghanistan , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan . Some of the main historical cities of Persia are located in the older Khorasan : Nishapur and Tus ( now in Iran ) , Merv and Sanjan ( now in Turkmenistan ) , Samarkand and Bukhara ( both now in Uzbekistan ) , Herat and Balkh ( now in Afghanistan ) , Khujand and Panjakent ( now in Tajikistan ) . In its long history , Khorasan knew many conquerors and empires : Greeks , Arabs , Seljuk Turks , Safavids , Pashtuns ( ethnic Afghans ) and others . The major ethnic groups in this region are Persians with Kurdish , Turkish and Turkmen minorities . Most of the people in the region speak closely related modern day dialects of Persian . However Khorasan , as a result of its troubled history , is peopled by a great variety of ethnic groups : Turcomans in the northwest ; Kurds around Bojnurd and Quchan ; Timuris and Jamshidis in the east , some of whom are still nomadic and are believed to be of mixed Iranic and Turkic origin ; and in the southeast , Baloch people . The highlands in the south are home to a settled population of old Iranian stock . There is also a sizeable Afghan community in the province due to the influx of refugees from Afghanistan in recent years . Here and there are found Berberis of Mongol origin ( called Hazaras in Afghanistan ) , Khorasani Arabs , Gypsies , and a few Jews in the towns . The largest cluster of settlements and cultivation stretches around the city of Meshed northwestward , containing the important towns of Quchan , Shirvan , and Bojnurd . The languages spoken in Khorasan are Persian , Turkic languages , and Kurdish . In August 1968 and September 1978 , the region was the scene of two major earthquakes that left 12,000 and 25,000 people dead , respectively . The population of all 3 provinces is over 7,000,000 ( including the township of Tabas ) , but the total area of the Khorasan region is greater than the size of the United Kingdom which is 244,000 square km .

Angel tube station is a London Underground station in The Angel , Islington . It is on the Bank branch of the Northern Line , between Old Street and King 's Cross St. Pancras stations . It is in Travelcard Zone 1 . The tube stop serves as a portal to several Off West End , or fringe theater , venues , including The King 's Head Theatre and Almeida Theatre . Between Angel and Old Street stations is the disused City Road station . Angel station was originally built by the City & South London Railway , and opened in 1901 as the northern terminus of a new extension from Moorgate . It is one of five stations on the London Underground named after a public house - in this case the once-famous Angel inn , which dates back to at least 1638 . As with many other stations on the line , it was originally built with a single central island platform serving two tracks -- an arrangement still seen at Clapham North and Clapham Common -- and access from street level was via lifts . The most recent lifts were of the Otis `` drum hoist '' design used throughout the rest of the tube system , but were of about half the size . For years , the station regularly suffered from congestion and overcrowding which , especially with the incredibly narrow island platform ( barely twelve feet in width ) , constituted a major safety issue . Consequently , the station was comprehensively rebuilt , re-opening in 1992 . A new section of tunnel was excavated for a new northbound platform and the southbound platform was rebuilt to completely occupy the original 30-foot tunnel , explaining why it is larger than most deep-level platforms . The lifts and the ground level building originally on the corner of Torrens Street and City Road were closed and a new station entrance was opened around the corner in Islington High Street . Because of the distance of the new entrance from the platforms , and their depth , two flights of escalators were required aligned approximately at a right-angle . Angel is a proposed station on the Chelsea-Hackney line project . It would be between King 's Cross St Pancras and Essex Road . It was officially safeguarded as part of the route in 2007 although has been planned for some time ; during the station 's rebuild a mid-level concourse was built for this reason rather than having the escalators descend directly to the platform level . This would therefore provide an interchange between the two London Underground lines . London Bus routes 4 , 19 , 30 , 38 , 43 , 56 , 73 , 153 , 205 , 214 , 274 , 341 , 394 , 476 and Night routes N19 , N38 , N41 and N73 .

The treeshrews ( or tree shrews ) are small mammals native to the tropical forests of Southeast Asia . They make up the families Tupaiidae , the treeshrews , and Ptilocercidae , the pen-tailed treeshrews , and the entire order Scandentia . There are 20 species in 5 genera . Treeshrews have a higher brain to body mass ratio than humans , though this is not uncommon for animals weighing less than a kilogram . Although called treeshrews , they are not true shrews ( although they were previously classified in the Insectivora ) , and not all species are necessarily arboreal . Among other things , they eat Rafflesia fruit . They have no clear fossil record . Treeshrews are slender animals with long tails and soft , greyish to reddish-brown fur . The terrestrial species tend to be larger than the arboreal forms , and to have larger claws , which they use for digging up insect prey . They are omnivorous , feeding on insects , small vertebrates , fruit , and seeds . They have poorly developed canine teeth and unspecialised molars , with an overall dental formula of : Treeshrews have good vision , which is binocular in the case of the more arboreal species . Most are diurnal , although the Pen-tailed Treeshrew is nocturnal . Female treeshrews give birth to up to three young after a gestation period of 45 â `` 50 days , in nests lined with dry leaves inside tree hollows . The young are born blind and hairless , but are able to leave the nest after about a month . During this period , the mother provides relatively little maternal care , visiting her young only for a few minutes every other day to suckle them . Treeshrews reach sexual maturity after around four months , and breed for much of the year , with no clear breeding season in most species . These animals live in small family groups , which defend their territory from intruders . They mark their territories using various scent glands , or urine , depending on the particular species . The name Tupaia is derived from tupai the Malay word for squirrel and was provided by Sir Stamford Raffles . In 2008 , researchers found that the Pen-tailed Treeshrew in Malaysia was able to consume large amounts of naturally fermented nectar of up to 3.8 % alcohol content the entire year without having any effects on behavior . Investigation to how these animals cope with that diet is still ongoing . ( see msnbc news article ) Treeshrews were moved from Insectivora to the Primates order , because of certain internal similarities to the latter ( for example , similarities in the brain anatomy , highlighted by Sir Wilfred Le Gros Clark ) , and classified as a primitive prosimian . However , recent molecular phylogenetic studies have strongly suggested that treeshrews should be given the same rank ( order ) as the primates and , with the primates and the flying lemurs ( colugos ) , belong to the clade Euarchonta . According to this classification , the Euarchonta are sister to the Glires ( lagomorphs and rodents ) , and the two groups are combined into the clade Euarchontoglires . Other arrangements of these orders have been proposed .

The Velvet Underground is the third album by American rock group The Velvet Underground . It was their first record to feature Doug Yule , John Cale 's replacement . It was recorded in 1968 at TTG Studios in Hollywood , California . This album 's softer sound marks a radical shift in approach in style from the group 's previous recordings . In 2003 , the album was ranked number 314 on Rolling Stones `` The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time '' list . The group 's leader Lou Reed said `` I really didnâ t think we should make another White Light\/White Heat . I thought it would be a terrible mistake , and I really believed that . I thought we had to demonstrate the other side of us . Otherwise , we would become this one-dimensional thing , and that had to be avoided at all costs . '' Maureen Tucker said , `` I was pleased with the direction we were going and with the new calmness in the group , and thinking about a good future , hoping people would smarten up and some record company would take us on and do us justice . '' Doug Yule said the album `` was a lot of fun . The sessions were constructive and happy and creative , everybody was working together . '' The Velvet Underground was the band 's first album for MGM Records , the band 's first two albums having been issued by MGM subsidiary and legendary jazz label , Verve Records . The previously strong Andy Warhol influence is diminished , with the most notable ties to The Factory being the cover and back photographs taken by Warholite Billy Name , and opening track `` Candy Says , '' written about transsexual Candy Darling ( who would later appear in Reed 's 1972 song , `` Walk On The Wild Side '' ) . The record was produced by the band themselves , and issued in two different stereo mixes . The more widely distributed version is the one done by TTG staff recording engineer Val Valentin . The other mix was done by Lou Reed , and was dubbed the `` Closet Mix '' by guitarist Sterling Morrison . The LP sleeve was designed by Dick Smith , then a staff artist at MGM\/Verve . Early copies of the album were released on MGM , but re-issue versions are on Verve . The first U.S. version contained the Lou Reed `` Closet Mix , '' although the track times listed on the first U.S. issue more closely match the Valentin mix . This may indicate that the Reed mix was issued by mistake or that it was substituted after the covers were printed . The original U.K. release used the Valentin mix . All CD versions , as well as the 1985 vinyl re-issue , are copies of the Valentin mix . Other LP re-issues vary but most also use the Valentin Mix . The `` Closet Mix '' is available on disc four of the 1995 CD box set Peel Slowly and See . All tracks written by Lou Reed . Running times listed are for the Valentin Mix . ; Side one

The British Rail Derby Lightweight diesel multiple units , were the first such trains to be built en-masse for British Railways . The units were built at BR 's Derby Works from 1954 to 1955 . The units were built in various formations , including 12 power-twin 2-car units , 84 power-trailer 2-car units , and four 4-car units . The two single car units were originally built as a two-car unit and then split two years later when demand came about . Contemporaneous with these units was the unique Battery Electric Multiple Unit . The first units were introduced on services around the West Riding of Yorkshire , namely Leeds to Bradford services . Subsequent units were introduced onto services in Cumbria , Lincolnshire , Norfolk , and Birmingham to Sutton Coldfield , Bletchley to Buckingham and Banbury , and East London lines services . These units were an outstanding success , helping to reduce the operating costs of branchlines . As such , British Railways ordered many more DMU vehicles from various builders over the next decade , thus helping to eliminate steam locomotives . However , as these units were non-standard compared to other later DMU vehicles , they were subject to early retirement . The last units were withdrawn from normal traffic in 1969 . 79683 was left over as a spare DTCL , and took the place of 79649 in 1957 , when this was converted into a special saloon . It was later renumbered 999510 in the departmental saloon series and was eventually scrapped in 1981 . In 1962 three of the power twin units were converted to power trailer units , when 79191-79193 were rebuilt as DTCL vehicles and renumbered 79633-79635 . Thanks to their extended life in departmental service , one 2-car unit and a single car unit survive in preservation , the former following a high-profile campaign .
A shareholder or stockholder is an individual or institution ( including a corporation ) that legally owns one or more shares of stock in a public or private corporation . Shareholders own the stock , but not the corporation itself ( Fama 1980 ) . Stockholders are granted special privileges depending on the class of stock . These rights may include : Stockholders or shareholders are considered by some to be a subset of stakeholders , which may include anyone who has a direct or indirect interest in the business entity . For example , labor , suppliers , customers , the community , etc. , are typically considered stakeholders because they contribute value and\/or are impacted by the corporation . Shareholders in the primary market who buy IPOs provide capital to corporations ; however , the vast majority of shareholders are in the secondary market and provide no capital directly to the corporation . Therefore , contrary to popular opinion , shareholders of American public corporations are NOT the ( 1 ) owners of the corporation , ( 2 ) the claimants of the profit , or ( 3 ) investors , as in the contributors of capital .

Angelo Peruzzi , Cavaliere OMRI , ( born 16 February 1970 in Blera , Viterbo ) is an Italian former World Cup-winning football goalkeeper , and a three-time winner of the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year award . Peruzzi retired from professional football after the 2006 â `` 07 season and now works as Ciro Ferrara 's assistant at the Italian under-21 team , a position he was appointed to on October 2010 . Peruzzi began his Serie A career with A.S. Roma in 1987 . He was loaned to Hellas Verona in 1989 , but was suspended for a year in October 1990 after failing a doping test because an appetite suppressant he was taking at the time contained a banned substance . His signing with Juventus in 1991 successfully revived his career , and he soon surpassed Stefano Tacconi as the Turin giants ' starting goalie . Peruzzi won three Scudetti , a UEFA Cup , and was part of Juventus ' 1996 Champions League title squad that defeated AFC Ajax in the final on penalties . After one season with Internazionale , he transferred to Lazio for â 17.9 million in 2000 , and made over 200 appearances in Serie A and European competition with the club . Although his contract with the Biancocelesti ran until 2008 , Peruzzi announced that he would call it quits at the end of the ' 06-07 season after Lazio 's 0-0 draw with Cagliari Calcio on October 15 , 2006 . `` I will retire at the end of the campaign , '' he said . `` I know the Lazio president and fans will not be happy but had I not made this decision , I would remain at the club for another six or eight years . '' He later backtracked on this decision , claiming that his comments were a joke and that it was premature to talk about retirement at this early stage of the season , emphasizing that his potential retirement was being considered `` one season at a time . '' After the 0-0 draw with Roma April 29 , 2007 , Peruzzi confirmed that he had indeed played his last match due to the frustration of nagging injuries , but he was put on for the final few minutes in Lazio 's final home match of the season , a goalless draw against Parma F.C. on May 20 , as a goodbye to the fans . He was named the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year for the third time in his career on January 28 , 2008 ; only he and compatriot Gianluigi Buffon have won the award more than once since its inception in 1997 . Peruzzi was capped 31 times in 11 years with Italy . He was also a member of the national squad that competed at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona and Euro 96 . He was scheduled to be the starter at the 1998 FIFA World Cup , but suffered a late injury and was replaced by Gianluca Pagliuca . He momentarily left the national team in 1999 after a match against Norway , but returned to the Azzurri the following year , with whom he hoped to start at Euro 2000 , but a last-minute injury once again cost him the starting spot as Francesco Toldo led the team to the final . Italy coach Giovanni Trapattoni wanted to call up Peruzzi as the third goalkeeper in the squad for the 2002 World Cup , but Peruzzi refused , saying , `` The mascots for the World Cup have already been chosen . '' Two years later , though , he was called up as the third keeper behind Buffon and Toldo at Euro 2004 . He did n't start for Italy again until a friendly against Spain on April 28 , 2004 , then was the first choice for a pair of WC qualifiers against Scotland and Belarus in August 2005 while Buffon was shelved with a shoulder injury . Peruzzi served as second keeper behind Buffon in the 2006 FIFA World Cup as Italy captured their fourth crown . He retired permanently from international play after the conclusion of the tournament .
MEPIS is a set of Linux distributions , distributed as Live CDs that can be installed onto a hard disk drive . MEPIS is developed and maintained by an active community begun by Warren Woodford and the eponymous company MEPIS LLC . The most popular MEPIS distribution is SimplyMEPIS , which is based primarily on Debian stable . It can either be installed onto a hard drive or used as a Live CD , which makes it externally bootable for troubleshooting and repairing many operating systems . It includes the KDE desktop environment . MEPIS LLC was founded in 2002 and uses the MEPIS Linux distribution as a foundation for MEPIS business partners to build and deploy virtualized data center , secure server and desktop systems that integrate and provide a migration path for utilizing hardware virtualization , IPv6 , IPsec and DNSsec . MEPIS LLC also offers senior consulting services for product strategy , architecture design , business and systems analysis , and cross-platform software development . MEPIS was designed as an alternative to SUSE Linux , Red Hat Linux , and Mandriva Linux ( formerly Mandrake ) which , in the creator Warren Woodford 's opinion , were too difficult for the average user . MEPIS 's first official release was on May 10 , 2003 . In 2006 , MEPIS made a transition from using Debian packages to using Ubuntu packages . SimplyMEPIS 6.0 , released in July 2006 , was the first version of MEPIS to incorporate the Ubuntu packages and repositories . SimplyMEPIS 7.0 discontinued the use of Ubuntu binary packages in favor of a combination of MEPIS packaged binaries based on Debian and Ubuntu source code , combined with a Debian stable OS core and extra packages from Debian package pools . Warren Woodford released the source code for the MEPIS Installer and MEPIS System Assistants under the Apache License , in the Fall of 2008 . Major releases occur about six months to one year apart , based mostly on Warren 's availability to produce the next version . MEPIS Community now has a repo team that strives to keep packages up to date between releases , by maintaining a separate ` Community Repository ' of various application packages , and has become a major player by producing the artwork and documentation for each release . According to Warren Woodford , the name MEPIS is pronounced like `` Memphis '' , with the extra letters removed . Originally , the word `` MEPIS '' did n't mean anything in particular ; it came about by mistake . When Woodford misunderstood a friend over the telephone , he decided to use the name because it was a simple five-letter word and there were no other companies or products with that name .

The Irn-Bru Scottish Football League First Division Championship is the highest division of the Scottish Football League and the second highest in the Scottish football league system . The division was introduced in 1975 â `` 76 in Scottish football to replace the old Scottish Football League Division Two . It contains ten teams and each year the top team is promoted to the Scottish Premier League , subject to meeting the stadium criteria . The bottom club is automatically relegated and the second bottom club goes to an end of season play-off with the second , third and fourth placed clubs from Division Two . The teams play each other four times with three points for a victory and one point each for a drawn game . On 20 July 2007 , it was announced that Scottish Football League would be sponsored by Scottish soft drink Irn-Bru for the next three seasons . Listed below are all the teams competing in the season 2010-11 First Division . The following is a list of the managers for the 2010 â `` 11 season in the Scottish First Division .
Five rounds of a modified version of SHARK can be broken using an interpolation attack ( Jakobsen and Knudsen , 1997 ) . Vulture is the name given to two groups of convergently evolved scavenging birds , the New World Vultures including the well-known Californian and Andean Condors , and the Old World Vultures including the birds which are seen scavenging on carcasses of dead animals on African plains . New World Vultures are found in North and South America , Old World Vultures in Europe , Africa and Asia , meaning that between the two groups , Vultures are found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica . A particular characteristic of many vultures is a bald head , devoid of normal feathers . This helps to keep the head clean when feeding . Research has shown that the bare skin may play an important role in thermoregulation . A group of vultures is called a wake , committee , or venue . The word Geier ( taken from the German language ) does not have a precise meaning in ornithology , and it is occasionally used to refer to a vulture in English , as in some poetry . Vultures are classified into two groups : Old World Vultures and New World Vultures . The similarities between the two different groups are due to convergent evolution . The Old World Vultures found in Africa , Asia , and Europe belong to the family Accipitridae , which also includes eagles , kites , buzzards , and hawks . Old World vultures find carcasses exclusively by sight . The New World Vultures and condors found in warm and temperate areas of the Americas are not closely related to the similar Accipitridae , but belong in the family Cathartidae , which was once considered to be related to the storks . However , recent DNA evidence suggests that they should be included among the Accipitriformes , along with other birds of prey . However , they are still not closely related to the other vultures , and their shared similarities are due to convergent evolution . Several species have a good sense of smell , unusual for raptors , and are able to smell the dead they focus upon from great heights , up to a mile away . Vultures seldom attack healthy animals , but may kill the wounded or sick . When a carcass has too thick a hide for its beak to open , it waits for a larger scavenger to eat first . Vast numbers have been seen upon battlefields . They gorge themselves when prey is abundant , till their crop bulges , and sit , sleepy or half torpid , to digest their food . They do not carry food to their young in their claws , but disgorge it from the crop . These birds are of great value as scavengers , especially in hot regions . Vulture stomach acid is exceptionally corrosive , allowing them to safely digest putrid carcasses infected with Botulinum toxin , hog cholera , and anthrax bacteria that would be lethal to other scavengers . This also enables them to use their reeking , corrosive vomit as a defensive projectile when threatened .
Antimony trichloride is the chemical compound with the formula SbCl3 . The soft colorless solid with a pungent odor was known to the alchemists as butter of antimony . Antimony trichloride is prepared by reaction of chlorine with antimony , antimony trioxide or antimony trisulfide . It also may be made by treating antimony trioxide with concentrated hydrochloric acid . On contact with water , it undergoes hydrolysis , forming antimony oxychloride and releasing hydrogen chloride . Thus , samples of SbCl3 must be protected from moisture . SbCl3 + H2O â ' SbOCl + 2HCl Further indicating its Lewis acidity , SbCl3 forms adducts with chloride , e.g. ( SbCl5 ) 2 â ' . Antimony trichloride can behave as a Lewis base . However , such reactions are very limited . They include the formation of carbonyl complexes Fe ( CO ) 3 ( SbCl3 ) 2 and Ni ( CO ) 3SbCl3 . SbCl3 is a reagent for detecting vitamin A and related carotenoids in the Carr-Price test . The antimony trichloride reacts with the carotenoid to form a blue complex that can be measured by colorimetry . Antimony trichloride has also been used to enhance the louche effect in absinthe . It has been used in the past to dissolve and remove horn stubs from calves without having to cut them off . It is also used as a catalyst for polymerization , hydrocracking and chlorination reactions ; as a mordant ; and in the production of other antimony salts . Its solution is used as an analytical reagent for chloral , aromatics and vitamin A. In episode 12 of the third season of the popular British program All Creatures Great and Small , several calves died following an episode of nonspecific gastroenteritis , the cause of which was later determined to be ingestion of antimony trichloride present in a solution used to dissolve their horn stubs .
Lake Washington is a large freshwater lake adjacent to the city of Seattle . It is the largest lake in King County and the second largest in the state of Washington , after Lake Chelan . It is bordered by the cities of Seattle on the west , Bellevue and Kirkland on the east , Renton on the south and Kenmore on the north , and surrounds Mercer Island . The lake is fed by the Sammamish River at its north end and the Cedar River at its south . Lake Washington received its present name in 1854 after Thomas Mercer suggested it be named after George Washington , as the new Washington Territory had been named the year before . The Duwamish called it XacuabÅ ( Lushootseed : literally great-amount-of-water ) . Around 1900s the city began discharging sewage into Lake Washington . After significant pollution , the October 5 , 1963 issue of the Post Intelligencer referred to the lake as `` Lake Stinko '' . Since then , Lake Washington has undergone major improvements , drastically improving the ecology and water quality , turning the water to twice as clear as it was in 1950 . Kenmore Air operates passenger seaplane service at Kenmore Air Harbor at the northern end of the lake . A ribbon lake , Lake Washington is long , narrow and finger-like . Ribbon lakes are excavated by glaciers . As the Puget lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet flowed south near the end of the Late Pleistocene , it met bands of harder and softer rock . Erosion of the softer rock was faster and a linear depression was created in the flow direction . When the glacier melted the lake filled with the meltwater , which was retained by moraine deposits . A dam can also be created by the bands of harder rock either side of the softer rock . There is usually a river at both ends of a ribbon lake , one being the inlet , and the other , the outlet -- though in the case of present day Lake Washington , inlet rivers are located at both ends . Before construction of the Lake Washington Ship Canal in 1916 , Lake Washington 's outlet was the Black River , which joined the Duwamish River and emptied into Elliott Bay . When the canal was opened the level of the lake dropped nearly nine feet ( 3 m ) . The canal to the Puget Sound became the lake 's sole outlet , causing the Black River to dry up and disappear . Concrete floating bridges were employed to span the lake because Lake Washington 's depth and muddy bottom prevented the emplacement of the pilings or towers necessary for the construction of a causeway or suspension bridge . The bridges consist of hollow concrete pontoons that float atop the lake , anchored with cables to each other and to weights on the lake bottom . The roadway is constructed atop these concrete pontoons . Three floating bridges cross Lake Washington : the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge ( officially the Governor Albert D. Rosellini Bridge - Evergreen Point ) carries State Route 520 from Seattle 's Montlake neighborhood to Medina while the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge and the Third Lake Washington Bridge ( officially the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge ) carries Interstate 90 from Seattle 's Mount Baker neighborhood to Mercer Island . The East Channel Bridge carries Interstate 90 from Mercer Island to Bellevue . The Evergreen Point , Lacey V. Murrow , and Third Lake Washington bridges are the longest , second longest , and fifth longest floating bridges in the world , respectively . Many questioned the wisdom of concrete floating bridge technology after the sinking of a portion of the Lacey V. Murrow bridge on November 25 , 1990 . However , a Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) investigation revealed that that incident resulted from the improper handling of hydrodemolition water being used during bridge renovations , rather than in any basic flaw in the bridge 's concept or design . Concrete floating bridges continue to remain a viable means for the conveyance of vehicle traffic over Lake Washington . In 1950 , approximately one year after the tolls were removed from the Murrow bridge , the inland ferry system on the lake came to an end , having operated since the 1880s . The cities and towns bordering the lake , going clockwise from the west , are Seattle , Lake Forest Park , Kenmore , Kirkland , Yarrow Point , Hunts Point , Medina , Bellevue , Beaux Arts Village , Newcastle , and Renton . The city of Mercer Island occupies the island of the same name , in the southern half of the lake .
This article is about the historical French province . For other uses , see Picardy ( disambiguation ) . Picardy is a historical province of France , in the north of France . The historical capital and largest city is Amiens . The area was occupied by the Franks in the 5th century and in the feudal period it encompassed the six countships of Boulogne , Montreuil , Ponthieu , AmiÃ nois , Vermandois , and Laonnois . During the Middle Ages , the name applied to an area much larger than what is now thought of as Picardy , the name ` Picardy ' referred to that part of France north of Paris , and it even included the Dutch speaking Flanders . This area corresponds to all the territories from Paris to the Netherlands . In the Latin Quarter of Paris , people identified a `` Picardy Nation '' ( Nation Picarde ) of students , most of whom actually came from Flanders , who studied in the prestigious Sorbonne University . In a narrower sense , Picardy refers to the area covered by the gouvernement ( military region ) of Picardy as created in the 16th century . This area is the Somme dÃ partement , the northern half of the Aisne dÃ partement , and a small fringe in the north of the Oise dÃ partement . This is what most people think of as Picardy today . The older definition survives in the name of the Picard language , which applies not only to the dialects of Picardy proper , but also to the Romance dialects spoken in the Nord-Pas de Calais rÃ gion , north of Picardy proper . Picardy proper now lies inside the administrative region of Picardy , making up half of this region . Before the French Revolution , the coastal areas of Boulogne-sur-Mer and Calais were considered part of Picardy , but are now part of the Nord-Pas de Calais rÃ gion . However , anciently these areas belonged to the province of Artois , and had been detached from Artois in the 15th century . The region of Picardy has a strong and proud cultural identity . The Picard ( the local inhabitant and traditionally Picard language speakers ) cultural heritage includes some of the most extraordinary Gothic churches ( Amiens and Beauvais cathedrals or Saint-Quentin basilica ) , distinctive local cuisine ( including ficelle picarde , flamiche aux poireaux , tarte au maroilles ) , beer ( including from PÃ ronne 's de Clercq brewery ) and traditional games and sports , such as the longue paume ( ancestor of tennis ) , as well as danses picardes and its own bagpipes , called the pipasso . Northern Picardy is a vast plain with open fields , famed for the gruesome Battle of the Somme . The region stretches from the long sand beaches of the Somme estuary in the west to the vast forests and pastures of the ThiÃ rache in the east and down to the chateaux of Chantilly or Pierrefonds near the Paris Area and vineyards of the border with Champagne ( Champagne picarde ) to the south . The main crops of Picardy are wheat , sugar beet , and fodder . Sugar beet was introduced by Napoleon I during the Napoleonic Wars in order to counter the United Kingdom which had seized the sugar islands possessed by France in the Caribbean . The sugar industry made the fortune of Picardy in the 19th century . Villages of Picardy have a distinct character , with their houses made of red bricks , often graced with a `` lace '' of white bricks . A minority of people still speak the Picard language , one of the languages of France , which is also spoken in Artois ( Nord-Pas de Calais rÃ gion ) . `` P ` tit quinquin '' , a Picard song , is a symbol of the local culture ( and of that of Artois ) . In 2009 , the Regional Committee for local government reform proposed to reduce the number of French regions and cancel out additions of new regions in the near future . Picardy impacted by the reform would have disappearedand each department would have joined a nearby region . Ile-de-France ( would have incorporated the Oise ) , Nord-Pas-de-Calais ( would have incorporated the Somme and Aisne and\/or Champagne-Ardenne ( for the Aisne ) . The vast majority of Picards were opposed to this proposal and it was scrapped in 2010 ( see newspaper : `` Courrier Picard '' ) .

Nucleobases ( or nucleotide bases\/nitrogenous bases\/aglycones ) are the parts of DNA and RNA that may be involved in pairing ( see also base pairs ) . The primary nucleobases are cytosine , guanine , adenine ( DNA and RNA ) , thymine ( DNA ) and uracil ( RNA ) , abbreviated as C , G , A , T , and U , respectively . They are usually simply called bases in genetics . Because A , G , C , and T appear in the DNA , these molecules are called DNA-bases ; A , G , C , and U are called RNA-bases . Uracil replaces thymine in RNA . These two bases are identical except that uracil lacks the 5 ' methyl group . Adenine and guanine belong to the double-ringed class of molecules called purines ( abbreviated as R ) . Cytosine , thymine , and uracil are all pyrimidines ( abbreviated as Y ) . The compound formed when a nucleobase forms a glycosidic bond with the 1 ' anomeric carbon of a ribose or deoxyribose is called a nucleoside , and a nucleoside with one or more phosphate groups attached at the 5 ' carbon is called a nucleotide . Apart from adenine ( A ) , cytosine ( C ) , guanine ( G ) , thymine ( T ) and uracil ( U ) , DNA and RNA also contain bases that have been modified after the nucleic acid chain has been formed . In DNA , the most common modified base is 5-methylcytidine ( m5C ) . In RNA , there are many modified bases , including pseudouridine ( Î ) , dihydrouridine ( D ) , inosine ( I ) , ribothymidine ( rT ) and 7-methylguanosine ( m7G ) . Hypoxanthine and xanthine are two of the many bases created through mutagen presence , both of them through deamination ( replacement of the amine-group with a carbonyl-group ) . Hypoxanthine is produced from adenine , xanthine from guanine . In similar manner , deamination of cytosine results in uracil . These are incorporated into the growing chain during RNA and\/or DNA synthesis . These are examples of modified adenosine or guanosine . These are examples of modified cytidine , thymidine or uridine . A vast number of nucleobase analogs exist . The most common applications are used as fluorescent probes , either directly or indirectly , such as aminoallyl nucleotide , which are used to label cRNA or cDNA in microarrays . Several groups are working on alternative `` extra '' base pairs to extend the genetic code , such as isoguanine and isocytosine or the fluorescent 2-amino-6 - ( 2-thienyl ) purine and pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde . In medicine , several nucleoside analogs are used as anticancer and antiviral agents . The viral polymerase incorporates these compounds with non-canon bases . These compounds are activated in the cells by being converted into nucleotides , they are administered as nuclosides as charged nucleotides can not easily cross cell membranes .
Motohiro Yamaguchi ( born 29 January 1969 in Takasaki , Gunma , Japan ) is a Japanese former football midfielder . He was capped 58 times and scored 4 goals for the Japanese national team between 1995 and 1998 , including three games at the 1998 FIFA World Cup .
Marcio Ferreira Nobre ( born November 6 , 1980 in JateÃ ) , also known as Mert Nobre , is a Brazilian football ( soccer ) player . He plays at the striker position . He also holds Turkish nationality . Nobre was transferred to FenerbahÃ e SK after his former team-mate , Alex , was snapped up by the club for an astronomic fee . Joining during the winter break , he would finish the season efficiently , scoring 12 goals in 18 matches . After FenerbahÃ e lost the 2005\/06 title , Nobre was released due to the rule of 6 non-Turkish players in a squad limit . At the end of 2005\/06 season he moved to archrivals BeÅ iktaÅ from Cruzeiro in a 2 million euro deal . At the start of the 2006\/07 season , he changed his name to Mert Nobre , after he gained Turkish citizenship . He currently has the chance of playing for the Turkey national football team if he is elected by the manager , following in suit of former team-mate and friend , Mehmet AurÃ lio . He played at Paysandu , XV de Piracicaba , Sport , ParanÃ Clube , Kashiwa Reysol , Cruzeiro , FenerbahÃ e SK and is currently playing at BeÅ iktaÅ of Turkey .

JosÃ Carlos da Costa AraÃ jo , best known as ZÃ Carlos ( February 7 , 1962 - July 24 , 2009 ) was a Brazilian football goalkeeper who played for the Brazilian national team in the 1990 FIFA World Cup . Throughout his career ( 1983 -- 2000 ) he played for Americano de Campos , Flamengo , Rio Branco , Cruzeiro , VitÃ ria , XV de Piracicaba , AmÃ rica and TubarÃ # o. He played also in Portugal , where he defended VitÃ ria de GuimarÃ # es , SC Farense , and Felgueiras . The best moment in his career came when he played for Flamengo , in the late eighties , when he won one Brazilian championship in 1987 and one Rio de Janeiro state championship in 1986 . At that time he was often called up for the Brazilian national football team , but was usually the second goalkeeper after Taffarel . That was the case in the 1988 Olympics . He did play on two occasions in 1989 . However , during the 1990 FIFA World Cup , he only made the third goalkeeper , after Taffarel and AcÃ cio . ZÃ Carlos died on July 24 , 2009 of abdominal cancer , after more than one month at a hospital in Rio de Janeiro . On July 26 , 2009 , after Flamengo defeated Santos for the first time in official matches playing at Vila Belmiro ( Santos ' stadium ) , the current manager of Flamengo , Andrade , who was ZÃ Carlos ' friend and teammate in the 1980s , both in Flamengo and in Brazilian team , crying , dedicated the special victory to ZÃ Carlos .
Bracha Peli ( 1892-1986 ) was the owner of Massada , a publishing company in Israel , and the driving force behind the publication of The General Encyclopedia and Encyclopaedia Hebraica . She is credited with starting Israel 's annual Hebrew Book Week . The Encyclopaedia Hebraica project began using Bracha Peli 's publishing house in 1946 with her son , Alexander , supervising . The last volume was published in 1996 Bracha Peli ( Bronya Kutzenok ) was born in Starovitzky , a small village in what is now Ukraine . to a family of Hasidic Jews . She gained an education by overhearing lessons given to her six elder brothers . Early on , she became proficient in Yiddish , Russian and Hebrew . In 1905 , when she was about to study at a Gymnasium in Kiev , pogroms against the Jews erupted , disrupting her plans . She waited two years to complete her secondary education . On her own initiative she registered for a course in economics , which would be useful for a career in business . In 1914 , after her mother died of tuberculosis , Peli met a young Zionist teacher , Meir Pilipovetsky , whom she married against her family 's wishes . After her son , Alexander , was born she opened a Jewish secondary school which attracted 400 students in its first year . In July 1921 , Peli and her husband left Russia . They settled in Palestine and helped to form the young city of Tel Aviv . In 1926 , Peli , opened a stall in Tel Aviv to sell books cheaply which led to the inauguration of an annual event . Today Hebrew Book Week is a national 10-day event . Bracha Peli died in 1986 .
Blackfriars is an area of central London , which lies in the south-west corner of the City of London . The name Blackfriars was first used in 1317 ( as Black Freres from the French ` frÃ re ' meaning ` brother ' ) and derives from the black cappa worn by the Dominican Friars who moved their priory from Holborn to the area between the River Thames and Ludgate Hill in 1276 . Edward I gave permission to rebuild London 's city wall , which lay between the river and Ludgate Hill , around their area . The site was used for great occasions of state , including meetings of Parliament and the Privy Council , as well as the location for a divorce hearing in 1529 of Catherine of Aragon and Henry VIII . The priory was eventually closed in 1538 during Henry 's Dissolution of the monasteries . Some of the buildings were subsequently leased to a group of entrepreneurs who created the Blackfriars Theatre on the site , not far from Shakespeare 's Globe Theatre which sat almost directly across on the other side of the river . In 1632 , the Society of Apothecaries ( a livery company ) , acquired the monastery 's guesthouse and established their base there . The building was destroyed in the Great Fire of London but the Society rebuilt and Apothecaries Hall is still to be found in Blackfriars today . The area is now the location of Blackfriars station , and forms the northern bridge-head for both Blackfriars Bridge and Blackfriars Railway Bridge . Alongside the road bridge is Blackfriars Millennium Pier , a stop for river bus services on London River Services . The Victoria Embankment stretches along the north bank of the river west from Blackfriars to Westminster Bridge . Notable buildings in the area include the large Art Deco Unilever House . The area was once served by a station south of the river Blackfriars Bridge railway station , taking its name from Blackfriars Bridge . It was closed to passengers in 1885 when the current Blackfriars station was opened . The older parts of Blackfriars have regularly been used as a filming location in film and television , particularly for modern films and serials set in Victorian times ; notably Sherlock Holmes , David Copperfield .

Dario Dainelli ( born 9 June 1979 in Pontedera , Province of Pisa ) is an Italian footballer who plays as a defender for Serie A club Genoa . Dainelli started his professional career at Empoli . He spent his early years on Modena ( Serie C1 ) , Cavese ( Serie C2 ) and Fidelis Andria ( Serie C1 ) on loan . He was then signed by Lecce in 2000 ( in co-ownership deal and made his Serie A debut against Roma on 18 February 2001 . After just one season at Lecce , Empoli bought him back and sold to Brescia . Except for the first season which he just made five appearances and left on loan to Serie A rival Verona , he made 56 appearances more for Brescia . In July 2004 he was signed by newly promoted team Fiorentina , in a co-ownership deal with Brescia . On January 2005 , Fiorentina immediately bought all of the remain registration rights . Dainelli was the team captain after Christian RiganÃ left the club in summer 2005 , a position which he hold until his transfer to Genoa . At the end of 2006 â `` 07 season , due to his contract expiring on summer , some rumor linked him with Juventus and other Italian clubs , but on 9 June 2007 , he finally signed a new 4 years contract extension with Fiorentina . In summer 2009 , ACF Fiorentina prepared to sell the captain by signing Cesare Natali in order to increase the depth of the bench . Alessandro Gamberini , Per KrÃ ldrup and Dainelli rotated at the starting pair of the central defender . After the signing of Felipe , on 12 January 2010 Dainelli was transferred to Genoa with whom he signed a contract which last until June 2013 . Dainelli made his debut for the national side against Ecuador on 11 June 2005 which the friendly match ended a 1 â `` 1 draw . He was recalled by new Italian head coach Roberto Donadoni to play in Euro 2008 qualifying against Lithuania and France on 2 September 2006 and 6 September 2006 , but did not enter the field . Dainelli played once for Italy U21 team , on 16 April , 2002 . a friendly 2 â `` 3 lost to France U21 . He also call-up to 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship , but did not play .
Potassium carbonate ( K2CO3 ) is a white salt , soluble in water ( insoluble in alcohol ) , which forms a strongly alkaline solution . It can be made as the product of potassium hydroxide 's absorbent reaction with carbon dioxide . It is deliquescent , often appearing a damp or wet solid . Potassium carbonate is used in the production of soap and glass . Potassium carbonate was first identified in 1742 by Antonio Campanella and is the primary component of potash and the more refined pearl ash or salts of tartar . Historically pearl ash was created by baking potash in a kiln to remove impurities . The fine white powder remaining was the pearl ash . The first patent issued by the U.S. Patent Office was awarded to Samuel Hopkins in 1790 for an improved method of making potash and pearl ash . In late 18th century North America , before the development of baking powder , pearl ash was used as a leavening agent in quick breads . Today potassium carbonate is prepared commercially by the electrolysis of potassium chloride . The resulting potassium hydroxide is then carbonated using carbon dioxide to form potassium carbonate , which is often used to produce other . 2KOH + CO2 K2CO3 + H2O Pearl ash has been used for soap , glass , and china production . Pearl ash added to hard water will soften the water . In the laboratory , it may be used as a mild drying agent where other drying agents such as calcium chloride and magnesium sulfate may be incompatible . However , it is not suitable for acidic compounds , but can be useful for drying an organic phase if one has a small amount of acidic impurity . Mixed with water it causes an exothermic reaction .

However , on March 3 , 2008 , after merely one 1\/2 months in charge , he resigned , arguing that never , as a manager , had he lost four games in a row , and that he did not feel up to the task of stopping the side 's slump into the relegation zone ( eventually , the Aragonese were relegated ) . He was quickly replaced by former Zaragoza goalkeeper Manolo Villanova , whom at the time coached Sociedad Deportiva Huesca .

Servite College is a co-educational Roman Catholic high school in the Perth suburb of Tuart Hill , Western Australia . The school is operated by the Servite Order . Members of the Servite Order came to Australia in late 1951 and by 1958 had established St. Philipâ s Regional High School for Boys in Tuart Hill . In 1968 the name was changed to Servite College , and in 1973 it became the first co-educational Catholic secondary school in Western Australia . Information Technology is prominent ; the Seven Holy Founders Centre gym and auditorium are the pride of the school . A state-of-the-art science block , completed in 2003 , is the most recent addition . In spite of severe limitations on space , there are abundant opportunities for sports both within the confines of the campus as well as at a large nearby public oval . Servite Collegeâ s participation in inter-school sports competitions has been very rewarding . In 2009 , the school underwent a minor scale structure change ; year seven students ( typically ages 11 and 12 ) were introduced to the school as the Saint Alexis technology wing was demolished to build a newer building , all students do exams half-yearly ( per semester ) , and year ten students now are able to choose from a variety of Western Australian Certificate of Education ( previously Tertiary Entrance Exam ) subjects in the preparation for their upper school levels ( years 11 and 12 ) . The students are put into six priories ( or factions ) : Annuziata ( yellow ) , Our Lady of Sorrows ( purple ) , San Clemente ( green ) , Senario ( black ) , Saint Anthony 's ( red ) and Saint Mary 's ( light blue ) . Each played a role in the history of the Servite Order that was founded in Italy around 1200AD by the seven holy founders . They are further split into contact groups of about 25 students ; each containing years 7-12 . Besides the large number of General Learning Areas ( commonly known as classrooms ) expected in any school , Servite College boasts an extensive Technology Centre , a state-of-the-art science block , a large auditorium\/lecture theater seating over 200 persons as well as an international standard gymnasium . These areas do not have airconditioning . The central area of the campus is pleasantly landscaped and offers ample opportunity for students to gather , converse and socialise . A large practical and creative arts center is located in a separate building ; here are found facilities for woodwork , cooking as well as drama and dance . Music theory and practice is catered for in several adjacent locations . All in all we have in Servite an institution well equipped to educate and care for the more than 900 students who frequent it . Servite however does not have an oval or swimming pool , which often restricts a number of sporting achievements and does not allow the students ample opportunity . In 2008 Servite demolished the 50 year old southern wing of the school ( excluding a small part of the library , which presently ( Nov 2010 ) is being torn down ) in order to build a modern , three story high building that was to be named after Fr Chris Ross who began his journey many years ago in a Chicago Servite school ; however , he felt inclined to pass the naming of the building to celebrated Servite saint Saint Alexis . He has done a lot of work towards the school and is currently the School 's council president . Servite College competes in the Northern Associated Schools ( NAS ) league and the Associated Catholic Colleges ' annual swimming and athletic carnivals . Its NAS competitors include Sacred Heart College , Chisholm College , Newman College and John XXIII College in Perth . Servite college has been the most successful school in both leagues despite its small size of around 900 .

Laney Amplification is a British brand of guitar\/bass guitar amplifiers and cabinets , and also public address systems . Laney Amplification officially began on September 1st , 1967 . As a bassist playing the local circuits with the likes of Robert Plant and John Bonham , Lyndon Laney decided to turn his hand to building amplifiers for friends in his parents ' garden shed . Some of Lyndon 's first customers were local Birmingham-based guitar players such as Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath who remains loyal to Laney to this day . Many of the first Laney amplifiers ever built are still around and in use , slowly becoming as revered as other vintage amplifiers by Marshall and Fender for their pure valve-driven tone . The late 1960s\/early 1970s range consisted of a small number of amplifiers , but with a dedicated following . The original LA100BL all-valve model was the choice of many players wanting a more ` heavy metal ' guitar sound than other popular amplifiers . Laney also created a series of amplifiers known as KLIPP , which featured a built-in treble booster similar to the Dallas Rangemaster . KLIPP amps offer excellent versatility and durability , and are sought after especially by collectors in the USA vintage market . The quest for more gain while still retaining a natural all-valve tone became the driving force behind Laney 's 1980s range of amplification . Laney was at the forefront of amp design when it came to this ` hot-rodded ' sound . A line called `` AOR '' , short for Advanced Overdrive Response , introduced an extra stage of preamp gain while still retaining a pure signal path . Whereas amplifiers from other competitors like Marshall were being modified after purchase , Laney offered this extra stage as a stock feature . Throughout the 1990s Laney continued to build on its reputation for innovation : by the middle of the decade products such as the VC30 were released ( a retro-style Class A valve combo reminiscent of the famous Vox AC30 , but with more features ) , the VC50\/VC100 combos with two channels , each with a separate boost for adding more gain and volume effectively offering a player four different sounds , and the single channel GH50L\/GH100L stacks which are among the best-selling models ever made by the company . They also during this time bought HH Electronics . Introduced in this period was the Tube Fusion series - combining solid state power amplification with valve pre-amplication and also incorporating DSP elements to add modulation\/delay effects in one package . Notable users of Laney Amplification products include : Paul Gilbert , Tony Iommi , Steve Vai , Steve Rothery , Ace Frehley , Timo Tolkki , Mikael Ã kerfeldt , Elizabeth Buckingham .
Interstate 97 ( abbreviated I-97 ) is an intrastate Interstate Highway located entirely within Anne Arundel County , Maryland , United States . It runs from Annapolis at the overlapped section of US 50 , US 301 , and the unsigned I-595 to Baltimore at the city 's beltway . Originally seen as a spur route , to be designated Interstate 297 , it was planned to be built along the Maryland Route 3 corridor , but the proposed route was canceled because of local opposition . Completed in 1993 , I-97 is currently the shortest two-digit interstate highway in the country , the only two-digit interstate highway on the U.S. mainland located entirely within one county , and the only two-digit interstate highway on the U.S. mainland that does not connect to any other two-digit interstate highways . Interstate 97 begins at US 50\/US 301\/unsigned I-595 with a pair of collector distributor roadways feeding directly into I-97 at a directional-T interchange . To the south , the same C\/D roads become Maryland Route 665 as a direct freeway spur into Annapolis . Directly afterward , I-97 passes over Maryland Route 450 with no interchange . The road continues northwest , weaving through a heavily wooded area with very few interactions with other roads . Its first interchange is with Maryland Route 178 , though it is only accessible from the southbound carriageway , and traffic only enters into the northbound . There are no northbound off-ramps until exit 7 , where the route interchanges with the ends of both Maryland Route 3 and Maryland Route 32 . Within this interchange , Interstate 97 turns to the northeast and follows the former Maryland Route 3 , shifts from a rural Interstate with few exits to a more urban one . Along the former MD 3 corridor that Interstate 97 now follows , development begins to grow closer to the highway , and the route 's road surface changes from asphalt to concrete for the remainder of the route . In Glen Burnie the route interchanges with Maryland Route 3 Business , a former alignment of MD 3 that now no longer connects directly to its parent route . Beyond this , it interchanges with Maryland Route 100 , another important freeway in Anne Arundel County . It passes over the Baltimore Light Rail as it crosses and interchanges with Maryland Route 648 a little while later , near Cromwell Station . Interstate 97 ends outside of Baltimore at an interchange with the Baltimore Beltway , one of a series of interconnected interchanges which includes Maryland Route 2 and a spur of Interstate 895 . The main carriageways become the I-895 spur , while the ramps to the westbound Beltway become the latter route 's main travel lanes . The entire route is in Anne Arundel County .

Campagna ( Italian : , Neapolitan : Campagn , IPA : \/ kamË paÉ É \/ ) is a small town and comune of the province of Salerno , in the Campania region of Southern Italy . The town , located in a mountainous district , gradually lost importance in the 20th century . All its district offices have been moved to other cities since the 1930s , and the Diocese of Campagna merged with the Archdiocese of Salerno in 1973 . During World War II , Campagna was the site of an internment camp . The Bishop Giuseppe Maria Palatucci turned the camp into a shelter for Italian and foreign Jews , many of them sent there for protection by his nephew Giovanni Palatucci ; Giovanni was later honored as a Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial . Much of this is documented in Elizabeth Bettina 's book , It Happened in Italy . The town has got 8 frazioni ( civil parrishes ) : Camaldoli , Galdo , Mattinelle , Puglietta , Quadrivio , Romandola-Madonna del Ponte , Santa Maria La Nova , Serradarce . Other localitÃ ( inhabited locality and scattered houses ) are : Avigliano , Folcata , Oppidi-Varano , Persano Scalo , Pezzarotonda , Ponte Barbieri , Rufigliano , Saginara , San Paolo , San Vito , San Zaccaria , Sant ` Angelo , Tuoro , Vallegrini .
Northern Italy is a wide cultural , historical and geographical definition , without any administrative usage , used to indicate the northern part of the Italian state , also referred as Settentrione . It comprises two areas belonging to Italian First level NTUS of the European Union : By far the larger portion of Northern Italy is occupied by the basin of the Po river , which comprises the whole of the broad plain extending from the foot of the Apennines to that of the Alps , together with the valleys and slopes on both sides of it . Throughout its whole course indeed , from its source in Monte Viso to its outflow into the Adriatic Seaâ '' a distance of more than 5 degrees of longitude , or 220 miles in a direct lineâ '' the Po receives all the waters that flow from the Apennines northwards , and all those that descend from the Alps towards the south , till one comes to the Adige , which , after pursuing a parallel course with the Po for a considerable distance , enters the Adriatic by a separate mouth . Northern Italy is the most developed and productive area of the country , and the first part of Italy to be industrialized in the last half of the 19th century , the so called industrial triangle formed by the manufacturing centres of Milan and Turin and the seaport of Genoa . With a 2007 nominal GDP estimated in â 834.7 billion , Northern Italy accounts for almost 54 % of the national economy .
According to official population data from INE , the municipality of Jerez had 205,364 inhabitants as of January 1 , 2008 . This makes Jerez the most populous city in the province , fifth in Andalusia , and 27th in Spain . Limited government is a government in which anything more than minimal governmental intervention in personal liberties and the economy is generally disallowed by law , usually in a written constitution . It is related to free market libertarianism and classical liberalism and some tendencies of liberalism and conservatism in the United States . The theory of limited government contrasts , for example , with the idea that government should intervene to promote equality and opportunity through regulation of property and wealth redistribution . In Western civilization , the Magna Carta and the United States Constitution are examples of the limiting of government powers while establishing a central government . In 1789 , James Madison presented to the First United States Congress a series of ten amendments to the United States Constitution which are today known as the Bill of Rights . After enumerating specific rights retained by the people in the first eight amendments , the Ninth Amendment and the Tenth Amendment summarily spelled out the principle of limited government . Together , these two last Amendments clarify the differences between the unenumerated ( as well as enumerated ) rights of the people versus the expressly codified delegated powers of the federal government . The Ninth Amendment codified that the rights of the people do not have to be expressly written in the Constitution ( i.e. , do not have to be enumerated ) to still be retained by the people . In the reverse , though , the Tenth Amendment codified that any delegated powers of the federal government are only authorized to be performed so long as such delegated powers are expressly delegated to the federal government specifically by the U.S. Constitution . The U.S. Constitution limits the power of the government in several ways .

Mount Edziza is a stratovolcano in the Stikine Country of northwestern British Columbia , Canada . The volcano and the surrounding area are protected within Mount Edziza Provincial Park . It consists of a complex of multiple peaks and ridges , with several glaciers flowing in all directions . The summit is topped by an ice-filled caldera , which is almost 2 k wide . The three main peaks around the summit caldera are the southwest summit , the southeast summit and the north summit . Mount Edziza is Canada 's highest volcano at 2787 m. However , Mount Silverthrone in southwestern British Columbia , has a height of 2865 m and might be the highest volcano in Canada . But it has never been determined if Silverthrone 's 2865 m high point is actually volcanic rock or not ( it is covered by snow and ice ) , making Mount Edziza the highest confirmed volcano in Canada . As early as 10,000 years ago , the Tahltan people , who now live in Dease Lake , Telegraph Creek and the Iskut , used obsidian from Mount Edziza to make tools and weapons for trading material . This is the main source of obsidian found in northwestern British Columbia , which was traded as far away as Alaska and northern Alberta . Obsidian is a type of naturally occurring glass that is highly valued for its cutting qualities . Like all glass and some other types of naturally occurring rocks , obsidian breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture , creating razor sharp edges . More recently , Mount Edziza was made into the Mount Edziza Provincial Park to preserve the volcanic and culture treasures unique to the northern British Columbia area . It encompasses over 230,000 hectares of the Tahltan Highland . There is no vehicle access to the park , and there are only a very few basic facilities .

Avant-garde music is a term used to characterize music which is thought to be ahead of its time , i.e. containing innovative elements or fusing different genres . Historically speaking , musicologists primarily use the term `` avant-garde music '' for the radical , post-1945 tendencies of a modernist style in several genres of art music after the death of Anton Webern in 1945 . In the 1950s the term avant-garde music was mostly associated with serial music . Today the term may be used to refer to any other post-1945 tendency of modernist music not definable as experimental music , though sometimes including a type of experimental music characterized by the rejection of tonality .

The Princess Mary , Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh ( 25 April 1776 â `` 30 April 1857 ) was a member of the British Royal Family , the eleventh child and fourth daughter of George III . She was married to Prince William Frederick , Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh . Princess Mary was born , on 25 April 1776 , at Buckingham Palace , London . Her father was the reigning British monarch , George III . Her mother was Queen Charlotte , the daughter of Charles , reigning Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz . Mary was christened on 19 May 1776 , in the Great Council Chamber at St. James 's Palace , by Frederick Cornwallis , The Archbishop of Canterbury . Her godparents were : Mary danced a minuet for the first time in public at the age of sixteen in June 1791 , during a court ball given for the king 's birthday . In the spring of 1792 she officially debuted at court . She was considered to be the most beautiful of the six daughters of George III . Around 1796 Mary fell in love with the Dutch prince Frederick , while he and his family lived in exile in London . Frederik was a son of William V , Prince of Orange , the Dutch stadholder , and younger brother to the future King William I of the Netherlands . However Frederik and Mary never wed because George III stipulated that her elder sisters should marry first . In 1799 Prince Frederik died of an infection while serving in the army , and Mary was allowed to go into official mourning .

Cultural geography is a sub-field within human geography . Cultural geography is the study of cultural products and norms and their variations across and relations to spaces and places . It focuses on describing and analyzing the ways language , religion , economy , government and other cultural phenomena vary or remain constant , from one place to another and on explaining how humans function spatially . The areas of study of cultural geography are very broad . Among many applicable topics within the field of study are : Though the first traces of the study of different nations and cultures on Earth can be dated back to ancient geographers such as Ptolemy or Strabo , cultural geography as academic study firstly emerged as an alternative to the environmental determinist theories of the early Twentieth century , which had believed that people and societies are controlled by the environment in which they develop . Rather than studying pre-determined regions based upon environmental classifications , cultural geography became interested in cultural landscapes . This was led by Carl O. Sauer ( called the father of cultural geography ) , at the University of California , Berkeley . As a result , cultural geography was long dominated by American writers . Sauer defined the landscape as the defining unit of geographic study . He saw that cultures and societies both developed out of their landscape , but also shaped them too . This interaction between the ` natural ' landscape and humans creates the ` cultural landscape ' . Sauer 's work was highly qualitative and descriptive and was surpassed in the 1930s by the regional geography of Richard Hartshorne , followed by the quantitative revolution . Cultural geography was generally sidelined , though writers such as David Lowenthal continued to work on the concept of landscape . In the 1970s , the critique of positivism in geography caused geographers to look beyond the quantitative geography for its ideas . One of these re-assessed areas was also cultural geography . Since the 1980s , a `` new cultural geography '' has emerged , drawing on a diverse set of theoretical traditions , including Marxist political-economic models , feminist theory , post-colonial theory , post-structuralism and psychoanalysis . Drawing particularly from the theories of Michel Foucault and performativity in western academia , and the more diverse influences of postcolonial theory , there has been a concerted effort to deconstruct the cultural in order to make apparent the various power relations . A particular area of interest is that of identity politics and construction of identity . Some within the ` new cultural geography ' have turned their attention to critiquing some of its ideas , seeing its views on identity and space as static . It has followed the critiques of Foucault made by other ` poststructuralist ' theorists such as Michel de Certeau and Gilles Deleuze . In this area , non-representational geography and population mobility research have dominated . Others have attempted to incorporate these critiques back into the new cultural geography .

A domestic warren is an artificial , enclosed establishment of animal husbandry dedicated to the raising of rabbits for meat and fur . It evolved from the Anglo-Norman concept of free warren , which had been , essentially , the equivalent of a hunting license for a given woodland . The cunicularia of the monasteries may have more closely resembled hutches or pens , than the open enclosures with specialized structures which the domestic warren eventually became . Such an enclosure or close was called a cony-garth , or sometimes conegar , coneygree or `` bury '' ( from `` burrow '' ) . To keep the rabbits from escaping , domestic warrens were usually provided with a fairly substantive moat , or ditch filled with water . Rabbits generally do not swim and avoid water . A pale , or fence , was provided to exclude predators . The most characteristic structure of the `` cony-garth '' ( `` rabbit-yard '' ) is the pillow mound . These were `` pillow-like '' , oblong mounds with flat tops , frequently described as being `` cigar-shaped '' , and sometimes arranged like the letter or into more extensive , interconnected rows . Often these were provided with pre-built , stone-lined tunnels . The preferred orientation was on a gentle slope , with the arms extending downhill , to facilitate drainage . The soil needed to be soft , to accommodate further burrowing . See Schematic diagram of a pillow mound . This type of architecture and animal husbandry has become obsolete , but numerous pillow mounds are still to be found in Britain , some of them maintained by English Heritage . Ultimately , the term warren was generalized to include wild burrows : The word thus became used of a piece of ground preserved for these beasts of warren . It is now applied loosely to any piece of ground , whether preserved or not , where rabbits breed ( see FOREST LAWS ) . The use is further extended to any system of burrows , e.g. prairie dog warren . By 1649 the term is found applied to inferior , crowded human accommodations in the meaning `` cluster of densely populated living spaces '' ( OED ) . Contemporarily the leading use seems to be in the stock phrase `` warren of cubicles '' in the workplace .

Lamiaceae or Labiatae , also known as the mint family , is a family of flowering plants . It had traditionally been considered closely related to Verbenaceae , but in the 1990s , phylogenetic studies showed that many genera classified in Verbenaceae belong instead in Lamiaceae . The currently accepted version of Verbenaceae may not be closer to Lamiaceae than some of the other families in the order Lamiales . It is not known which of the families in Lamiales is closest to Lamiaceae . The family has a cosmopolitan distribution . The enlarged Lamiaceae contains about 236 genera and 6,900 to 7,200 species . The largest genera are Salvia ( 900 ) , Scutellaria ( 360 ) , Stachys ( 300 ) , Plectranthus ( 300 ) , Hyptis ( 280 ) , Teucrium ( 250 ) , Vitex , ( 250 ) Thymus ( 220 ) , and Nepeta ( 200 ) . Clerodendrum was once a genus of over 400 species , but by 2010 , it had been narrowed to about 150 . The plants are frequently aromatic in all parts and include many widely used culinary herbs , such as basil , mint , rosemary , sage , savory , marjoram , oregano , thyme , lavender , and perilla . Some are shrubs , trees , such as teak , or rarely vines . Many members of the family are widely cultivated , owing not only to their aromatic qualities but also their ease of cultivation : these plants are among the easiest plants to propagate by stem cuttings . Besides those grown for their edible leaves , some are grown for decorative foliage , such as coleus . Others are grown for food purposes , but seeds are utilized instead of leaves , such as with chia . The original family name is Labiatae , so given because the flowers typically have petals fused into an upper lip and a lower lip . Although this is still considered an acceptable alternative name , most botanists now use the name `` Lamiaceae '' in referring to this family . The leaves emerge oppositely , each pair at right angles to the previous one ( called decussate ) or whorled . The stems are frequently square in cross section , but this is not found in all members of the family , and is sometimes found in other plant families . The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical with 5 united petals , 5 united sepals . They are usually bisexual and verticillastrate ( a flower cluster that looks like a whorl of flowers but actually consists of two crowded clusters ) . The last revision of the entire family was published in 2004 . It described and provided keys to 236 genera . These are marked with an asterisk in the list below . A few genera have been established or resurrected since 2004 . These are marked with a plus sign . The remaining genera in the list are mostly of historical interest only and are from a source that includes such genera without explanation . Few of these are recognized in modern treatments of the family . Adelosa is a nomen dubium . No specimen exists and no one knows what Carl Ludwig Blume described as Adelosa in 1850 . Kew Gardens provides a list of genera that includes additional information and is easy to read . The list at the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website is frequently updated . The circumscription of several genera has changed since 2004 . Tsoongia , Paravitex , and Viticipremna have been sunk into synonymy with Vitex . Huxleya has been sunk into Volkameria . Kalaharia , Volkameria , Ovieda , and Tetraclea have been segregated from a formerly polyphyletic Clerodendrum . Rydingia has been separated from Leucas . The remaining Leucas is paraphyletic over four other genera . In 2004 , Lamiaceae was divided into seven subfamilies with ten genera not placed in any of the subfamilies . The unplaced genera are : Tectona , Callicarpa , Hymenopyramis , Petraeovitex , Peronema , Garrettia , Cymaria , Acrymia , Holocheila , and Ombrocharis . The subfamilies are Symphorematoideae , Viticoideae , Ajugoideae , Prostantheroideae , Nepetoideae , Scutellarioideae , and Lamioideae . The subfamily Viticoideae is probably not monophyletic . Prostantheroideae and Nepetoideae are divided into tribes . These are shown in the phylogenetic tree below . Most of the genera of Lamiaceae have never been sampled for DNA for molecular phylogenetic studies . Most of those that have been are included in the following phylogenetic tree . The phylogeny depicted below is based on seven different sources .

Vitry-sur-Seine is a commune in the southeastern suburbs of Paris , France . It is located 7.5 k from the center of Paris . Vitry-sur-Seine was originally called simply Vitry . The name Vitry comes from Medieval Latin Vitriacum , and before that Victoriacum , meaning `` estate of Victorius '' , a Gallo-Roman landowner . In 1897 the name of the commune officially became Vitry-sur-Seine ( meaning `` Vitry upon Seine '' ) , in order to distinguish it from other communes of France also called Vitry . For some years , Vitry sur Seine operated a cultural policy of bringing art to all . For this reason , the commune contains over 100 contemporary sculptures , notably in establishments of public education ( schools , secondary schools and High Schools ) . Vitry hosts the MusÃ e d'Art Contemporain du Val-de-Marne ( Val-de-Marne 's Museum of Contemporary Art ) . Opened on 18 November 2005 , this museum offers in addition to the workshops of plastic arts , an auditorium and a cinema for art and experimental film . Vitry is one of the cities that contributed to the development of the Hip hop movement in France . Consequentially , urban art has a very important place in the city Vitry-sur-Seine is served by two stations on Paris RER line C : Vitry-sur-Seine and Les Ardoines . Orly Airport is located near Vitry-sur-Seine . The city can be separated into two distinct parts , a north side containing numerous citÃ s HLM ( Housing projects ) and a south side belonging to the middle class . The bordering towns are Ivry-sur-Seine , Villejuif , Chevilly-Larue , Thiais , Choisy-le-Roi , Alfortville . In 2008 the population of the city is estimated as 82,500 inhabitants . The rate of unemployment is 29.5 % , while national average is 14 % Vitry Sur Seine is the fiftieth city the most populated of France and the tenth of Ã le-de-France .
The First Epistle of John , often referred to as First John and written 1 John , is a book of the New Testament . This fourth catholic or `` general '' epistle is attributed to John the Evangelist , traditionally thought to be the author of the Gospel of John and the other two Epistles of John . This Epistle was written in Ephesus between the years 100-110 . The work was written to counter the heresies that Jesus did not come `` in the flesh , '' but only as a spirit . It also defined how Christians are to discern true teachers : by their ethics , their proclamation of Jesus in the flesh , and by their love . The Epistle is traditionally held to have been composed by John the Evangelist , at Ephesus , when the writer was in advanced age . The epistle 's content , language and conceptual style indicate that it was composed by the same author as the Gospel of John , 2 John , and 3 John , however other modern scholars have challenged this position . arguing `` there are no concrete indications of the identity of the author ... We find here a special form of the horatory or ` paraenetic ' style ... the writer has his own locutions which give a peculiar stamp to the work ... a demonstrative is given first place in a sentence , looking forward to its definition or explanation usually after some article or conjunction ... This is one of the features which by its frequency distinguishes the style of the epistle from that of the Gospel of John ... He also ` uses the conditional sentence in a variety of rhetorical figures which are unknown to the gospel . ' '' `` The Fourth Gospel addresses itself to the challenges posed by Judaism and others outside Johannine circles who have rejected the community 's vision of Jesus as preexistent Son , sent by the Father . The epistles '' ( First , Second , and Third John ) `` describe the fracturing of the Johannine community itself . '' The author wrote the Epistle so that the joy of his audience would `` be full '' ( 1.4 ) and that they would `` sin not '' ( 2.1 ) and that `` you who believe in the name of the Son of God ... may know that you have eternal life '' ( 5.13 ) . It appears as though the author was concerned about heretical teachers that had been influencing churches under his care . Such teachers were considered Antichrists ( 2.18-19 ) who had once been church leaders but whose teaching became heterodox . It appears that these teachers taught that Jesus Christ was a Spirit being without a body ( 4.2 ) that his death on the cross was not as atonement for sins ( 1.7 ) . It appears that John might have also been rebuking a proto-Gnostic named Cerinthus , who also denied the humanity of Christ . The purpose of the author ( 1:1 -4 ) is to declare the Word of Life to those to whom he writes , in order that they might be united in fellowship with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ . He shows that the means of union with God are , ( 1 ) on the part of Christ , his atoning work ( 1:7 ; 2:2 ; 3:5 ; 4:10 , 14 ; 5:11 , 12 ) and his advocacy ( 2:1 ) ; and ( 2 ) , on the part of man , holiness ( 1:6 ) , obedience ( 2:3 ) , purity ( 3:3 ) , faith ( 3:23 ; 4:3 ; 5:5 ) , and love ( 2:7 , 8 ; 3:14 ; 4:7 ; 5:1 ) . Among the most controversial verses of the Bible is an explicit reference to what some people consider the trinity , the Comma Johanneum , ( 1 John 5:7 -8 ) . These verses do not appear in any version of the text prior to the ninth century , ( Reference ) but do appear in the King James Bible , something Isaac Newton commented on in An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture . This is sometimes used as evidence to counter the King-James-Only Movement . About the year 800 , the Comma appeared in some texts of the Latin Vulgate , and was subsequently translated into Greek and added to later Greek manuscripts . Bart Ehrman suggests in his book Misquoting Jesus that the King James Version would not have included the passage if Desiderius Erasmus had not given in to pressure to include it in the Textus Receptus even though he doubted its authenticity . The majority of modern translations ( for example English Standard Version and New American Standard Bible ) do not include this text . Albert Barnes ( 1798 â `` 1870 ) said regarding its authenticity : On the whole , therefore , the evidence seems to me to be clear that this passage is not a genuine portion of the inspired writings , and should not be appealed to in proof of the doctrine of the Trinity .
Eucrite is also a now obsolete term for bytownite-gabbro found on Earth . The term was used as a rock type name for some of the Paleogene igneous rocks of Scotland . Comet 81P\/Wild , also known as Wild 2 ( Vilt ) , is a comet named after Swiss astronomer Paul Wild , who discovered it in 1978 using a 40-cm Schmidt telescope at Zimmerwald . For most of its 4.5 billion-year lifetime , Wild 2 probably had a more distant and circular orbit . In September 1974 , it passed within one million kilometers of the planet Jupiter , whose strong gravitational pull perturbed the comet 's orbit and brought it into the inner Solar System . Its orbital period changed from 43 years to about 6 years , and its perihelion is now about 1.59 AU ( astronomical unit ) . NASA 's Stardust Mission launched a spacecraft , named Stardust , on February 7 , 1999 . It flew by Wild 2 on January 2 , 2004 , and collected particle samples from the comet 's coma , which were returned to Earth along with interstellar dust it collected during the journey . 72 close-up shots were taken of Wild 2 by Stardust . They revealed a surface riddled with flat-bottomed depressions , with sheer walls and other features that range from very small to up to 2 kilometres across . These features are believed to be caused by impact craters or gas vents . During Stardust 's flyby , at least 10 gas vents were active . The comet itself has a diameter of 5 kilometres . Stardust 's `` sample return canister , '' was reported to be in excellent condition when it landed in Utah , on January 15 , 2006 . A NASA team analyzed the particle capture cells and removed individual grains of comet and interstellar dust , then sent them to about 150 scientists around the globe . NASA is collaborating with The Planetary Society who will run a project called `` Stardust SYM Home '' , using volunteers to help locate particles on the Stardust Interstellar Dust Collector ( SIDC ) . As of 2006 , the composition of the dust has contained a wide range of organic compounds , including two that contain biologically usable nitrogen . Indigenous aliphatic hydrocarbons were found with longer chain lengths than those observed in the diffuse interstellar medium . No hydrous silicates or carbonate minerals were detected , which suggests a lack of aqueous processing of Wild 2 dust . Very few pure carbon ( CHON ) particles were found in the samples returned . A substantial amount of crystalline silicates such as olivine , anorthite and diopside were found , materials only formed at high temperature . This is consistent with previous observations of crystalline silicates both in cometary tails and in circumstellar disks at large distances from the star . Possible explanations for this high temperature material at large distances from Sun were summarised before the Stardust sample return mission by van Boekel et al . : Both in the Solar System and in circumstellar disks crystalline silicates are found at large distances from the star . The origin of these silicates is a matter of debate . Although in the hot inner-disk regions crystalline silicates can be produced by means of gas-phase condensation or thermal annealing , the typical grain temperatures in the outer-disk ( 2 â 20 au ) regions are far below the glass temperature of silicates of approx 1,000 K. The crystals in these regions may have been transported outward through the disk or in an outward-flowing wind . An alternative source of crystalline silicates in the outer disk regions is in situ annealing , for example by shocks or lightning . A third way to produce crystalline silicates is the collisional destruction of large parent bodies in which secondary processing has taken place . We can use the mineralogy of the dust to derive information about the nature of the primary and\/or secondary processes the small-grain population has undergone .
TAG Group ( Holdings ) SA is a private holding company based in Luxembourg City , in southern Luxembourg . At the head is Mansour Ojjeh son of the founder of the TAG Group Akram Ojjeh , who was a wealthy Saudi entrepreneur . TAG is an acronym of Techniques d'Avant Garde . TAG was formed in 1975 . TAG Heuer was formed as a subsidiary in 1985 when TAG bought Heuer , a renowned watchmaker specializing in racing chronographs . Together they modernized the product line and became one of the biggest names in Swiss watches .

Streptococcus is a genus of spherical Gram-positive bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes and the lactic acid bacteria group . Cellular division occurs along a single axis in these bacteria , and thus they grow in chains or pairs , hence the name -- from Greek Ï Ï Ï Î Ï Ï Î Ï streptos , meaning easily bent or twisted , like a chain ( twisted chain ) . Contrast this with staphylococci , which divide along multiple axes and generate grape-like clusters of cells . Streptococci are oxidase - and catalase-negative , and many are facultative anaerobes . In 1984 , many organisms formerly considered Streptococcus were separated out into the genera Enterococcus and Lactococcus . In addition to streptococcal pharyngitis ( or strep throat ) , certain Streptococcus species are responsible for many cases of meningitis , bacterial pneumonia , endocarditis , erysipelas and necrotizing fasciitis ( the ` flesh-eating ' bacterial infections ) . However , many streptococcal species are non-pathogenic . Indeed , Streptococci are a necessary ingredient in Emmentaler ( `` Swiss '' ) cheese . Streptococci are also part of the normal commensal microbiome of the mouth , skin , intestine , and upper respiratory tract of humans . As a rule , individual species of Streptococcus are classified based on their hemolytic properties . Alpha hemolysis is caused by an oxidation of iron in hemoglobin , giving it a greenish color on blood agar . Beta-hemolysis is complete rupture of red blood cells , giving distinct , wide , clear areas around bacterial colonies on blood agar . Other streptococci are labeled as gamma hemolytic , actually a misnomer , as no hemolysis takes place . In the medical setting , the most important groups are the alpha-hemolytic streptococci , S. pneumoniae and Streptococcus Viridans-group , and the beta-hemolytic streptococci of Lancefield groups A and B ( also known as â Group A strepâ and â Group B strepâ ) . Beta-hemolytic streptococci are further characterised via the Lancefield serotyping â `` based on specific carbohydrates in the bacterial cell wall . These are named Lancefield groups A to v ( except I and J ) . S. pyogenes , also known as Group A Streptococcus ( GAS ) , is the causative agent in Group A streptococcal infections , including streptococcal pharyngitis ( `` strep throat '' AmE ) , acute rheumatic fever , scarlet fever , acute glomerulonephritis and necrotizing fasciitis . Other Streptococcus species may also possess the Group A antigen , but human infections by non-S . pyogenes GAS strains ( some S. dysgalactiae subsp . equisimilis and S. anginosus Group strains ) appear to be uncommon . Group A Streptococcus infection is generally diagnosed with a Rapid Strep Test ( AmE ) or by culture . Rheumatic fever , a disease that affects the joints and heart valves , is a consequence of untreated strep A infection caused not by the bacterium itself . Rheumatic fever is caused by the antibodies created by the immune system to fight off the infection cross-reacting with other proteins in the body . This cross-reaction causes the body to essentially attack itself and leads to the damage above . S. agalactiae , or GBS , causes pneumonia and meningitis in neonates and the elderly , with occasional systemic bacteremia . They can also colonize the intestines and the female reproductive tract , increasing the risk for premature rupture of membranes and transmission to the infant . The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control recommend all pregnant women between 35 and 37 weeks gestation should be tested for GBS . Women who test positive should be given prophylactic antibiotics during labor , which will usually prevent transmission to the infant . In the UK , clinicians have been slow to implement the same standards as the US , Australia and Canada . In the UK , only 1 % of maternity units test for the presence of Group B Streptococcus . Although The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists issued risk-based guidelines in 2003 ( due for review 2006 ) , the implementation of these guidelines has been patchy . Some groups feel that as a result over 75 infants in the UK die each year of GBS related disease and another 600 or so suffer serious infection , most of which could be prevented however this is yet to be substantiated by randomized controlled trial in the UK setting and , given the evidence for the efficacy of testing and treating from other countries , it may be that the large-scale trial necessary would receive neither funding nor ethics approval . Includes S. equi , which causes strangles in horses , and S. zooepidemicus - S. equi is a clonal descendent or biovar of the ancestral S. zooepidemicus - which causes infections in several species of mammals including cattle and horses . These streptococci are usually but not exclusively beta hemolytic . Streptococcus canis is an example of a GGS which is typically found on animals but can cause infection in humans . Many former Group D streptococci have been reclassified and placed in the genus Enterococcus ( including S. faecalis , S. faecium , S. durans , and S. avium ) . For example , Streptococcus faecalis is now Enterococcus faecalis . The remaining non-enterococcal Group D strains include Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus equinus . Non-hemolytic streptococci rarely cause illness . However , weakly hemolytic group D beta-hemolytic streptococci and Listeria monocytogenes ( which is actually a gram positive bacillus ) should not be confused with non-hemolytic streptococci .
Christoph Daum ( born 24 October 1953 in Zwickau ) is a German football coach . Daum began his football career in 1971 in the youth league with Hamborn 07 , transferred in 1972 to Eintracht Duisburg and then in 1975 to 1 . FC KÃ ln , where he played in the amateur league . After finishing his career as a player , he earned his coaching licence at the DFB and began working in 1981 as amateur coach with 1 . FC KÃ ln . In the 1985\/86 season he was promoted to assistant coach and in 1986 to the top position . During the 1990 FIFA World Cup , Daum was released from his position by Cologne 's president Dietmar Artzinger-Bolten . In November 1990 he transferred to VfB Stuttgart , where he won the German championship in 1992 . In the following season Daum committed a mistake in the first round of the European Cup against Leeds United on 30 September 1992 by illegally putting in a fourth foreign player . A replay was scheduled , which Leeds won . The UK newspaper ` The Sun ' dubbed him ` Christoph Dumb ' following this incident . The VfB missed out on the Champions League and Daum was released . Beginning in 1994 Daum worked with the Turkish club BeÅ iktaÅ J.K. in Istanbul . He won the Turkish league championship title with BeÅ iktaÅ J.K. in the 1994 â `` 95 season . In the 1995 â `` 96 season he was sacked after losses to Kocaelispor and Vanspor . Daum returned to Germany two years later to coach Bayer Leverkusen in 1996 . He was very successful at Bayer Leverkusen , winning 3 second places in Bundesliga in four years of coaching . Following the 2000 UEFA European Football Championship Daum was tipped to become head coach of the German national team . The press reported rumors that Daum engaged in cocaine-fuelled orgies with prostitutes . Daum threatened the press and gave hair samples to the authorities to convince everybody about his innocence . The samples showed that he was a cocaine user but he told the press that the hairs were not his . However , one year later , facing the prospect of jail time , Daum admitted he had used cocaine . Meanwhile , his agreement to become national team coach was annulled by the German Football Association on 21 October 2000 and Rudi VÃ ller was given the job . As a result of the so-called Daum-Affair he was fired from Bayer Leverkusen and was unable to find a club to work with in Germany . While he was still on trial in Germany , he returned to his former team BeÅ iktaÅ from March 2001 to May 2002 . Afterwards , he moved to FK Austria Wien in October 2002 , where he won another league championship title . Beginning in July 2003 , he was head coach at FenerbahÃ e. Daum won two consecutive Turkish league championships in 2004 and 2005 . While his failure to succeed in the Champions League was often criticized in the Turkish media , the improvements in FenerbahÃ e under his management were significant . At the end of the 2005 â `` 06 season FenerbahÃ e lost the national championship to their arch-rival Galatasaray on the final week of the league , after which Daum resigned . Daum signed for 1 . FC KÃ ln on 27 November 2006 . The contract ran until 2010 . KÃ ln returned to Bundesliga after finishing 3rd in Second Bundesliga in 2007 â `` 08 season . Daum left the club on 1 June 2009 . Daum signed a three-year contract for FenerbahÃ e S.K. on 2 June 2009 On 25 June 2010 FenerbahÃ e S.K. parted ways with him . On 22 March 2011 , it was confirmed that Daum has signed a contract with Eintracht Frankfurt as coach after the club has sacked Michael Skibbe following a decline in the Bundesliga in the second half season .

7066 Nessus ( ; from ) is a centaur ( a type of icy planetoid ) that was discovered by David L. Rabinowitz , working with Spacewatch , at Kitt Peak on 26 April 1993 . It was the second centaur found by him ( 5145 Pholus being his previous find ) , and the third centaur discovery ( 2060 Chiron was the first ) . It was officially announced on May 13 , 1993 , in IAUC 5789 with designation . 7066 Nessus has an orbital period of 122.4 years , an eccentricity of 0.52 and an inclination to the ecliptic of 15.6 degrees . At perihelion , it moves much closer to the Sun than Uranus , while at aphelion it moves out well beyond the orbit of Neptune . The orbits of centaurs are unstable due to perturbations by the giant planets . Nessus is a SE object since currently Saturn controls the perihelion and the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt controls the aphelion . Nessus is estimated to have a relatively long orbital half-life of about 4.9 Myr . Fifty clones of the orbit of Nessus suggest that Nessus will not pass within 1AU ( 150Gm ) of a planet for at least twenty thousand years . The naming of Nessus is an interesting break from tradition . Three astrologers were independently studying to see if it had any astrological significance . These were Zane B. Stein in the USA , and Dieter Koch and Robert Von Heeren in Germany . In separate letters to astronomers David L. Rabinowitz , Alan Stern , Jim Scotti and Dr. Brian Marsden , these astrologers suggested naming the body after the mythological centaur Nessus . Dr. Marsden gave his support to the suggested name , and recommended it to the IAU . This name was approved , and was officially renamed 7066 Nessus on April 22 , 1997 . This naming was an unprecedented cooperation between astrologers and astronomers .
La Garnache is a commune in the VendÃ e department in the Pays de la Loire department in the Pays de la Loire region in western France .
Photorespiration , or '' ` photo-respiration ' '' , is a process in plant metabolism by which RuBP ( a sugar ) has oxygen added to it by the enzyme ( rubisco ) , instead of carbon dioxide during normal photosynthesis . This process reduces efficiency of photosynthesis in C3 plants . Rubisco favors carbon dioxide as a ligand to oxygen , however , photorespiration occurs when there is a high concentration of oxygen relative to carbon dioxide . The first reaction produces phosphoglycerate and phosphoglycolate ( PPG ) , PGA re-enters the Calvin cycle and is simply converted back to RuBP . PPG , however , is more difficult to recycle and has to move from the chloroplast to the peroxisomes , and then to the mitochondria , undergoing many reactions on the way , before the atoms can return into the Calvin cycle . Photorespiration can occur when carbon dioxide levels are low , for example , when the stomata are closed to prevent water loss during drought . In most plants , photorespiration increases as temperature increases . Photorespiration produces no ATP and leads to a net loss of carbon and nitrogen ( as ammonia ) , slowing plant growth . Potential photosynthetic output may be reduced by photorespiration by up to 25 % in C3 plants . However , reduction in photorespiration may not result in increasing growth rates for plants . Some research has suggested , for example , that photorespiration may be necessary for the assimilation of nitrate from soil . Thus , a reduction in photorespiration by genetic engineering or because of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide due to fossil fuel burning may not benefit plants as has been proposed . The phosphoglycolate is salvaged by a series of reactions in the peroxisome , mitochondria , and again in the peroxisome where it is converted into serine and later glycerate . Glycerate reenters the chloroplast and , subsequently , the Calvin cycle by the same transporter that exports glycolate . A cost of 1 ATP is associated with conversion to 3-phosphoglycerate ( PGA ) ( Phosphorylation ) , within the chloroplast , which is then free to reenter the Calvin cycle . One carbon dioxide molecule is produced for every 2 molecules of O2 that are taken up by RuBisCO . Photorespiration is a wasteful process because G3P is created at a reduced rate and higher metabolic cost ( 2ATP and one NAD ( P ) H ) compared with RuBP carboxylase activity . G3P produced in the chloroplast is used to create `` nearly all '' of the food and structures in the plant . While photorespiratory carbon cycling results in the formation of G3P eventually , it also produces waste ammonia that must be detoxified at a substantial cost to the cell in ATP and reducing equivalents . Photorespiration is said to be an evolutionary relic . Photorespiration lowers the efficiency of photosynthesis by removing carbon molecules from the Calvin Cycle . The early atmosphere in which primitive plants originated contained very little oxygen , so it is hypothesized that the early evolution of RuBisCO was not influenced by its lack of discrimination between O2 and carbon dioxide . Although the functions of photorespiration remain controversial , it is widely accepted that this pathway influences a wide range of processes from bioenergetics , photosystem II function , and carbon metabolism to nitrogen assimilation and respiration . The photorespiratory pathway is a major source of H2O2 in photosynthetic cells . Through H2O2 production and pyridine nucleotide interactions , photorespiration makes a key contribution to cellular redox homeostasis . In so doing , it influences multiple signaling pathways , in particular , those that govern plant hormonal responses controlling growth , environmental and defense responses , and programmed cell death . Another theory postulates that it may function as a `` safety valve '' , preventing excess NADPH and ATP from reacting with oxygen and producing free radicals , as these can damage the metabolic functions of the cell by subsequent reactions with lipids or metabolites of alternate pathways . Since photorespiration requires additional energy from the light reactions of photosynthesis , some plants have mechanisms to reduce uptake of molecular oxygen by RuBisCO . They increase the concentration of CO2 in the leaves so that Rubisco is less likely to produce glycolate through reaction with O2 . C4 plants capture carbon dioxide in cells of their mesophyll ( using an enzyme called PEP carboxylase ) , and oxaloacetate is formed . This oxaloacetate is then converted to malate and is released into the bundle sheath cells ( site of carbon dioxide fixation by RuBisCO ) where oxygen concentration is low to avoid photorespiration . Here , carbon dioxide is removed from the malate and combined with RuBP in the usual way , and the Calvin cycle proceeds as normal . This ability to avoid photorespiration makes these plants more hardy than other plants in dry and hot environments , wherein stomata are closed and internal carbon dioxide levels are low . C4 plants include sugar cane , corn ( maize ) , and sorghum . CAM plants , such as cacti and succulent plants , use the enzyme PEP carboxylase ( which catalyzes the combination of carbon dioxide with a compound called Phosphoenolpyruvate or PEP ) in a mechanism called Crassulacean acid metabolism , or CAM , in which PEP carboxylase sequesters carbon at night and releases it to the photosynthesizing cells during the day . This provides a mechanism for reducing high rates of water loss ( transpiration ) by stomata during the day .
Takuya Takagi is a former Japanese football ( soccer ) player and a current football coach . He is currently the manager at Roasso Kumamoto . He was a physical forward and the Japanese media and fans dubbed him as the Cannon of Asia . He was educated at and played for Kunimi High School and Osaka University of Commerce . After finishing the university in 1990 , he joined Japan Soccer League side Fujita S.C. ( current Shonan Bellmare ) . He moved to Mazda S.C. ( current Sanfrecce Hiroshima ) in 1991 and was awarded the JSL Young Player of the Year in 1992 . His partnarship with Czech Ivan HaÅ ek up front was so successful that Hiroshima won the second stage of J. League in 1994 . Due to financial difficulties , Hiroshima was forced to release their key players including Takagi in 1998 . He moved to Verdy Kawasaki . He was then transferred to J. League Division 2 side Consadole Sapporo in 2000 and retired there at the end of the season . He was capped 44 times and scored 27 goals for the Japanese national team . He made his international debut in a friendly against Argentine on May 31 , 1992 at the Tokyo National Olympic Stadium , the first match under Hans Ooft 's reign . He scored his first international goal in a Dynasty Cup match against China national football team on August 24 , 1992 in Beijing . He became the ace striker for Ooft 's Japan national team . He was a member of the Japan team that won the 1992 AFC Asian Cup . He scored the lone goal in the final against Saudi Arabia and even though he is said to be awarded the Most Valuable Player of the competition , this is not true . The honor went to his team mate Kazuyoshi Miura . Takagi was n't even elected into the Tournament Best Eleven . He was also a member of the Japan squad who participated in the AFC final qualifying stage for the 1994 FIFA World Cup . He was suspended for the crucial last match that the Japanese fans now refer to as the Agony of Doha , and watched from the bench a late Iraqi equaliser dashed Japan 's hope to qualify for the finals in the U.S.A. He also took part in the 1996 AFC Asian Cup hosted by UAE . He played 3 games and scored 1 goal against Syria in the competition . After finishing his playing career , he worked as a soccer commentator on television . He also acquired the S-Class Coaching License that was a prerequisite to manage a J. league club in 2004 . At the beginning of 2006 , he was appointed an assistant coach at Yokohama FC . He was unexpectedly promoted to the manager of the club to replace Yusuke Adachi who was sacked only after the team lost to Ehime F.C. in the opening match of the season . Takagi 's lack of coaching experience and untimely dismissal of Adachi worried the fans who decided in protest to watch the second match of the season ( the first match under Takagi ) in silence . However , Takagi quickly convinced the supporters as he guided the club unbeaten for the first fifteen matches under his reign . This was the record unbeaten run since appointment of a new manager in J. League . The club made another J. League record when they did not concede any goal for 770 consecutive minutes by breaking Shimizu S-Pulse 's 731 minutes recorded in 1993 . They kept 7 consecutive clean sheets which was also a tied J. League Division 2 record . Yokohama FC , who had been languishing in the bottom half of the standing previous 5 seasons since their accession to J2 , won the title and gained the first-ever promotion to J. League Division 1 . The club made a drastic change in their squad before the beginning of the 2007 season in preparation for the fight in the top-flight . Eleven players left while another eleven joined the club . Those who left included the striking partners Shoji Jo and AlemÃ # o who scored 30 goals together out of club 's 61 goals in the previous season . Long-serving Tomotaka Kitamura and Tsuyoshi Yoshitake also left . Takagi enhanced his squad by recruiting former Japanese internationals Tatsuhiko Kubo and Daisuke Oku ( both from Yokohama F. Marinos ) , and Silva ( from Tokyo Verdy ) . They beat Marinos in a Yokohama derby in the second match of the season , but otherwise the things did n't go well for Takagi . New team leaders Oku and Kubo were sidelined due to injuries and the club was anchored at the bottom of the standing . The club signed high-profile former Japanese international midfielder Atsuhiro Miura in August . Apparently there was a conflict between the management and Takagi as he expressed disgruntlement on Miura 's signing quoting that what the club needed at that point was a good defender or forward . He was sacked on August 27 , 2007 and replaced by Brazilian Julio Cesar leal Junior . He became a coach at Tokyo Verdy under manager and his former international team mate Tetsuji Hashiratani . He was promoted to the manager of the Verdy in 2009 . He was appointed the manager of Roasso Kumamoto in 2010 .

He achieved his last ten victories in September when he reached his final score of 44 . Shortly before the armistice , he was promoted to Hauptmann ( captain ) . Loerzer illegally fought with the Freikorps from December 1918 until March 1920 , helping to create an atmosphere of chaos and lawlessness in Germany . He commanded FA 427 in the Baltic area , supporting the Eiserne Division in the tactical air role . During the 1930s he was a leader in various civil aviation organizations ( National Socialist Flying Corps : NSFK ) , and commanded fighter unit JG 334 ` Pik As ' when the Luftwaffe was organized . Loerzer benefited from his long friendship with GÃ ring , becoming a major general in 1938 . During the early war years he was commander of II Fliegerkorps ( Air Corps ) , being awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) in May 1940 . His II Air Corps participated in the invasion of Russia in the summer of 1941 , as a section of Kesselring 's 2nd Air Fleet -- in support of Fieldmarshall von Bock . His unit was transferred to Messina , Sicily in October 1941 , and he remained there until the middle of 1943 , when his section returned to the Italian mainland . GÃ ring promoted Loerzer to Generaloberst in February 1943 and in June 1944 was chief of the National Socialist Leadership Branch of the Luftwaffe . He retired in April 1945 . Loerzer died in 1960 , at the age of 69 .
Edward John `` Ted '' Phillips ( born 21 August 1933 in Leiston , Suffolk ) was an English professional footballer . He made over 250 appearances for Ipswich Town from 1953 to 1964 , almost all of them under Alf Ramsey , scoring over 150 goals making him the second highest scorer in the club 's history .

'' He also represented Luton Town , Leyton Orient and Colchester United in his twelve-year career . He coached Maltese club Floriana Football Club during the season 1966 â `` 67 . Phillips recently appeared on the Sky Sports program Time of Our Lives , along with former Ipswich clubmates Larry Carberry and Ray Crawford , where they reminisced about their footballing days . On the show , Phillips revealed that in 1974 he met former boss Ramsey by chance and they spent the evening socialising . The following morning Phillips opened the front page of a newspaper and was stunned to read that Ramsey had been sacked as England manager . His shock came from the fact Ramsey already knew he was no longer in charge of England when they were together that evening and did n't mention it once .

Veronica Guerin ( 5 July 1958 - 26 June 1996 ) was an Irish crime reporter who was murdered on 26 June 1996 by drug lords , an event , which alongside the murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe three weeks earlier , helped establish the Criminal Assets Bureau . Veronica Guerin , nicknamed `` Ronnie '' , and her four siblings were born in Dublin and attended Catholic school where she excelled in athletics . Besides basketball and football , she was a camogie player and a fan of the Manchester United football team . Veronica Guerin 's father was an accountant , and she studied accountancy at Trinity College , Dublin . After graduation , her father hired her at his company . When her father died three years later , she changed professions and started a public relations firm , which she ran for seven years . In 1983-4 , she served as secretary to the Fianna FÃ il group at the New Ireland Forum . In 1990 , she changed careers again , switching to journalism as a reporter with the Sunday Business Post and Sunday Tribune . In 1994 , she began to write about criminals for Irish newspaper the Sunday Independent . She used street names or pseudonyms for underworld figures to avoid Irish libel laws . When she began to cover drug dealers , she received numerous death threats . The first violence against her occurred in October , 1994 when two shots were fired into her home after her story on a murdered drug kingpin was published . Guerin dismissed the `` warning '' . Three months later , she answered her doorbell to a man pointing a revolver at her head . The assailant shot her in the leg . Regardless , she vowed to continue her investigations . Independent Newspapers installed a security system to protect her , and the Garda SÃ ochÃ na ( Irish police ) gave her a 24-hour escort ; however , she did not approve of this , saying that it hampered her work . On 13 September 1995 , convicted criminal John Gilligan attacked her when she confronted him about his lavish lifestyle with no source of income . He later called her at home and threatened to kidnap and rape her son and kill her if she wrote anything about him . Guerin received the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists in December , 1995 . On 26 June 1996 , while Guerin was driving her red Opel Calibra she stopped at a traffic light on the Naas Dual Carriageway near Newlands Cross , on the outskirts of Dublin , not knowing she was being followed by a motorbike . One of two men sitting on the motorbike shot her six times with a .357 Magnum revolver , killing her . The murder weapon has never been recovered . Guerin 's murder caused outrage , and Taoiseach John Bruton called it `` an attack on democracy '' . In the wake of Guerin 's death , the Oireachtas , the Irish parliament , realized the potential of using tax enforcement laws as a means of deterring and punishing criminals . It then enacted the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 , so that assets purchased with money obtained through crime could be seized by the government . This led to the formation of the Criminal Assets Bureau ( CAB ) . In 1997 a Garda witness in court named Patrick ` Dutchy ' Holland as the man suspected of shooting Guerin . Holland was a former US Marine , though he was from Dublin . He was never convicted of the murder and he denied the accusation up until his death in June 2009 while in prison in the UK . In November 1998 , Dublin drug lord Paul Ward was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison as an accomplice because he had disposed of the murder weapon and the motorbike . This conviction was later overturned on appeal , though Ward continues to serve a long prison sentence for his participation in a prison riot . Brian Meehan , a major Dublin drug lord who fled to Amsterdam , was extradited to Ireland in late 1997 , where he was convicted of murdering Guerin and sentenced to life imprisonment . John Gilligan , who left Ireland the day before Guerin was murdered , was extradited from the United Kingdom on 3 February 2000 . He was tried and acquitted of her murder but convicted of importing cannabis and sentenced to 28 years in prison ; this was reduced to 20 years on appeal . To aid in these prosecutions the first ever Witness Protection Programme in Ireland was created . In January 2008 , Gilligan made a court appearance in an attempt to stop the State from selling off his assets . He accused John Traynor of having ordered Guerin 's murder without his permission . Despite the presiding judge 's attempt to silence Gilligan , he continued to blame a botched GardaÃ investigation and planted evidence as the reason for his current imprisonment . Traynor had been Guerin 's confidential source during the inquiry into drug trafficking which led to her assassination . Traynor fled Europe after Guerin 's murder , having been on the run since 1992 . In 2010 , he was finally arrested in Amsterdam , Holland ; he is set to be extradited back to the UK .
Christopher Roy Oddleifson ( born September 7 , 1950 in Brandon , Manitoba ) is a retired professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League from 1972 until 1981 . He is best known for his time with the Vancouver Canucks , where he was one of the team 's top players for much of the 1970s and served as team captain in 1976 â `` 77 . Oddleifson was selected 10th overall in the 1970 NHL Amateur Draft by the California Golden Seals following a dominant final junior season with the Winnipeg Jets of the WCHL , during which he finished with 95 points ( including a league-leading 64 assists ) and 243 penalty minutes . However , he was assigned to the minors and would never play an NHL game for the Seals , and was dealt to the Boston Bruins mid-way through the 1971 â `` 72 season . In 1972 â `` 73 , Oddleifson finally made his NHL debut , appearing in 6 games for Boston without recording a point . He managed to crack the Bruins full-time in 1974 â `` 75 and acquitted himself well , highlighted by a four-goal game against the Golden Seals , the team that had given up on him two years earlier . Late in the season , he was dealt to the Vancouver Canucks in a deal for sniper Bobby Schmautz , and he finished out his rookie season with decent totals of 13 goals and 29 points in 70 games between Boston and Vancouver . Oddleifson would have his breakout year in 1974 â `` 75 , as he emerged as a leader on a young Canuck team which surprised by winning their division and making the playoffs for the first time in franchise history . He proved himself to be an exceptional all-around player who possessed size , toughness , and playmaking ability , as well as the ability to play both at center and on the wing . He led the Canucks in scoring through the early part of the season , until a fractured jaw forced him to miss 20 games . Nevertheless , he finished with career highs of 16 goals and 35 assists for 51 points in just 60 games . In 1975 â `` 76 , Oddleifson would have his finest NHL season , as he notched 16 goals and a club-leading 46 assists for a career high 62 points . Although his production waned somewhat in the next few seasons , he remained one of the team 's top all-around forwards and most popular players . He was named team captain for 1976 â `` 77 , although he was replaced by Don Lever the following year . In 1977 â `` 78 , he recorded a career-high 17 goals for the club . By the 1979 â `` 80 season , the emergence of young stars like Thomas Gradin , Stan Smyl and Curt Fraser , as well as the acquisition of several skilled veterans , had pushed Oddleifson into a mainly defensive role , and he finished the season with career lows of just 8 goals and 28 points . Early in the 1980 â `` 81 campaign , he was assigned to the Dallas Black Hawks , effectively ending his NHL career . Oddleifson spent two more seasons playing in Switzerland before retiring in 1983 . He finished his NHL career with totals 95 goals and 191 assists for 286 points in 524 games , along with 464 penalty minutes . Following his career , Oddleifson returned to Vancouver and became a successful real estate agent . He remains active with the Canuck Oldtimers squad .
The Ford Kuga is a compact crossover SUV designed and produced by Ford . The car is based on the C1 platform that also form the underpinnings of the Ford Focus and Ford C-MAX . Both front-wheel drive and four-wheel drive are offered , each with a choice of 2.5-litre petrol or 2.0-litre diesel engine . The Kuga went on sale in the first half of 2008 , and is built at Ford 's plant in Saarlouis , Germany . In the UK , emphasising the car 's premium market aspirations , only high-end Zetec and Titanium specifications are offered . It is similarly priced to the other small SUVs in the market such as the Citroen C-Crosser\/Peugeot 4007 and the Vauxhall\/Opel Antara , and is on sale in the UK with a starting price of around Â # 20,500 . The combined fuel consumption is 44.1 m and the CO2 emissions is 169 g\/km . On July 20 , 2007 , a report indicated that Ford executives were considering the prospects of sales in North America . This idea was later scrapped after it was determined the car could not be sold both competitively priced and at a profit in the US due to the current dollar-Euro exchange rate . On July 24 , 2008 , WDIV-TV had announced that Ford is re-considering bringing the Kuga to North America after all . On October 22 , 2009 , news leaked that Ford will build the Kuga at its Louisville plant , possibly as the 2012 Ford Escape . On June 23 , 2010 , it was announced that Ford will end production on the second generation Escape in 2011 in anticipation to the Kuga 's North American launch as the next-generation Escape . The Ford Kuga is now also available in Argentina since 2010 . It is assembled in Ford Argentina 's General Pacheco Plant . A facelift will be released in late 2010 . That redesigned Kuga will form the basis for the 2013 Ford Escape sold in the U.S. Both vehicles will likely offer a hybrid option , as Ford announced in May 2010 that it would build unspecified hybrids at a plant in Valencia , Spain . If built , the Kuga Hybrid would be Ford 's first hybrid to be sold in Europe , though it has sold over 100,000 Escape Hybrids and Mercury Mariner Hybrids in the U.S. since 2004 .
Spin is a music magazine founded in 1985 by publisher Bob Guccione Jr. . In its early years , the magazine was noted for its broad music coverage with an emphasis on college-oriented rock music and on the ongoing emergence of hip-hop . The magazine was eclectic and bold , if sometimes haphazard . It pointedly provided a national alternative to the Rolling Stone 's more establishment-oriented style . Spin prominently placed newer artists such as R.E.M. , Prince , Run-D.M.C. , Eurythmics , Beastie Boys , and Talking Heads , on its covers and did lengthy features on established figures such as Bob Dylan , Keith Richards , Miles Davis , Aerosmith , Lou Reed , Tom Waits , and John Lee Hookerâ '' Bart Bull 's article on Hooker won the magazine its first major award . Putting black artists and women artists on the cover was considered a risk , potentially damaging newsstand sales . Moreover , the magazine devoted itself to a long term set of investigative pieces on the AIDS crisis at a time when even gay publications were concerned about losing advertisers by doing coverage of the disease . On a cultural level , the magazine devoted significant coverage to hardcore punk , alternative country , reggae and world music , experimental rock , jazz of the most adventurous sort , the burgeoning college rock and underground music scenes of the 1980s , and a variety of fringe styles . Artists such as The Ramones , Patti Smith , Blondie , X , Black Flag , and the former members of The Sex Pistols , The Clash , and the early punk\/new wave movement were cultural heritage pioneers in Spin 's editorial mix , and were reviewed , featured , and mentioned constantly at a time when Rolling Stone and other publications scarcely acknowledged their existence . Spin 's extensive coverage of hip-hop music and culture , especially that of contributing editor John Leland , was notable at a time when no other national publication was paying serious attention to the genre . . Editorial contributions by musical and cultural figures such as Lydia Lunch , Henry Rollins , David Lee Roth , Dwight Yoakam , and others were an innovation at the time . The magazine also did scene reports on cities such as Austin , Texas , or Glasgow , Scotland , at times when they were unrecognized as cultural incubators . A 1990 article on the contemporary country blues scene brought R. L. Burnside to national attention for the first time . Coverage of American cartoonists , Japanese manga , monster trucks , outsider artists , Twin Peaks , and other non-mainstream cultural phenomena distinguished the magazine 's dynamic early years . In late 1987 , publisher Bob Guccione Jr. 's father , Bob Guccione Sr. , abruptly shut the magazine down despite the fact that the 2-year-old magazine was widely considered a success , with a newsstand circulation of 150,000 . Guccione Jr. was able to rally much of his staff , locate new investors and offices , and after missing a month 's publication , returned with a combined Novemberâ `` December issue . During this time it was published by Camouflage Associates . Guccione sold the magazine to Miller Publishing in 1997 . In February 2006 , Miller Publishing sold the magazine for less than US$ 5 million to a San Francisco-based company called the McEvoy Group LLC , which was also the owner of Chronicle Books . That company formed Spin Media LLC as a holding company . The new owners replaced editor-in-chief ( since 2002 ) Sia Michel with Andy Pemberton , a former editor at Blender . The first issue to be published under his brief command was the July 2006 issueâ '' sent to the printer in May 2006 â '' which featured BeyoncÃ on the cover . Pemberton and Spin parted ways the next month , in June 2006 . The current editor , Doug Brod , was executive editor during Michel 's tenure . For Spin 's 20th year , it released a book chronicling the last two decades in music . The book has essays on Britpop , grunge , emo , and many other types of music , as well as pieces on musical acts including Marilyn Manson , Nirvana , Weezer , Nine Inch Nails , Limp Bizkit , and The Smashing Pumpkins . In February 2008 , Spin released a digital edition available through Texterity . Notable contributors have included Barry Michael Cooper , Dave Eggers , Chuck Klosterman , Byron Coley , Kim France , Tad Friend , Elizabeth Gilbert , Andy Greenwald , William T. Vollman , Will Hermes , Dave Itzkoff , David Bourgeois , John Leland , Bart Bull , Greil Marcus , Matt Groening , Glenn O'Brien , Norman Mailer , R. Meltzer , Karen Schoemer , Marilyn Manson , William S. Burroughs , Anton Corbijn , Bob Gruen , Roberta Bayley , Jon Dolan , Rob Tannenbaum , Jonathan Ames , Strawberry Saroyan , Paul Beahan ( founder of Manimal Vinyl ) , Michael O'Donoghue , BÃ nz Malone , Dan Ackerman , and Marc Spitz .

Canada Dry is a brand of soft drinks owned since 2008 by the Texas-based Dr Pepper Snapple Group . For over a century Canada Dry has been known for its ginger ale , though the company also manufactures a number of other soft drinks and mixers . Although Canada Dry originated in its namesake country , it is now produced in many countries around the globe , including the United States , the Middle East , Europe and Japan . In 1890 , Canadian pharmacist and chemist , John J. McLaughlin of Enniskillen , Ontario opened a carbonated water plant in Toronto . McLaughlin was the oldest son of Robert McLaughlin , founder of McLaughlin Carriage and McLaughlin Motor Car . In 1904 , McLaughlin created Canada Dry Pale Ginger Ale ; three years later the drink was appointed to the Royal Household of the Governor General of Canada , and the label featuring a beaver atop a map of Canada was replaced with the present Crown and shield . When McLaughlin began shipping his product to New York in 1919 , it became so popular that he opened a plant in Manhattan shortly thereafter . After McLaughlin 's death , the company was run briefly by Sam . P. D. Saylor and Associates who bought the business from the McLaughlin family in 1923 and formed Canada Dry Ginger Ale , Inc. , a public company . Canada Dry 's popularity as a mixer began during Prohibition , when its flavor helped mask the taste of homemade liquor . In the 1930s , Canada Dry expanded worldwide , and from the 1950s onward , the company introduced a larger number of products . Norton Simon took an interest in the company in 1964 , and it merged with Simon 's other holdings , the McCall Corporation and Hunt Foods , to form Norton Simon Inc. . Dr Pepper bought Canada Dry from Norton Simon in 1982 . In 1984 , Dr Pepper was acquired by Forstmann Little & Company , and Canada Dry was sold to R. J. Reynolds ' Del Monte Foods unit to pay off acquisition debt . RJR Nabisco sold its soft drink business to Cadbury Schweppes in 1986 . Today , Canada Dry is owned by Dr Pepper Snapple Group , which spun out of Cadbury Schweppes in 2008 . Among its many other meanings , the word `` dry '' can mean `` not sweet '' , as in a dry wine . When John McLaughlin originally formulated his new soft drink , it was far less sweet than other ginger ales then available ; as a result , he labeled it `` dry '' . Limited availability flavors are produced in Pennsauken Township , New Jersey by Pepsi-Cola\/National Brand Beverages , and are distributed in southern New Jersey , Delaware , southeastern Pennsylvania , and eastern Maryland . At one time the flavors all had uniquely designed labels , but now all use the standard Canada Dry crest logo .
Paul Anthony Cook ( born 22 February 1967 in Liverpool ) is an English former footballer , currently manager of Sligo Rovers in Ireland . He had a lengthy career , playing for a number of clubs in the Football League as a left sided or central midfielder before retiring from the game in 2006 . Cook began his career at his local non-league team Marine before being quickly signed up by Wigan Athletic , where he featured in almost one hundred games in a four-year spell . Cook then had a brief and unsuccessful spell at Norwich City before moving to the Midlands to play for Wolves for Â # 250,000 . He was a very popular player during his time at Wolves , both with the fans and his team-mates and became known for his deadly and accurate left foot . After over 190 appearances for Wolves over five seasons in the second tier , he made the short journey to Premier League Coventry City . He played the majority of the club 's games in his first season ( 1994-95 ) but fell from favor during the following campaign , where he made only three appearances . In February 1996 , he was sold to Tranmere Rovers for Â # 250,000 . Whilst at Tranmere he became a key member of the team , playing sixty games in just eighteen months . In October 1997 , Tranmere accepted a bid of Â # 250,000 from Stockport County and so regained the fee they had paid for Cook in the first place . After twelve months at County , Cook began to be regarded as ` too old ' , despite being just 32 . This led to his move to Burnley , initially on loan but fully signing in July 1999 to play under Stan Ternent . Cook experienced an ` Indian summer ' to his career , making 130 league appearances over a four year spell . During this period he established excellent understandings with many players , especially Lee Briscoe and the two often devised new free-kick routines to catch Division One defences off-guard . After a falling out with the manager , Cook went on loan to one of his old clubs , Wigan Athletic , but made just six appearances before he was re-called to again take his place in the starting line up at Turf Moor . Cook left Burnley at the end of the 2003 season , at the same time as Andy Payton . The two players got a standing ovation from the fans for their contributions to the club . Defying doubts about his fitness and age , Cook signed for non-league team Accrington Stanley and went on to become a first team regular in their push for promotion to the Football League . This target was finally achieved in the 2005\/06 season when Stanley were crowned Champions . Having achieved this aim , Cook finally retired after almost 600 league appearances for nine different teams . After the end of the 2005\/06 season , Cook was granted a testimonial by Accrington as a thank-you for his hard work . It was played on 2 May 2006 at the Interlink Express ( now the Fraser Eagle ) Stadium , Accrington against a Burnley Select XI featuring old team-mates Dean West , Lenny Johnrose , Ian Cox , Kevin Ball and son Liam . Cook was appointed manager of Conference side Southport on 13 June 2006 , a post he was sacked from in January 2007 following defeat at Northwich Victoria . He became manager of Sligo Rovers on 27 April 2007 , taking over from Rob McDonald , who resigned before the start of the season . He guided Sligo to a credible 6th place league finish in his first season . His second year ( 2008 ) saw him guide Sligo to fourth in the league and thus secure a UEFA Cup place . He departed in January 2009 by mutual consent , but soon returned just weeks later . In his third season , under sever financial constraints , he guided Sligo to sixth place after a time when it appeared the Bit O'Red appeared certain relegation candidates . In addition , Cook guided Sligo to the final of the FAI Cup which took place on the 22nd November 2009 . Sligo lost 2-1 to Sporting Fingal despite holding a one goal lead with seven minutes remaining . His first silverware as Sligo manager came in September 2010 , after a 1-0 win over Monaghan United in the final of the League Cup . In November 2010 , he guided Sligo Rovers to win the 2010 FAI Cup Final , 2-0 in a penalty shoot-out against Shamrock Rovers .

The Sarcopterygii or lobe-finned fishes ( from Greek Ï Î Ï Î 3\/4 sarx , flesh , and Ï Ï Î Ï Ï Î 3\/4 pteryx , fin ) â `` sometimes considered synonymous with Crossopterygii ( `` fringe-finned fish '' , from Greek Î Ï Î Ï Ï Ï Ï krossos , fringe ) constitute a clade ( traditionally a class or subclass ) of the bony fishes , though a strict classification would include the terrestrial vertebrates . The living sarcopterygians are the coelacanths , lungfishes , and the tetrapods . Early sarcopterygians - crossopterygians are bony fish with fleshy , lobed-paired fins , which are joined to the body by a single bone . The fins of crossopterygians differ from those of all other fish in that each is borne on a fleshy , lobelike , scaly stalk extending from the body . Pectoral and pelvic fins have articulations resembling those of tetrapod limbs . These fins evolved into legs of the first tetrapod land vertebrates , amphibians . They also possess two dorsal fins with separate bases , as opposed to the single dorsal fin of actinopterygians ( ray-finned fish ) . The braincase of sarcoptergygians primitively has a hinge line , but this is lost in tetrapods and lungfish . Many early sarcopterygians have a symmetrical tail . All sarcopterygians possess teeth covered with true enamel . Taxonomists who subscribe to the cladistic approach include the grouping Tetrapoda within this group , which in turn consists of all species of four-limbed vertebrates . The fin-limbs of sarcopterygians such as the coelacanths show a strong similarity to the expected ancestral form of tetrapod limbs . The crossopterygians apparently followed two different lines of development and are accordingly separated into two subclasses , the Rhipidistia ( including the Dipnoi or lungfish , and the Tetrapodomorpha which include the Tetrapoda ) and the Actinistia ( coelacanths ) . Sarcopterygians and their relatives the actinopterygians ( `` ray-finned fish '' ) comprise the superclass Osteichthyes , the `` bony fish '' , characterized by their bony skeleton rather than cartilage . There are otherwise vast differences in fin , respiratory , and circulatory structures between the Sarcopterygii and the Actinopterygii . The first sarcopterygians , found in the uppermost Silurian ( ca 418 Ma ) , closely resembled the Acanthodians ( the `` spiny fish '' , a taxon that went extinct at the end of the Paleozoic ) . In the earlyâ `` middle Devonian ( 416 - 385 Ma ) , while the predatory placoderms dominated the seas , some sarcopterygians came into freshwater habitats . In the Early Devonian ( 416 - 397 Ma ) , the sarcopterygians split into two main lineages â '' the coelacanths and the rhipidistians . The former never left the oceans and their heyday was the late Devonian and Carboniferous , from 385 to 299 Ma , as they were more common during those periods than in any other period in the Phanerozoic ; coelacanths still live today in the oceans ( genus Latimeria ) . The Rhipidistians , whose ancestors probably lived in the oceans near the river mouths ( estuaries ) , left the ocean world and migrated into freshwater habitats . They in turn split into two major groups : the lungfish and the tetrapodomorphs . The lungfish evolved the first proto-lungs and proto-limbs ; they learned in the middle Devonian ( 397 - 385 Ma ) how to live outside a water environment , using their stubby fins ( proto-limbs ) to walk on land and find new water if their waterhole was depleted , and their lungs to breathe air and get sufficient oxygen . The lungfish 's greatest diversity was in the Triassic period ; today there are fewer than a dozen genera left . The first tetrapodomorphs , which included the gigantic rhizodonts , had the same general anatomy as the lungfish , who were their closest kin , but they appear not to have left their water habitat until the late Devonian epoch ( 385 - 359 Ma ) , with the appearance of tetrapods ( four-legged vertebrates ) . Tetrapods are the only tetrapodomorphs which survived after the Devonian . Non-tetrapod sarcopterygians continued until towards the end of Paleozoic era , suffering heavy losses during the Permian-Triassic extinction event ( 251 Ma ) . The classification below follows Benton 2004 , and uses a synthesis of rank-based Linnaean taxonomy and also reflects evolutionary relationships . Benton included the Superclass Tetrapoda in the Subclass Sarcopterygii in order to reflect the direct descent of tetrapods from lobe-finned fish , despite the former being assigned a higher taxonomic rank . The cladogram presented below is based on studies compiled by Philippe Janvier and others for the Tree of Life Web Project .

The Sudetes is a mountain range in Central Europe . It is also known as the Sudeten ( German ) or Sudety ( Czech , Polish ) Mountains . The Sudetes stretch from eastern Germany to Poland and the Czech Republic . The highest peak is SnÄ Å 3\/4 ka , ( Polish : Å nieÅ 1\/4 ka , German : Schneekoppe ) in the KrkonoÅ e ( Polish : Karkonosze ) Mountains on the Czech-Polish border , which is 1602 m in altitude . The current geomorphological unit in the Czech part of the mountain range is KrkonoÅ sko-jesenick Ã subprovincie ( `` KrkonoÅ e-Jesen Ã ky '' ) . The KrkonoÅ e Mountains have experienced growing tourism for winter sports during the past ten years . Their skiing resorts are becoming a budget alternative to the Alps . The name Sudetes has been derived from Sudeti montes , a Latinization of the name Soudeta ore used in the Geographia by Ptolemy ( Book 2 , Chapter 10 ) ca . 150 for the present-day northern Czech mountains . Ptolemy said that they were above the Gabreta Forest , which places them in the Sudetenland . Ptolemy wrote in Greek , in which the name is a neuter plural . Latin mons , however , is a masculine , hence Sudeti . The Latin version is likely to be a scholastic innovation , as it is not attested in classical Latin literature . The meaning of the name is not known . In one hypothetical derivation , it means Mountains of Wild Boars , relying on Indo-European \* su - , `` pig '' . A better etymology perhaps is from Latin sudis , plural sudes , `` spines '' , which can be used of spiny fish or spiny terrain . The exact location of the Sudetes has varied over the centuries . The ancient Sudeti meant at least the northwest frontier of today 's Czech Republic , probably extending to the north . By implication , it was part of the vast Hercynian Forest belt mentioned by several authors of the antiquity . In the Middle Ages German colonists were invited by the Piast dukes of Silesia and the PÅ emyslid kings of Bohemia to settle in the previously Slavic areas for agricultural and urban development in the course of the Ostsiedlung . After World War I the name came into use to describe areas of Czechoslovakia with large German populations . In 1918 the proclaimed rump state of German Austria comprised a Provinz Sudetenland in northern Moravia and Czech Silesia around the city of Opava . The term Sudetenland was used in a wider sense when on 1 October 1933 Konrad Henlein founded the Sudeten German Party and in Nazi German parlance Sudetendeutsche ( Sudeten Germans ) referred to all indigenous ethnic Germans in Czechoslovakia . They were heavily clustered , not only in the former Moravian Provinz Sudetenland but also along the northwestern Bohemian borderlands with German Lower Silesia , Saxony and Bavaria , in an area formerly called German Bohemia . In total the German minority population of pre-WWII Czechoslovakia numbered around 20 % of the total national population . Adolf Hitler redefined the term to mean the entire mountainous periphery of Czechoslovakia , and under that pretext , got his future enemies to concede the Czech defensive border in the 1938 Munich Agreement , leaving the remainder of Czechoslovakia shorn of its border fortifications and buffer zone , occupied by Germany in March 1939 . After being annexed by Nazi Germany , much of the region was redesignated as the Reichsgau of `` Sudetenland '' . A considerable proportion of Czechoslovak\/Czech and Polish populace thereafter strongly resisted use of the term Sudetes as it harks painfully to Nazi-German times . In the Czech Republic or Poland the designation is seldom used officially , as in maps etc. usually only in discrete Czech and Polish local names for the individual mountain ranges e.g. Karkonosze\/Krkono Å e appear , see Subdivisions above . After World War II , most of the German population within the Polish and Czechoslovak Sudetes was forcibly expelled on the basis of the Potsdam Agreement and the BeneÅ decrees . The occupation of the `` Sudetenland '' by Germany in 1938 â `` 1939 was discussed again in connection with the 2008 South Ossetia war and the secession of Kosovo .
The British Rail Class 22 or `` Baby Warship '' was a class of diesel-hydraulic locomotives designed for the Western Region and built by North British Locomotive Company . They were very similar in appearance to the Class 21 diesel-electrics . D6300 was introduced to traffic in 1959 and deliveries continued through until 1962 . The Class 22s were allocated to Bristol Bath Road , Laira Plymouth , Newton Abbot and Old Oak Common . Initially the locomotives had some problems with engine and transmission faults , but could be returned to North British Locomotive Works ( NBL ) for repair under the contractual agreement . By 1961 , reliability had improved . With the more powerful Hymeks and Warships being available , the locomotives were displaced onto more secondary lines . By the mid 1960s , the locos had settled down to give reliable service , with availability over 85 % . With NBL having gone bankrupt in 1962 , by the late 1960s withdrawn locomotives were used to provide spares : attrition was inevitable and the withdrawals which had commenced in 1967 finished with the withdrawal of 6333 , 6336 , 6338 and 6339 in December 1971 . Ex-Eastern Region Class 31 diesel-electrics were drafted in as replacements . The class is now extinct , but an attempt was made to preserve D6319 . A purchase price was agreed with BR but it was accidentally cut up by staff at Swindon Works . BR offered the purchaser a Warship class locomotive at the same price and D821 Greyhound thus became the first preserved ex-BR mainline diesel locomotive . The NBL type 2s were introduced in all-over green livery with a light gray skirt band , mid-grey roof , red buffer beams and black underframe . Numbers appeared below all four cab windows and the BR ` lion and wheel ' emblem was placed high on the bodyside as centrally as possible . Later a small yellow warning was added . From 1967 locos were repainted in the new corporate rail blue livery with full yellow ends . The ` arrows of confusion ' logo was placed immediately below each cab window , with the loco number below this ; on some locos this was reversed . Class 22 was also used as the TOPS classification for the dual voltage BB 22200 Class locomotives belonging to SNCF that were utilised on freight workings through the Channel Tunnel prior to the delivery of the Class 92 locomotives during 1994 and 1995 .

In anatomy , a septum ( Latin for something that encloses ; plural septa ) is a wall , dividing a cavity or structure into smaller ones . Histological septa are seen throughout most tissues of the body , particularly where they are needed to stiffen soft cellular tissue , and they also provide planes of ingress for small blood vessels . Because the dense collagen fibers of a septum usually extend out into the softer adjacent tissues , microscopic fibrous septa are less clearly defined than the macroscopic types of septa listed above . In rare instances , a septum is a cross-wall .
ReLoad is the seventh studio album by the American heavy metal band Metallica . It was released on November 18 , 1997 through Elektra Records . The album is a sequel or counterpart to the band 's previous album , Load . Only five of the thirteen songs have ever been played live . These songs include `` Fuel '' , `` The Memory Remains '' , `` Devil 's Dance '' , `` The Unforgiven II '' , and `` Low Man 's Lyric '' . ReLoad is currently certified 3x platinum by the RIAA . It was the final Metallica studio album to feature bassist Jason Newsted , though it was not his last release with the band . The original idea was to make Metallica 's sixth album a double album . But with problems recording so many songs at one time , the band decided that half of the songs were to be released and the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year . Drummer Lars Ulrich stated that , `` it 's the second half of Load . It 's just coming out a year-and-a-half later . '' This was the second album to feature all songs in Eâ tuning , though `` Devil 's Dance '' was played in D tuning which was earlier used for `` Sad but True '' on Metallica and later used for `` Whiskey in the Jar '' from Garage Inc.
`` Hyperion '' can also refer to the epistolary novel Hyperion by the German poet Friedrich HÃ lderlin . `` Hyperion '' is an abandoned epic poem by 19th-century English Romantic poet John Keats . It is based on the Titanomachia , and tells of the despair of the Titans after their fall to the Olympians . Keats wrote the poem from late 1818 until the spring of 1819 , when he gave it up as having `` too many Miltonic inversions . '' He was also nursing his younger brother Tom , who died on 1 December 1818 of tuberculosis . The themes and ideas were picked up again in Keats 's The Fall of Hyperion : A Dream , when he attempted to recast the epic by framing it with a personal quest to find truth and understanding . The Titans are a pantheon of gods who ruled prior to the Olympians , and are now destined to fall . They include Saturn ( king of the gods ) , Ops ( his wife ) , Thea ( his sister ) , Enceladus ( god of war ) , Oceanus ( god of the sea ) , Hyperion ( the god of the sun ) and Clymene ( a young goddess ) . The poem opens with Saturn bemoaning the loss of his power , which is being overtaken by Jupiter . Thea leads him to a place where the other Titans sit , similarly miserable , and they discuss whether they should fight back against their conquest by the new gods ( the Olympians ) . Oceanus declares that he is willing to surrender his power to Neptune ( the new god of the sea ) because Neptune is more beautiful ( this is worth bearing in mind in relation to the Romantic idea that beauty is paramount ) . Clymene describes first hearing the music of Apollo , which she found beautiful to the point of pain ( another Romantic idea ) . Finally , Enceladus makes a speech encouraging the Titans to fight . Meanwhile Hyperion 's palace is described , and we first see Hyperion himself , the only Titan who is still powerful . He is addressed by Uranus ( old god of the sky , father of Saturn ) , who encourages him to go to where Saturn and the other Titans are . We leave the Titans with the arrival of Hyperion , and the scene changes to Apollo ( the new sun god , also god of music , civilisation and culture ) weeping on the beach . Here Mnemosyne ( goddess of memory ) encounters him and he explains to her the cause of his tears : he is aware of his divine potential , but as yet unable to fulfill it . By looking into Mnemosyne 's eyes he receives knowledge which transforms him fully into a god . The poem breaks off at this point , in mid-line , with the word `` celestial '' . Deep in the shady sadness of a vale , Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn , Far from the fiery noon , and eve 's one star , Sat gray-hair 'd Saturn , quiet as a stone , Still as the silence round about his lair . The language of Hyperion is very similar to Milton 's , in meter and style . However , his characters are quite different . Although Apollo falls into the image of the `` Son '' from Paradise Lost and of `` Jesus '' from Paradise Regained , he does not directly confront Hyperion as Satan is confronted . Also , the roles are reversed , and Apollo is deemed as the `` challenger '' to the throne , who wins it by being more `` true '' and thus , more `` beautiful . '' Saturn is fallen , am I too to fall ? Am I to leave this haven of my rest , This cradle of my glory , this soft clime , This calm luxuriance of blissful light , These crystalline pavilions , and pure fanes , Of all my lucent empire ? It is left Deserted , void , nor any haunt of mine . The blaze , the splendor , and the symmetry , I can not see -- but darkness , death and darkness . Even here , into my center of repose , The shady visions come to domineer , Insult , and blind , and stifle up my pomp . -- Fall ! -- No , by Tellus and her briny robes ! Over the fiery frontier of my realms I will advance a terrible right arm Shall scare that infant thunderer , rebel Jove , And bid old Saturn take his throne again .
Pakistan Time ( PKT ) is the time zone for Pakistan . It is 5 hours ahead of GMT\/UTC ( UTC +05:00 ) . The only tz database zone is Asia\/Karachi . The current Pakistan time ( PKT ) was set up at midnight between 30th April and 1st May , 1954 . Before this , PKT used to be according to British ruled Calcutta local time as Indian standard time ( IST ) which came into use on 1st January , 1906 , and was also applied to Sri Lanka ( then Ceylon ) till partition of subcontinent . In 2009 , the clocks across the country were advanced by one hour on April 15 , 2009 . A statement by the Ministry of Interior said the Pakistan Time ( PKT ) was advanced by one hour to make full use of daylight . It said the clocks would be reversed again by an hour on October 31 , 2009 . Last year , the government had turned the clocks ahead on June 1 to avail an extra hour of daylight for conserving energy to contain the power shortfall . In 2002 , the government cabinet decided that `` in order to make maximum use of daylight and to save energy '' , they would adopt the daylight saving time ( DST ) system . This required the country to advance the time by one hour on the night between the first Saturday and Sunday of April , and revert to the original position on the first Sunday in October of 2002 at 00:00 . The Government of Pakistan decided to use DST again from June 1 , 2008 to October 31 , 2008 . DST was originally meant to end on August 31 , 2008 but the end date was changed by the Government to be October 31 , 2008 .

NiÃ vre is a department in the center of France named after the NiÃ vre River . NiÃ vre is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on March 4 , 1790 . It was created from the former province of Nivernais . NiÃ vre is part of the current region of Burgundy , although historically it was not part of the province of Burgundy , and it is surrounded by the departments of Yonne , CÃ te-d ` Or , SaÃ ne-et-Loire , Allier , Cher , and Loiret . The dÃ partement is crossed by the Loire river , the longest river in France . NiÃ vre is a rural department with about 50 inhabitants \/ kmÂ . The main cities are : Nevers , Cosne-sur-Loire , Varennes-Vauzelles , Marzy , Decize , Imphy and La CharitÃ . Only three cities reach 10 000 inhabitants . It indicates the characteristic of the dÃ partement , which is rural . NiÃ vre is also well known for its white wine , Pouilly FumÃ . The vineyards are scattered around villages including Pouilly-Sur-Loire , which lends its name to the appellation , Tracy sur Loire , Boisgibault , Saint Andelain . The word fumÃ is French for `` smoky '' , and it 's said the name comes from the smoky or flinty quality of these wines . The only grape allowed in the Pouilly-Fum Ã AC is Sauvignon Blanc , which produces wines that are generally crisp , tart , and somewhat grassy . In common with most French wine producing departments NiÃ vre is traditionally a left wing department . The results of the second round of voting in presidential elections spell this out consistently .
Something ( a company , language or organization ) international mostly means that it involves more than one nation ( country ) . The term international as a word means involvement of , interaction between or encompassing more than one nation , or generally beyond national boundaries . For example , international law , which is applied by more than one country over the world , and international language which is a language spoken by residents of more than one country . In American English , `` International '' is also commonly used as a euphemism for `` foreign '' or even `` foreigner . '' The term `` global '' is commonly used as a synonym for `` international '' , however such usage is typically incorrect as `` global '' implies `` one world '' as a single unit , while `` international '' recognizes that different peoples , cultures , languages , nations , borders , economies , and ecosystems exist . The word nonetheless sees usage as in various media buzzwords , such as `` the global economy '' .
666 is the natural number following 665 and preceding 667 . ( For the year 666 AD , see 666 ) Six hundred ( and ) sixty six is the sum of the first 36 natural numbers ( i.e. ) , and thus a triangular number . Since 36 is both square and triangular , 666 is the sixth number of the form and the eighth number of the form ( doubly triangular numbers ) . 666 is an abundant number . The number of prime numbers up to 666 is 121 , the square of the number of prime numbers up to 36 . 666 is the sum of the squares of the first 7 prime numbers : 4 +9 +25 +49 +121 +169 +289 = 666 . 666 is the 60th 12-factored number ; 60 is the first 12-factored number . The harmonic mean of the decimal digits of 666 is ( trivially â '' all repdigit natural numbers have this property ) an integer : 3 \/ ( 1\/6 + 1\/6 + 1\/6 ) = 6 , making 666 the 54th number with this property . In base 10 , 666 is a repdigit ( and therefore a palindromic number ) and a Smith number . A prime reciprocal magic square based on 1\/149 in base 10 has a magic total of 666 . The Roman numeral for 666 , DCLXVI , has exactly one occurrence of all symbols whose value is less than 1000 ( D = 500 , C = 100 , L = 50 , X = 10 , V = 5 , I = 1 ) . In the New Testament , the Book of Revelation cryptically asserts 666 to be `` the number of a man , '' associated with the beast , an antagonistic creature that appears briefly about two-thirds into the apocalyptic vision . In modern popular culture , 666 has become one of the most widely recognized symbols for the Antichrist or , alternately , the Devil . Earnest references to 666 occur both among apocalypticist Christian groups and in explicitly anti-Christian subcultures . An appearance of the number 666 in contemporary Western art or literature is , more likely than not , an intentional reference to this number of the Beast symbolism . Such popular references to 666 are too numerous to list . It is not uncommon to see the symbolic role of the integer 666 transferred to the digit sequence 6-6-6 . Some people take the Satanic associations of 666 so seriously that they actively avoid things related to 666 or the digits 6-6-6 . This is known as hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia .
Ontario Lacus is a lake composed of methane , ethane and propane near the south pole of Saturn 's moon Titan . Its character as a hydrocarbon lake was confirmed by observations from the Cassini spacecraft , published in the 31 July 2008 edition of Nature . Ontario Lacus has a surface area of about 15,000 square kilometers ( 6,000 square miles ) , slightly smaller than its terrestrial namesake , Lake Ontario in North America . On January 12 , 2010 , Cassini took a more detailed radar-image of Ontario Lacus showing numerous remarkable features . The northern shoreline features low hills , probably about 1 kilometer ( 3,000 feet ) in altitude , and flooded river valleys . A smooth , wave-sculpted shoreline , like that seen on the southeastern side of Lake Michigan , can be seen at the northeastern part of the lake . Smooth lines parallel to the current shoreline could be formed by low waves over time , which were likely driven by winds sweeping in from the west or southwest . The southeast shore features a round-headed bay intruding into the shore . The middle part of the western shoreline shows the first well-developed river delta observed on Titan , showing that liquid hydrocarbons flowing down from a higher plain have switched channels on their way into the lake , forming at least two lobes . Examples of this kind of channel switching and wave-modified deltas can be found on Earth at the southern end of Lake Albert between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa and the remains of an ancient lake known as Megachad in the African country Chad . By terrestrial standards , the lake appears to be extremely shallow . Radar measurements made in July 2009 and January 2010 indicate an average depth of 0.4 â `` 3.2 m , and a maximum depth of 2.9 â `` 7.4 m. This gives the lake an estimated volume of 7 to 50 km3 , less than one thirtieth the volume of Earth 's Lake Ontario . Any waves present on the lake are also far smaller than those that would be present on a sizable body of liquid water on Earth ; their estimated maximum height is less than 1 mm . This could either indicate a complete lack of wind , or a viscous composition of the hydrocarbon fluid .
What Is This ? ( known prior to 1980 as Anthym ) was a rock band that originated in Fairfax High School in California and would play numerous shows along the coast of California . They were formed before and played around the same time as the Red Hot Chili Peppers . Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers was one of two original people who acted as roadies for the band and would introduce the band before they went on stage . The band played many local Los Angeles California area gigs as Anthym , then changed their name to `` What Is This ? '' shortly before they were asked to open for the band Oingo Boingo at The Country Club in Reseda for the debut of their first album Only A Lad . Original Red Hot Chili Peppers members Hillel Slovak and Jack Irons left that band just prior to it receiving its first record contract , preferring to focus on What Is This ? . Slovak rejoined the Chili Peppers for their second album and Irons for their third album . The name What Is This ? refers to the reaction of people listening to their music . After the joining of Natasha Shneider the band was first renamed Walk the Moon and then Eleven . The band , in their early days , are referenced numerous times in Kiedis 's autobiography , Scar Tissue . The band released three albums in the early to mid-80s . Their song , `` Mind My Have Still I '' from their 1984 EP Squeezed , was also featured on the soundtrack to the movie The Wild Life . Their second album , which featured a cover of the Spinners hit `` I 'll Be Around '' , was produced by Todd Rundgren , who also played Fairlight Synthesizer on the record . `` I 'll Be Around '' was released as a single and video ; it peaked at # 62 on the Billboard Hot 100 . There is no confirmation or denial that the original name , Anthym , was inspired by Canadian band Rush , whose 1975 song `` Anthem '' gave name to their own record label . That song was in turn inspired by the novella of the same name by author Ayn Rand , who , at the time , was a major influence on Rush drummer\/lyricist Neil Peart . The `` y '' variation in Anthym is said to have been taken from `` Ayn '' .

A memorial is an object which serves as a focus for memory of something , usually a person ( who has died ) or an event . Popular forms of memorials include landmark objects or art objects such as sculptures , statues or fountains , and even entire parks . The most common type of memorial is the gravestone or the memorial plaque . Also common are war memorials commemorating those who have died in wars . Memorials in the form of a cross are called intending crosses . Online Memorials and tributes are becoming increasingly popular especially with the increase in natural burial where the laying of gravestones , or memorial plaques , is often not permitted . Online tributes and memorials create a way for family and friends from various countries to interact and share memories and photographs . This is becoming more and more popular as it provides a private space that can be easily reflected upon at any time . When somebody has died , the family may request that a memorial gift ( usually money ) be given to a designated charity , or that a tree be planted in memory of the person . Sometimes , when a high school student has died , the memorials are placed in the form of a scholarship , to be awarded to high-achieving students in future years .
Lama ( ; `` chief '' or `` high priest '' ) is a title for a Tibetan teacher of the Dharma . The name is similar to the Sanskrit term guru ( see Tibetan Buddhism and BÃ n ) . Historically , the term was used for venerated spiritual masters or heads of monasteries . Today the title can be used as an honorific title conferred on a monk , nun or ( in the Nyingma , Kagyu and Sakya schools ) advanced tantric practitioner to designate a level of spiritual attainment and authority to teach , or may be part of a title such as Dalai Lama or Panchen Lama applied to a lineage of reincarnate lamas ( Tulkus ) . Perhaps due to misunderstandings by early western scholars attempting to understand Tibetan Buddhism , the term Lama has historically been erroneously applied to Tibetan monks generally . Similarly , Tibetan Buddhism was referred to as Lamaism by early western scholars and travelers who perhaps did not understand that what they were witnessing was a form of Buddhism ; they may also have been unaware of the distinction between Tibetan Buddhism and BÃ n. The term Lamaism is now considered by some to be derogatory . In the Vajrayana practice path of Tibetan Buddhism , the lama is often the tantric spiritual guide , the guru to the aspiring Buddhist yogi or yogini . As such , the lama will then appear as one of the Three Roots ( a variant of the Three Jewels ) , alongside the yidam and protector ( who may be a dakini , dharmapala or other Buddhist deity figure ) .
The Department of the Navy of the United States of America ( DON ) was established by an Act of Congress on 30 April 1798 , to provide a government organizational structure to the United States Navy and , from 1834 onwards , for the United States Marine Corps , and when directed by the President , of the United States Coast Guard as a service within the Navy . The Department of the Navy was an Executive Department and the Secretary of the Navy was a member of the President 's cabinet position , until 1949 when amendments to the National Security Act of 1947 changed the name of the National Military Establishment to the Department of Defense and made it an Executive Department . The Department of the Navy then became , along with the Department of the Army & Department of the Air Force , a Military Department within the Department of Defense : subject to the authority , direction and control of the Secretary of Defense . The Department of the Navy is headed by the Secretary of the Navy , also known as the SECNAV in naval jargon , who has the authority to conduct all of the affairs of the Department : subject to lawful authority , the Secretary of Defense , and the President . The Secretary of the Navy is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate . The Secretary is assisted by an Under Secretary of the Navy , four Assistant Secretaries of the Navy and a General Counsel of the Department of the Navy , who are also appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate . The highest ranking military officers in the Department of the Navy are the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine Corps , who are the principal military advisors to the Secretary of the Navy . They supervise their respective military services of the Department of the Navy , and in a separate capacity serves as members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . They are assisted by a Vice Chief of Naval Operations and an Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps . Unlike its Army and Air Force counterparts , the Department of the Navy comprises two uniformed services , also called the Naval Services , the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps . The Department of the Navy consists of all elements of the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps . The Term `` Navy Department '' , according to Navy Regulations Section 0204-2 , refers only to the executive offices at the Seat of Government . In H.R. 1585 , the Fiscal Year 2008 National Defense Authorization Bill ( NDAA ) for 2008 , the Department of the Navy was to be renamed the Department of the Navy and Marine Corps . The Bill passed in the U.S. House of Representatives on 17 May 2007 . The proposed renaming encountered opposition among members of the DOD civilian leadership and among senior Navy admirals and Marine Corps generals . In the U.S. Senate , the House Bill was replaced by SA2011 , an amendment in the nature of a substitute , removing the renaming provision along with other changes . The amendment was sponsored by Senator Carl Levin , Democrat of Michigan , introduced on 9 July 2007 , and agreed to by unanimous consent on 1 October 2007 . The House version including the provision was withdrawn in conference committee .

A nanosecond ( ns ) is one billionth of a second ( 10-9 s ) . One nanosecond is to one second as one second is to 31.7 years . The word nanosecond is formed by the prefix nano and the unit second . Its symbol is ns . A nanosecond is equal to 1000 picoseconds or 1\/1000 microsecond . Because the next SI unit is 1000 times larger , times of 10-8 and 10-7 seconds are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of nanoseconds . Times of this magnitude are commonly encountered in telecommunications , pulsed lasers and some areas of electronics . Some notable measurements in this range include :
Taz-Mania is a cartoon show produced by Warner Bros. . Animation from 1991 â `` 1993 , broadcast in the United States on Fox from 1991-1995 .

Barry Switzer ( born October 5 , 1937 ) is a former football coach , active in the college and professional ranks between 1962 and 1997 . He has one of the highest winning percentages of any college football coach in history , and is one of only two head coaches to win both a college football national championship and a Super Bowl ( the other being a rival college head coach Jimmy Johnson . ) Born in Crossett , Arkansas , Switzer 's father Frank was a bootlegger who was arrested at the family house . His mother Mary Louise raised Barry and his brother Donnie , but on August 26 , 1959 she shot herself . Barry accepted an athletic scholarship and played football at the University of Arkansas . After graduation , he did a brief stint in the U.S. Army and then returned to Arkansas as an assistant coach . Following the 1966 season , Switzer moved to the University of Oklahoma as an assistant coach under new Head Coach and good friend Jim Mackenzie . After Mackenzie died of a heart attack following spring practice of 1967 , Switzer continued as an assistant under former University of Houston assistant and new Oklahoma head coach Chuck Fairbanks . Switzer quickly made a name for himself by perfecting the wishbone offense and developing it into the most prolific rushing offense in college football history . Under Switzer 's wishbone , the Sooners set an NCAA rushing record of 472 yards per game in 1971 and scored over 500 points in two different seasons , 1971 and 1986 . When Fairbanks accepted the position of Head Coach of the New England Patriots following the 1972 season , Switzer was the obvious choice to succeed him . Switzer became head coach at Oklahoma in 1973 , leading the team to undefeated seasons that year and the next . Oklahoma won national championships in 1974 , 1975 and 1985 under Switzer 's leadership . The team won or shared in the Big Eight Conference championship every year from 1973 to 1980 . During his sixteen years as head coach at Oklahoma , his teams won eight of the thirteen post-season bowl games they played in , and 54 of his players were selected as All-Americans . In 1978 , Billy Sims won the Heisman Trophy . In 1989 , Oklahoma was placed on probation by the NCAA amidst several scandals involving Oklahoma players , including Charles Thompson 's arrest for soliciting cocaine to undercover FBI agents . In that same year , after sixteen years as Oklahoma 's head coach , Switzer chose to resign . Switzer succeeded in getting the better of several famous contemporaries , including a 12 â `` 5 mark against Tom Osborne , 5 â `` 3 against Jimmy Johnson , 3 â `` 0 against Bobby Bowden , and 1 â `` 0 against Joe Paterno and Woody Hayes . Along with Bennie Owen , Bud Wilkinson and Bob Stoops , he is one of four coaches to win over 100 games at the University of Oklahoma . No other college football program has more than three coaches to accomplish such a feat . Switzer was known as an outstanding recruiter of high school talent , particularly in the neighboring state of Texas . This may have contributed to his 9 â `` 5 â `` 2 record against the University of Texas , including a 3 â `` 0 â `` 1 record against Darrel Royal , a 4 â `` 5 â `` 1 record against Fred Akers , and a 2 â `` 0 mark against David McWilliams . Switzer resurfaced in coaching in 1994 with the Dallas Cowboys . Switzer stepped in following the departure of Jimmy Johnson , who as head coach had won the previous two Super Bowls . Johnson had clashed with owner Jerry Jones ( leading to his departure ) and many felt that Switzer was more apt to go along with Jerry 's ideas . Switzer was successful with the Cowboys , going 12 -- 4 his first season in 1994 ( losing to the 49ers in the NFC Championship ) . In Switzer 's second season of 1995 , the team went 12 -- 4 . Dallas won Super Bowl XXX over the Pittsburgh Steelers , 27 -- 17 , making Switzer one of only two coaches to win a college national championship and a Super Bowl ( the other being Jimmy Johnson ) . Switzer resigned as Cowboys ' coach after a 6 -- 10 1997 season with a 45 -- 26 career NFL coaching record . Switzer was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2002 . In 2004 , he received the Jim Thorpe Lifetime Achievement Award . Switzer still resides in Norman Oklahoma with his wife Becky . In August 2007 , XMSN added Barry Switzer as a part of the channel 's expanded college sports coverage . On 2007-09-09 , Barry Switzer joined the FOX NFL Pregame show . Switzer also guest-starred in an episode of TNT 's Saving Grace titled `` Do You Love Him ? '' , which first aired August 11 , 2008 .

With partner and fiancÃ e Albena Denkova , he is the 2006 & 2007 World Champion , the 2003 & 2004 European silver medalist , and the 2006 â `` 2007 Grand Prix Final champion . Denkova & Staviski are the first Bulgarian figure skaters to medal at the World Figure Skating Championships . Staviski is originally from Russia . He originally competed for Russia with Anastasia Belova . He teamed up with Albena Denkova in 1996 and began competing for Bulgaria . They soon became a couple off-ice , as well . Staviski received Bulgarian citizenship . In 2000 Denkova\/Staviski moved from Sofia to Odintsovo , to have better training conditions .

After the 2005 World Championships , Denkova and Staviski moved to Delaware , U.S. , to train with Natalia Linichuk and Gennadi Karponossov . On October 18 , 2007 , when he was put on trial for a drunk driving case which left one person dead , Staviski announced he would end his skating career . Denkova and Staviski are engaged to marry . Their son Daniel was born in January 30 , 2011 . In April 2007 , Denkova and Staviski were awarded the Stara Planina Order , the highest Bulgarian award .

Staviski could have gone to prison for up to ten years . On February 12 , the parents of one of the victims , Manuela Gorsova , said they would appeal both the suspended sentence and the damages awarded by the court . In early January 2009 , the Burgas Appellate Court reversed the suspension of his sentence and ordered Staviski to serve two-and-a-half years in prison . They also increased the amount of money Staviski was ordered to pay to his victims ' familiesâ '' BGN 120,000 to Petrov 's parents ( increased from BGN 90,000 ) , and BGN 150,000 to Gorsova 's family ( up from BGN 80,000 ) . He plans to appeal the decision . In May 2009 , the Supreme Court of Cassation issued a final ruling in the case , which overturned the jail sentence and reduced the fines Staviski was to pay to 100,000 leva to the Petrovs and 90,000 to Gorsova 's family .
Twinkies are an American snack cake made and distributed by Hostess Brands . They are marketed as a `` Golden Sponge Cake with Creamy Filling '' . Twinkies were invented in Schiller Park , Illinois in about 1930 by James Alexander Dewar , a baker for the Continental Baking Company . Realizing that several machines used to make cream-filled strawberry shortcake sat idle when strawberries were out of season , Dewar conceived a snack cake filled with banana cream , which he dubbed the Twinkie . During World War II , bananas were rationed and the company was forced to switch to vanilla cream . This change proved popular , and banana-cream Twinkies became a part of history . The original flavor was occasionally found in limited-time promotions , but the company exclusively used vanilla cream for most Twinkies . In 1988 , Fruit and Cream Twinkies were introduced with a strawberry filling swirled into the cream , however , the product was soon dropped . Vanilla 's dominance over Twinkie flavoring would be challenged in 2005 , following a month-long promotion of the movie King Kong . Hostess saw its Twinkie sales rise 20 percent during the promotion , and in 2007 permanently restored the banana-cream Twinkie to its snack lineup . A deep-fried Twinkie involves freezing the cake , dipping it into batter , and deep-frying it to create a variation on the traditional snack cake . It was described by a The New York Times story in this way : `` Something magical occurs when the pastry hits the hot oil . The creamy white vegetable shortening filling liquefies , impregnating the sponge cake with its luscious vanilla flavor ... The cake itself softens and warms , nearly melting , contrasting with the crisp , deep-fried crust in a buttery and suave way . The piece de resistance , however , is a ruby-hued berry sauce , adding a tart sophistication to all that airy sugary goodness '' . The Texas State Fair had introduced the fried Twinkie to great popular acclaim , and the notion spread to other state fairs across the U.S. , as well as some establishments that specialize in fried foods . Fried Twinkies are sold throughout the U.S. in fairs as well as ball games . The Twinkie defense is a derogatory term for a criminal defendant 's claim that some unusual factor ( such as allergies , coffee , nicotine , or sugar ) diminished the defendant 's responsibility for the alleged crime . The term arose from Herb Caen 's description of the trial of Dan White , who was convicted in the fatal shootings of San Francisco mayor George Moscone and city supervisor Harvey Milk . During the trial , psychiatrist Martin Blinder testified that White had suffered from depression , causing diminished capacity ; as an example of this , he mentioned that White , formerly a health food advocate , had begun eating junk food . Twinkies , specifically , were never actually mentioned in the case . A website entitled the T.W.I.N.K.I.E.S. Project was launched in 2000 by Christopher Scott Gouge and Todd William Stadler . This site chronicles a series of regimented scientific experiments testing , amongst others , the insulative , electrically resistive , radioactive , and gravitational properties of the `` Standard Twinkie '' . A common urban legend claims that Twinkies have a shelf life of forever , or can last for a relatively long time of ten , fifty , or one hundred years due to chemicals used in production . While this urban legend is false , they can last a relatively long time ( 25 days or more ) , because Twinkies are made without unstabilized dairy products or eggs and thus spoil slower than most bakery items . In 2010 a college professor named Mark Haub went on a `` convenience store '' diet consisting mainly of Twinkies , Oreos , and Doritos in an attempt to demonstrate to his students `` that in weight loss , pure calorie counting is what matters mostâ '' not the nutritional value of the food '' . He lost 27 pounds over a 2 month period , returning his BMI to within normal range .
The Treaty of Peace with Germany or the Treaty of Berlin in 1921 , are terms used to describe the separate post-World War I peace treaty between the United States and Germany , signed on August 25 , 1921 . It followed the U.S. Senate 's rejection of parts of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles , based on the Lodge Reservations , and Republican Warren G. Harding 's defeat of the League of Nations advocate and Democratic candidate , James M. Cox , in the 1920 presidential election . Within days , the United States also signed separate treaties with Austria , and Hungary .
The Massif Central ( Occitan : MassÃ s Central \/ MassÃ s Centrau ) is an elevated region in south-central France , consisting of mountains and plateaux . Subject to volcanism that has subsided in the last 10,000 years , these central mountains are separated from the Alps by a deep north-south cleft created by the RhÃ ne River and known in French as the sillon rhodanien ( literally `` the furrow of the RhÃ ne '' ) . The region was a barrier to communication until the opening of the A75 motorway , which not only made north-south travel easier , but also opened up the Massif Central itself . It is situated in the middle of southern France and it covers 15 percent of the country . The following dÃ partements are generally considered as part of the Massif Central : Allier , ArdÃ che , Aude , Aveyron , Cantal , CorrÃ ze , Creuse , Gard , Haute-Loire , Haute-Vienne , HÃ rault , Loire , Lot , LozÃ re , Puy-de-D Ã me , RhÃ ne and Tarn . The following rÃ gions are part of the Massif Central : Auvergne , Limousin . Part of the following rÃ gions are in the Massif Central : Languedoc-Roussillon , Midi-Pyr Ã nÃ es , and RhÃ ne-Alpes . The largest cities are Clermont-Ferrand and Saint - Ã tienne . Volcanic rocks on northern part of the Massif Central dominate south France to the west of RhÃ ne valley and limestone , granite and slate ( schist ) on southern part . The Massif Central is a distinct physiographic province of the smaller Central European Uplands division . The entire region contains the largest concentration of extinct volcanoes in the world with approximately 450 volcanoes . One strip alone running north to south and less than 60 s contains 115 of them .

Puncak Jaya ( pronounced ) , sometimes called Mount Carstensz or the Carstensz Pyramid , is a mountain in the Sudirman Range , the western central highlands of Papua province , Indonesia ( within Puncak Jaya Regency ) . Other names include Nemangkawi in the Amungkal language , Ngga Pulu , Carstensz Toppen and Gunung Sukarno . At 4884 m above sea level , Puncak Jaya is the highest mountain in Indonesia , the highest on the island of New Guinea ( which comprises the Indonesian Papua provinces plus Papua New Guinea ) , the highest of Oceania ( Australia ) , and the 5th highest mountain in political Southeast Asia . It is also the highest point between the Himalayas and the Andes , and the highest island peak in the world . Some sources claim Mount Wilhelm , 4509 m , as the highest mountain peak in Oceania , on account of Indonesia being part of Asia ( Southeast Asia ) . The highlands surrounding the peak were inhabited before European contact , and the peak was known as Nemangkawi in Amungkal . Puncak Jaya was named `` Carstensz Pyramid '' after Dutch explorer Jan Carstensz who first sighted the glaciers on the peak of the mountain on a rare clear day in 1623 . The sighting went unverified for over two centuries , and Carstensz was ridiculed in Europe when he said he had seen snow near the equator . This name is still used among mountaineers . Although the snowfield of Puncak Jaya was reached as early as 1909 by a Dutch explorer , Hendrik Albert Lorentz with six of his indigenous Dayak Kenyah porters recruited from the Apo Kayan in Borneo , the peak was not climbed until 1962 , by an expedition led by the Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer ( of Seven Years in Tibet fame , and climber of the Eiger North Face ) with three other expedition members â '' Philip Temple , Russell Kippax and Bert Huizenga . Temple , from New Zealand , had previously led an expedition into the area and pioneered the access route to the mountains . When Indonesia took control of the province in the 1960s , the peak was renamed ` Puntjak Soekarno ' ( Simplified Indonesian : Puncak Sukarno ) or Sukarno Peak , after the first President of Indonesia ; later this was changed to Puncak Jaya . Puncak means peak or mountain and Jaya means ` victory ' , ` victorious ' or ` glorious ' . Puncak Jaya is the highest point on the central range , which was created in the late Miocene Melanesian orogeny , caused by oblique collision between the Australian and Pacific plates and is made of middle Miocene limestones . Access to the peak requires a government permit . The mountain was closed to tourists and climbers between 1995 and 2005 . As of 2006 , access is possible through various adventure tourism agencies . While Puncak Jayaâ s peak is free of ice , there are several glaciers on its slopes , including the Carstensz Glacier and the Northwall Firn . Being equatorial , there is little variation in the mean temperature during the year ( around 0.5 Â C ) and the glaciers fluctuate on a seasonal basis only slightly . However , analysis of the extent of these rare equatorial glaciers from historical records show significant retreat since the 1850s , around the time of the Little Ice Age Maximum which primarily affected the Northern Hemisphere , indicating a regional warming of around 0.6 Â C per century between 1850 and 1972 . The glacier on Puncak Trikora in the Maoke Mountains disappeared completely some time between 1939 and 1962 . Since the 1970s , evidence from satellite imagery indicates the Puncak Jaya glaciers have been retreating rapidly . The Meren Glacier melted away sometime between 1994 and 2000 . An expedition led by paleoclimatologist Lonnie Thompson in 2010 found that the glaciers are receding at a rate of seven meters per year and will disappear in four to five years . Puncak Jaya is one of the more demanding climbs in one version of the Seven Summits peak-bagging list . ( It is replaced by Mount Kosciuszko in the other version . ) It is held to have the highest technical rating , though not the greatest physical demands of that list 's ascents . The standard route is up the north face and along the summit ridge , which is all hard rock surface . Despite the large mine , the area is highly inaccessible to hikers and the general public , requiring a 100-km hike from the nearest town with an airport , Timika , to the base camp , which usually takes about four or five days each way .

West Sussex is a county in the south of England , bordering onto East Sussex ( with Brighton and Hove ) , Hampshire and Surrey . The county of Sussex has been divided into East and West since the 12th century , and obtained separate county councils in 1888 , but it remained a single ceremonial county until 1974 and the coming into force of the Local Government Act 1972 . Also at this time the Mid Sussex region ( including Haywards Heath , Burgess Hill and East Grinstead ) was transferred from East Sussex . West Sussex is a diverse county ; it is well known for its stately homes and castles such as Arundel Castle and Bramber Castle . Over half of the county is protected countryside , offering popular walking and cycling ground for visitors and residents alike . Chichester is the county town of West Sussex , and the highest point of the county is Black Down , at 280 metres ( 919 ft , ) . Most settlements in West Sussex are either along the south coast or in Mid Sussex , near the M23\/A23 corridor . The new town of Crawley and coastal settlement Worthing are the largest in the county , with populations of approximately 100,000 inhabitants each . The seaside resort of Bognor Regis and market town Horsham are both large towns . Chichester , the county town , has a cathedral and city status , and is situated not far from the border with Hampshire . Other towns of a similar size are Burgess Hill , East Grinstead and Haywards Heath in the Mid Sussex district , Littlehampton in the Arun district , and Lancing , Southwick and Shoreham in the Adur district . Rustington and Southwater are the next largest settlements in the county . There are several more towns in West Sussex , although they are of similar size to other villages . The smaller towns of the county are Arundel , Midhurst , Petworth , and Steyning . The larger villages are Billingshurst , Copthorne , Crawley Down , Cuckfield , Henfield , Hassocks , Hurstpierpoint , Lindfield , Pulborough , and Storrington . The M23\/A23 and A24 roads run from London to Brighton and Worthing respectively with the A29 a little further west ending in Bognor Regis . Other major roads are the A272 which runs east to west through the middle of the county and the A27 which does the same but closer to the coast . The A259 is a local alternate route to the A27 in the eastern coastal strip . Gatwick Airport , which handled over 32 million passengers in 2005 , is located to the north of Crawley , and is the second largest airport in the United Kingdom . There is also a considerably smaller local airport at Shoreham and a grass airfield handling light aircraft and helicopters at Goodwood . There are three main railway routes : the Brighton Main Line , the Arun Valley Line and the West Coastway Line . West Sussex County Council , based at County Hall Chichester , provides a large range of services including education , social services , fire and rescue , libraries , town and country planning , refuse disposal and consumer services . In addition , there are seven local government districts within the county of West Sussex : The foundation of the Kingdom of Sussex is recorded by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the year AD 477 , it says that Ã lle arrived at a place called Cymenshore in three ships with his three sons and killed or put to flight the local inhabitants , the foundation story is regarded as somewhat of a myth by most historians , however the archaeology suggests that Saxons did start to settle in the area in the late 5th century . The Kingdom of Sussex became the county of Sussex , and the county of Sussex eventually was split into the counties of East and West Sussex . Although the name Sussex is derived from the Saxon period between AD 477 to 1066 , the history of human habitation in Sussex goes back to the Old Stone Age . Sussex has been occupied since those times and has succumbed to various invasions and migrations throughout its long history .

Quierzy ( also known as Quierzy-sur-Oise ) is a commune in the Aisne department in Picardy in northern France , straddling the Oise River between Noyon and Chauny . Today 's peaceful village was the site of a major villa or palatium in the Merovingian and Carolingian eras , and the site of assemblies of the Frankish nobles , of synods of bishops and abbots and other important events . Here Charles Martel died , 22 October 741 . The name of the place appears variously in documents : Cariciacum , Carisiacum , Charisagum , Karisiacum . Of the royal residence of the Merovingians and the house of Pepin , only traces of earthworks remain , in fields outside Quierzy , in the direction of Manicamp . The early medieval ChÃ cents teau de Quierzy on the bank of the Oise , rebuilt in the fifteenth century as the fortress of the bishops of Noyon , survives as a single tower . Quierzy was already a significant stronghold of Neustria recorded in events in the Chronicle of Fredegar at the opening of the seventh century , when Protadius , the mayor of the palace of Burgundy was the noble lover of Brunhilda , the grandmother of and regent for King Theuderic II . Brunhilda pressured her grandson to go to war against her other grandson , Theudebert II of Austrasia , but when Theuderic assembled the army at Quierzy in 606 , the men did not want to fight their fellow Franks : Protadius was promptly killed by the warriors , who forced the king to sign a treaty . In January 754 Pepin the Short received Pope Stephen II at Quierzy , and his decision was taken to adopt the Roman liturgy and Gregorian chant in his domains . The Donation of Pippin is alleged to have been made at Quierzy to Pope Stephen II , granting him the Exarchate of Ravenna . For his part the pope legitimized the Carolingians . Charlemagne confirmed this donation in 774 , in Rome . Pepin spent the winter of 762 at Quierzy . Charlemagne convoked an assembly of the nobles here in January 775 , in preparation of his invasion of Saxony . In 804 Pope Leo III met Charlemagne at Quierzy before proceeding to Aachen . In December 842 Charles the Bald married Ermentrude d'Orl Ã ans at Quierzy . In the ninth century several councils of Quierzy debated contentious issues . At the synod of 853 , the famous four decrees or chapters ( capitula ) drawn up by Hincmar , archbishop of Reims , on the questions of predestination were published , and Gottschalk condemned . The Capitulary of Quierzy was promulgated in June 877 by the emperor Charles the Bald , comprising a series of measures for safeguarding the administration of his realm during his second Italian expedition , as well as directions for his son Louis the Stammerer , who was entrusted with the government during his father 's absence . A great concourse of lords was assembled to hear it read . In this document Charles took elaborate precautions against Louis the German , whom he had every reason to distrust . He forbids him to sojourn in certain palaces and in certain forests , and compels him to swear not to despoil his stepmother Richilde of her allodial lands and benefices . At the same time Charles refuses to allow Louis to nominate his candidates to the countships left vacant in the emperor 's absence . The capitulary thus served as a guarantee to the aristocracy that the general usage would be followed in the existing circumstances , and also as a means of reassuring the counts who had accompanied the emperor into Italy as to the fate of their benefices . In the following century , however , Viking raids destroyed the palatium , and Hugh Capet gave his lands at Quierzy to the bishop of Noyon , who built a fortress to serve in confrontations with the powerful lords of Coucy . In ensuing centuries , the lands of Quierzy passed successively to the ChÃ risy , the Montmorency , the Roye , the Halluin , the BrÃ '' lart and Bussy-Rabutin families , until the French Revolution . The town lies on the left bank of the river Oise , which flows westward through the commune . The river Ailette joins the Oise in the eastern part of the commune .

The hindlimbs of fabrosaurids show that the tibia is considerably longer than the femur , a feature that suggests that fabrosaurids were adapted for bipedality , and were fast runners . A Planet Called Treason ( 1979 ) is a science fiction novel by Orson Scott Card . It was originally published by St Martin 's Press and Dell Publishing Co. . After being heavily revised , the book was republished under the title Treason ( 1988 ) by St. Martin 's Press . The premise of this novel is the banishment to the seemingly metal-poor planet Treason of a group of people who attempted to create rule by an intellectual elite . The novel centers on the descendants of these anti-democratic thinkers who remain imprisoned on the planet . Through the ages , these descendants have formed nations which warred and allied with one another to gain advantages over their rivals in the race to build a starship . Due to the metal-deficiency on Treason , nations are forced to obtain it through a system of barter using teleportation devices known as Ambassadors . The protagonist of the book is Lanik Mueller , heir apparent to the Mueller family kingdom . The Muellers , through generations of eugenics , have the ability to heal at an accelerated speed and regrow body parts naturally . The dark side to the Mueller nation is that , in order to obtain iron and other metals , they trade organs and body parts , which are harvested from radical regeneratives ( `` rads '' ) . Radical regeneratives are people whose bodies ca n't distinguish between health and injury , and so grow extra appendages as well as organs of the opposite sex ; although this is a normal phase for most Muellers at the age of puberty , the bodies of radical regeneratives never outgrow it . After it is discovered that Lanik is a radical regenerative , Lanik 's father must essentially banish him from the kingdom , so as to avoid sending him to the `` pens '' , a place where radical regeneratives are kept in order to harvest their body parts ; exile also functions to get Lanik out of the eye of the Mueller public , as well as to prevent harm from coming to Lanik 's supposed younger brother Dinte . The banishment comes in the form of sending Lanik as an emissary and spy to the Nkumai , a rival nation . Due to his radical regenerative body , Lanik has grown breasts , which makes him appear to be a woman . Using this subterfuge , he poses as an ambassador from the matriarchal nation of Bird in order to discover what the Nkumai are trading in exchange for their abundant metals , which have allowed them to dominate their region militarily . This mission is only the beginning of the adventure for Lanik , who discovers the secrets of the most powerful nations and at the same time gains additional abilities to save his people and determine the fate of his planet . Lanik travels to many of the regions of the planet Treason throughout the book , and discovers that those residing in different regions have different powers or capabilities . He first passes through the land of the Ku Kuei while on his way to Nkumai , learning that they can control the flow of time in a bubble extending out from themselves . When he comes to the land of Schwartz , he discovers that the people there are able to form rock to their will , as well as take energy from the sun . Lanik learns both of these skills and uses them to kill the `` illuders '' from Anderson . The illuders , as Lanik calls them , have the ability to appear to be anything they wish , clouding the minds of those around them to their will . The regions of Treason are named after each of the banished inhabitants . The occupations of the founders are listed ( where known ) .
Rutiodon ( `` Wrinkle tooth '' ) is an extinct genus of archosaur belonging to the family Phytosauridae . It lived during the Late Triassic period , and was about 10 to 25 feet ( 3 to 8 meters ) in length . . The animal is known from fossils in Europe ( Germany and Switzerland ) as well as North America ( Arizona , New Mexico , North Carolina , Texas ) . Like other phytosaurs , Rutiodon strongly resembled a crocodile , but its nostrils were positioned far back on the head , close to the eyes , instead of at the tip of the snout . It had enlarged front teeth , and a relatively narrow jaw , somewhat resembling that of a modern gharial . This suggests that this carnivore probably caught fish and it may also have snatched land animals from the waterside . Also like modern crocodiles , its back , flanks , and tail were covered with bony armored plates . Rutiodon is one of the best-known phytosaurs and appeared in the 2001 Discovery Channel documentary When Dinosaurs Roamed America , shown trying to attack a Coelophysis near the water 's edge and missing . Rutiodon was also featured in episode 6 of Animal Armageddon .
Minimum efficient scale ( MES ) or efficient scale of production is a term used in industrial organization to denote the smallest output that a plant ( or firm ) can produce such that its long run average costs are minimized . Mathematically , the efficient scale can be computed by either taking the first order derivative of the Average Cost ( AC ) and equating it to 0 . This would represent the minimum average cost that the firm is incurring per quantity produced . Another way the efficient scale can be computed is by equating Average Cost ( AC ) with the Marginal Cost ( MC ) . The rationale behind this is that when a firm produces a smaller number of units , its Average Cost per unit is high because a bulk of the costs come from Fixed Costs . As a firm produces more units , the Average Cost incurred per unit will tend to `` average out '' and move towards the cost it takes to produce each additional unit ( Marginal Cost ) . The efficient scale of production is then reached when the Average Cost is the same as its Marginal Cost . This concept is useful in determining the likely market structure of a market . For instance , if the minimum efficient scale is small relative to the overall size of the market ( demand for the good ) , there will be a large number of firms . The firms in this market will be likely to behave in a perfectly competitive manner due to the large number of competitors .

However , issues with the squad and criticism against Palmeiras ' poor performances motivated his resignation three months later .
The 1890 Atlantic hurricane season ran through the summer and the first half of fall in 1890 . The 1890 season was fairly inactive , with only four storms forming . Two became hurricanes , two were tropical storms . However , due to scarce technology and the fact that only storms that affected land or ships were recorded , the actual total could be higher . No hurricanes made landfall in the United States in 1890 . It would n't be till 1990 , 100 years later , that a hurricane , or even a tropical storm did n't make landfall in the United States . The season began unusually early , on May 27 . This storm formed directly below Cuba , and went north across it with 50 mph ( 80 km\/h ) winds . It dissipated soon after leaving Cuban land on May 29 . The season continued with the second storm forming very close to the west coast of the Lesser Antilles on August 18 . It continued west-northwest , and hit near the northeastern tip of the YucatÃ n Peninsula with 50 mph ( 80 km\/h ) winds . It continued north and hit the southeastern part of Louisiana . It continued up into Mississippi , where it dissipated on August 28 . The next storm was first detected on August 26 , possibly forming earlier as a Cape Verde-type hurricane . It formed to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles , and continued northwest . When it got to a position northeast of the Bahamas , it reached a peak of 115 mph winds , turned northwest and headed toward Nova Scotia . It traveled right over the southeastern coast of Nova Scotia , causing ship damage and fatalities . It then continued on its northeast path , and dissipated on September 3 . It caused 9 deaths from a boat sinking . The last storm formed to the east of Nicaragua on October 31 . It traveled west , and hit Nicaragua with 80 mph ( 129 km\/h ) winds .

Villeneuve-sur-Lot ( in the Gascon dialect of Occitan language : VilanuÃ va d'Olt ) is a town and commune in the Lot-et-Garonne department in south-western France . The commune was formerly named Villeneuve-d ` Agen . Villeneuve-sur-Lot is located 22 km northeast of Agen . The town is divided into two unequal portions by the Lot River , which here runs between high banks . Villeneuve was founded in 1254 by Alphonse , count of Poitiers , brother of Louis IX , on the site of the town of Gajac , which had been deserted during the Albigensian Crusade . Pop . ( 1906 ) town , 6978 ; commune , 13,540 . The chief quarter of the town stands on the right bank of the Lot River and is united to the quarter on the left bank by a bridge of the 13th century , the principal arch of which , constructed in the reign of Louis XIII in place of two older arches , has a span of 118 ft. and a height of 59 ft. . On the left bank portions of the 13th century ramparts , altered and surmounted by machicolations in the 1sth century , remain , and high square towers rise above the gates to the north-east and southwest , known respectively as the Porte de Paris and Porte de Pujols . On the right bank boulevards have for the most part taken the place of the ramparts . Arcades of the 13th century surround the Place La Fayette , and old houses of the 13th , 14th and 15th centuries are to be seen in various parts of the town . The church of St Etienne is in late Gothic style . On the left bank of the Lot , 2 m. S.S.W. of Villeneuve , are the 13th-century walls of Pujols . The buildings of the ancient abbey of Eysses , about a mile to the N.E. , which are mainly of the 17th century , serve as a departmental prison and penitentiary settlement . The principal hospital , the hospice St Cyr , is a handsome building standing in beautiful gardens . Villeneuve-sur-Lot is an important agricultural center and has a very large trade in plums ( prunes d'ente ) and in the produce of the market gardens which surround it , as well as in cattle , horses and wine .

Tourrettes-sur-Loup is a commune in the Alpes-Maritimes department in southeastern France . This is an artisan 's village situated near Grasse . It features medieval and romanesque buildings .
Mijoux is a commune and village in the Ain department in eastern France . The village is situated in the upper section of the narrow Valserine valley , nestled between high limestone cliffs to the south-east that form the first anticline of the Jura mountains and the edge of the Lajoux plateau to the northwest . However , only the south-eastern side of the valley is within the commune 's boundary , which stretches from the source of the Valserine river in the north , to the entry into LÃ lex , further down the valley , in the south . The commune is roughly 16 km long and 2 km wide . Despite its high altitude ( just under 1000 m ) , the village is built around a crossroads of regional importance : the valley road ( D991 ) which links Bellegarde-sur-Valserine with Les Rousses here crosses the D936 which links Saint-Claude with Geneva over the Col de la Faucille . Both are former routes nationales . In 1334 the valley was declared common property and revenue was shared between Jean II de Rossillon and Hugues de Joinville , Sire of Gex . The agreement thereby struck up stated that a hospice should be paid for and built within the valley . The hospice was inhabited by monks who were charged with caring for the poorest pilgrims visiting the tombs of the Saints of Condat in Saint-Claude . Most of the pilgrims were from Geneva or Savoy . This was the first building to be inhabited year-round in Mijoux . Because of climate conditions within the valley that meant that winter was harsh and that spring was virtually nonexistent , the valley had remained uninhabited for a long time . However , due to the hospice , houses gradually appeared and work to clear the pines began so as to allow agriculture . At first houses were built along the road that links Lajoux to the Col de la Faucille and it would not be until 1601 at the Treaty of Lyon that the river that bisects the town would become a border : the south-eastern side of the valley became French . In 1612 at the Franco-Spanish treaty , signed in Auxonne , the Valserine was chosen as the border between France and Spain . The north-western side of the valley was ceded to France in 1678 at the Treaties of Nijmegen . At the Treaty of Paris in 1815 , after Napoleon 's downfall , the new border was defined , as it remains today : it passes along Mijoux 's thin northern edge . The French customs , however , were set up along the Valserine as Mijoux , LÃ lex , ChÃ zery-Forens and the Pays de Gex became a pays franc . Today , the Valserine river serves as the border between the regions of Franche-Comt Ã and RhÃ ne-Alpes , Mijoux lying within the latter for its most part . During this time , the valley was inhabited by numerous families , whose jobs changed depending on the season . During the summer , tasks included collecting fodder for the livestock , cultivating barley and potatoesas well as collecting firewood . In winter , when the ground was covered in snow , the same families cut and polished gems . However , the bloodshed of the Great War and the resulting economic crisis contributed to the abandonment of farms and a downturn in poulation levels that left the commune with only half the population it had had 50 years previously . Today and since 1969 , tourism is revitalising this village , mainly due to winter sports . The commune has , for the past 20 years , belonged to the Parc naturel rÃ gional du Haut-Jura . Mijoux 's economy is largely driven by tourism , for the winter sports practiced here . Since 1999 , Mijoux has been part of the Monts Jura ski resort . Ski lifts link Mijoux to the Col de la Faucille at 1308m and to Mont Rond , at an altitude of 1543m above sea level , one of the highest in the Jura Mountains . This part of the ski station is used mostly by downhill skiers . La Vattay , further up the valley but still within Mijoux , is a center for Cross-country skiing .

The Volcano Rabbit also known as teporingo or zacatuche ( Romerolagus diazi ) is a small rabbit that resides in the mountains of Mexico . It is the world 's second smallest rabbit , second only to the Pygmy Rabbit . It has small rounded ears , short legs , and short , thick fur . The Volcano Rabbit lives in groups of 2 to 5 animals in burrows . Unlike many species of rabbits ( and similar to pikas ) , the Volcano Rabbit utters very high-pitched sounds instead of thumping its feet on the ground to warn other rabbits of danger . It is nocturnal and is highly active during twilight , dawn and all times in between . The Volcano Rabbit weighs approximately 390 â `` 600 g ( 14 â `` 21 oz ) . As of 1969 , there were 1000 to 1200 in the wild . The Volcano Rabbit lives in Mexico . The rabbit has been pushed into areas on the slopes of the IztaccÃ huatl , Pelado , Popocatepetl , and Tlaloc volcanoes . The Volcano Rabbit is generally found between elevations of 2800 m and 4250 m in pine forests with a dense undergrowth of bunch grass and rocky terrain called the transverse neovolcanic axis . The Volcano Rabbit feeds on green leaves in zacaton grasses , the undeveloped leaves of spiny herbs and the bark of alder trees . During the rainy season , it will also eat oats and corn from crops . The most serious threats to the Volcano Rabbit are habitat degradation and target shooting . The IUCN\/SSC Lagomorph Specialist Group has created an action plan for this rabbit ( Fa & Bell , 1990 ) . The plan focuses upon the need to manage the burning and overgrazing of the zacaton habitats and to enforce laws prohibiting the capture , sale and hunting of the animal . Studies are recommended into the geographical range , habitat relationships , population dynamics and life history ( Fa & Bell , 1990 ) . In addition , habitat restoration and the establishment of zacaton corridors to link core areas of habitat are needed . Captive breeding colonies exist at Jersey Zoo , UK and Chapultepec Zoo , Mexico City ( Olney & Ellis , 1993 ) .

Rumours that American nuclear weapons under the NATO nuclear sharing program were stationed at Kleine Brogel have never been officially confirmed , but are now known to be true . A cable from the American Embassy in Brussels from Nov. 2009 - published by Wikileaks - not only confirms their existence , but also informs that the Belgian government rejected a proposal from Germany to propose to the rest of NATO that the nuclear weapons be removed from both countries ( as well as those stationed in the Netherlands and Italy ) . Peer has in the summer quite a nice temperature , around 20 degrees celsius . In the winter it normally snows .

For the Reference desk , see Reference desk . A red link , like this one , signifies a link to a page that does not exist in Wikipedia . Sometimes it is useful in editing article text to create a red link to indicate that a page will be created soon or that an article should be created for the topic because it would be notable and verifiable . One study conducted in 2008 showed that red links helped Wikipedia grow . However , rather than using red links in lists , disambiguation pages or templates as an article creation guide , editors are encouraged to write the article first , and instead use the wikiproject or user spaces to keep track of unwritten articles . Articles should not have red links to topics that are unlikely ever to have an article , such as a celebrity 's romantic interest ( who is not a celebrity in his or her own right ) . Red links should not be made to every chapter in a book nor should they be made to deleted articles â '' but one may link to the title of a deleted article if one intends to write an article about an entirely different topic that has the same title . Good red links help Wikipedia -- they encourage new contributors in useful directions , and remind us that Wikipedia is far from finished . A red link appears whenever double brackets are placed around a word or phrase for which Wikipedia does not have an article . Only make links that are relevant to the context . Please do create red links to articles you intend to create , technical terms that deserve more treatment than just a dictionary definition , or topics which should obviously have articles . Keep in mind there are various notability guidelines , which exist for a number of subjects , including people . A red link to a non-notable person can end up being a link to a different person of the same name . Do not create red links to articles that will never be created , including articles that do not comply with Wikipedia 's naming conventions . Note that the illustrative red link created at the beginning of this article is an example of this type of normally unwanted link . Red links are generally not included in either See also sections or in navigational boxes , or pointed with templates such as or , since these navigation aids are intended to help readers find existing articles . The exception is redlinks in navboxes where the articles are part of a series or a whole set , e.g. a navbox listing successive elections , referendums , presidents , sports league seasons , etc. An article should never be left with a non-existent ( redlinked ) category on it . Either the category should be created , or else the link should be removed or changed to a category that does exist . In general , a red link should be allowed to remain in an article if it links to a term that could plausibly sustain an article , but for which there exists no candidate article , or article section , under any name . A red link that links to an article that will plausibly be created in the future , should be left alone rather than create a minimal stub article that has no useful information . For example , the link driving in Germany may be a valid one ( in context ) to be left undealt-with , since an article Driving in the United States exists , and country-specific driving articles like these are a likely category for future creation . However , in the meantime , such a link should not be dealt with by creating a `` placeholder stub '' that says only `` There is driving in Germany '' with the sole purpose of turning validly-linked text from red color to blue . Editors should create stubs with a usable amount of content , or else not create the stub at all . Red links serve a purpose to notify readers that a need exists in Wikipedia for creation of a new article with at least a minimal information content ; the creation of minimalist marker stubs simply to get rid of a red link , destroys this useful mechanism . Likewise , a valid red link term like driving in Germany should also not be dealt with by removing the link brackets , simply in order to temporarily reduce the amount of red text in the article . Using user preferences , a user can format red links so that they instead show up as question marks .

Max Mirnyi ( ; born 6 July 1977 , in Minsk ) is a professional tennis player from Belarus . Today Mirnyi is a doubles specialist but he also enjoyed a good singles career , finishing in the top 50 in the world for 7 straight years as well as representing Belarus in Davis Cup competition since April 1994 , where he holds a record of 47 wins and 27 losses in 35 ties played . He holds seven Grand Slam titles : men 's doubles in the 2000 and 2002 US Open and 2005 and 2006 French Open ; and mixed doubles in the 1998 and 2007 U.S. Opens and 1998 Wimbledon . He earned the nickname `` The Beast '' during his time on tour . Mirnyi has played with a host of different doubles partners , namely forming long-term partnerships with Mahesh Bhupathi , Jonas BjÃ rkman , Lleyton Hewitt , Jamie Murray , and Andy Ram , and short-term partnerships with other top competitors on the doubles tour . In 2003 he reached the doubles final at Wimbledon . On 9 June 2003 , he reached 1st position in ATP Doubles Entry Ranking . In singles , he achieved his career-high ranking of World No. 18 in August 2003 . He became a national hero in Belarus after the Davis Cup 2004 , when he and Vladimir Voltchkov defeated Russia 3 â `` 2 and Argentina 5 â `` 0 , reaching the semifinals where they lost to the United States . For that achievement he was awarded the government 's highest degree medal of honor by the President . Mirnyi was supposed to be the flag bearer of the Belarus national team for the official opening of the 2004 Summer Olympic Games , but Belarusian sport officials changed their minds after they found out that Mirnyi let one Belarusian glamour magazine publish erotic images of himself and his wife . In 2006 , he scored an upset as he took down James Blake 6 â `` 4 3 â `` 6 4 â `` 6 6 â `` 1 6 â `` 0 at Wimbledon . He then lost to his doubles partner Jonas BjÃ rkman 6 â `` 3 7 â `` 6 4 â `` 6 2 â `` 6 6 â `` 3 . BjÃ rkman 's run to the semifinals may have tired him out as BjÃ rkman\/Mirnyi lost to Fabrice Santoro and Nenad ZimonjiÄ in straight sets . In September 2008 Mirnyi completed his studies at the BSU ( Belarus State University ) where he got a degree in International Law . His diploma work was dedicated to International Protection of Children 's Rights .

`` Breakaway '' is a 2004 song co-written by Avril Lavigne , Bridget Benenate and Matthew Gerrard and produced by John Shanks . It was recorded by pop rock singer Kelly Clarkson for the soundtrack to the film The Princess Diaries 2 : Royal Engagement by Disney Records , where it quickly became a charting single and video from the soundtrack . Later , it was included on Clarkson 's second album , Breakaway , being released again by RCA Records as the album 's first single . It was the first single in North America , Latin America and Australia , and the fifth single in Europe and Indonesia , from Clarkson 's second album . In February 2005 , the single was certified gold by RIAA and has sold over 1,413,000 copies in all formats in the US . The song was co-written by Avril Lavigne for her 2002 debut album , Let Go , but she did not release it because she did not feel the song suited her album . It was later recorded by Clarkson for the soundtrack of the 2004 film The Princess Diaries 2 : Royal Engagement . The song was released as a single in the U.S. in July 2004 . After two underperforming singles , `` Low '' and `` The Trouble with Love Is '' , a few critics had written off Clarkson as an American Idol has-been , and neither they nor Clarkson 's management team expected the song to be very successful . Clarkson stated that she recorded the song `` Breakaway '' to tide fans over until September of that year , when her team had been planning the release of the first single from her second album . The situation changed in August 2004 , when `` Breakaway '' entered the Billboard Hot 100 and slowly began to climb it . It gradually became one of the biggest hits of late 2004 , peaking at number six on the Hot 100 in November , becoming Clarkson 's first top ten single since `` Miss Independent '' in 2003 . Because of the slow-burning success of `` Breakaway '' , RCA Records pushed back the release of Clarkson 's next single , moved the release of the album to November and titled it Breakaway to attract fans of the song . `` Breakaway '' is one of the songs with the most longevity on the Hot 100 , not leaving until July 2005 ; this can be partly attributed to its steady digital download sales , which have gained the single a RIAA gold certification . `` Breakaway '' spent a record twenty consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart . The song also shares the record for the longest run at number one for a female artist -- twenty-one weeks -- with CÃ line Dion 's `` A New Day Has Come '' . `` Breakaway '' is the longest running number-one on the chart from a film soundtrack . In Australia , `` Breakaway '' debuted at number fourteen , peaked at number ten on its third week and was later certified gold . The song was extremely popular in Canada and reached number three . It was the fifth single from the album in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom , with a UK release date of June 26 , 2006 . The song became Clarkson 's eighth top forty hit in the UK , peaking at number twenty-two . Because `` Breakaway '' was recorded for The Princess Diaries 2 : Royal Engagement , the music video is tied in with the film . Clarkson wanted the video to be balanced between the theme of the song and the theme of the film . The video includes both themes , starting with a young actress , Lindsey Krueger , representing Clarkson as a child , who can be seen looking forlorn . Years pass , and an adult Clarkson , now a star , is seen attending the fictional premiere of The Princess Diaries 2 : Royal Engagement . Scenes from the film can be seen when Clarkson remembers her past , and how she `` broke away '' . Originally the video was supposed to include more scenes of Clarkson growing up at a more gradual pace , but they had to be eliminated because of time constraints . The music video released in the UK was filmed at the London Hammersmith Apollo when Clarkson toured Europe . Another video was released for the European release of the single ; it is essentially the same as the U.S. video , but with the references to The Princess Diaries 2 : Royal Engagement removed . This version of the video also aired in the U.S. shortly after , as popularity of the movie faded . These are the formats and track listings of major single-releases of `` Breakaway '' .
Cadmium iodide , CdI2 , is a chemical compound of cadmium and iodine . It is notable for its crystal structure , which is typical for compounds of the form MX2 with strong polarization effects . Cadmium iodide is used in lithography , photography , electroplating and the manufacturing of phosphors . Cadmium iodide is prepared by the addition of cadmium metal , or its oxide , hydroxide or carbonate to hydroiodic acid . Also , the compound can be made by heating cadmium with iodine . In cadmium iodide the iodide anions form a hexagonal close packed arrangement while the cadmium cations fill all of the octahedral sites in alternate layers . The resultant structure consists of a layered lattice . This same basic structure is found in many other salts and minerals . Cadmium iodide is mostly ionically bonded but with partial covalent character . Cadmium iodide 's crystal structure is the prototype on which the crystal structures many other compounds can be considered to be based . Compounds with any of the following characteristics tend to adopt the CdI2 structure : MgI2 , TiI2 , VI2 , MnI2 , FeI2 , CoI2 , CaI2 , PdI2 , PbI2 . MgBr2 , TiBr2 , VBr2 , MnBr2 , FeBr2 , CoBr2 . Mg ( OH ) 2 , Ni ( OH ) 2 , Ca ( OH ) 2 . SiTe2 , TiTe2 , CoTe2 , NiTe2 , PdTe2 , PtTe2 . AgF2 , W2C .
Wataru Inoue is a Japanese professional wrestler currently working for New Japan Pro Wrestling . Inoue made his debut in 1999 on the Japanese independent circuit , then climbed the ladder to get to New Japan Pro Wrestling in 2004 . He aligned himself with New Japan Junior Sekigun , a face stable created in order to counteract Jushin Liger 's Control Terrorism Unit in the latter half of 2005 . Within this feud against the CTU , Inoue became known for his physical toughness after surviving a brutal Brainbuster from Fergal Devitt in a tag match with Ryusuke Taguchi and Minoru as their respective partners . And another tag team match against Gedo & Jado where he bled profusely from his eyebrow but still picked up for the submission victory for himself & his mentor Kanemoto . Along with making a name for himself in singles competition , he has also had success in tag team competition with Koji Kanemoto to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team titles in 2005 . Inoue was injured February 2007 and did not return until July of the same year where he & his mentor Koji Kanemoto lost an IWGP Jr. . Tag Team Title Match against Kai En Tai . Inoue was pinned after a Michinoku Driver and was visibly disappointed with his effort , as he realized he had lived up to the `` underachieving loser '' label he had been given . He left New Japan for a learning excursion in Mexico and added strength ( going from 185 to 208 pounds ) and more of a lucharesu\/technical style similar to that of Dean Malenko , who Inoue admired growing up . He returned in November with his sights set on Ryusuke Taguchi and the IWGP Jr. . Heavyweight Title with upgraded versions of his finishing moves at his disposal . The Staggerin ' Blow was now a driver called the `` Oracion Flame '' & switched the roll that started the Triangle Lancer for a leg grapevine that would make it harder for his opponent to reach the ropes . On December 8 , 2007 , Inoue defeated Ryusuke Taguchi to capture his first IWGP Junior Heavyweight title , he defeated Taguchi in a rematch for the title on January 27 , 2008 . He vacated the title on June 16 , 2008 after graduating to the heavyweight division and one day after winning the Best of the Super Juniors Tournament . Since turn heavyweight , Inoue struggled in the division to find some success . In the fall of 2009 Inoue joined Yuji Nagata , Mitsushide Hirasawa and Super Strong Machine to form the stable Blue Justice Army . On May 3 , 2010 , at Wrestling Dontaku 2010 Inoue and Yuji Nagata defeated No Limit ( Yujiro Takahashi and Tetsuya NaitÅ ) and Bad Intentions ( Giant Bernard and Karl Anderson ) in a three-way match to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship . On June 19 Inoue and Nagata lost the Tag Team Championship to Bernard and Anderson in a three-way elimination match , which also included No Limit . In September Mitsushide Hirasawa left for a learning excursion to Puerto Rico and his spot in the Blue Justice Army was given to newcomer King Fale . On October 22 , 2010 , Inoue and Nagata entered the 2010 G1 Climax Tag League . After four wins and a loss , Inoue and Nagata won their block and advanced to the semifinals of the tournament , where , on November 7 , they defeated the IWGP Tag Team Champions , Giant Bernard and Karl Anderson . In the finals of the tournament Inoue and Nagata defeated Tetsuya NaitÅ and Yujiro Takahashi to win the 2010 G1 Climax Tag League . As a result of their victory , Inoue and Nagata received a shot at the IWGP Tag Team Championship on December 11 , 2010 , but were defeated by the defending champions , Bad Intentions .

Ferrier was born in 1910 at Suriname 's largest city and its capital , Paramaribo . A teacher by trade outside political life he assisted in the establishment of the country 's National Party in 1946 , at a time when it was a colony of the Dutch . Ferrier was co-founder of the Boy Scouts van Suriname and its first Chief Scout . At age 16 he was a teacher in the district Saramacca and founded his first Scout Group . This group still exists and now bears the name `` De Johan Ferrier groep , de groep 2 Oranje Dassers '' . Ferrier was a member of the National Council until 1948 . He then went to Amsterdam in the Netherlands to learn education theory . When he went back to Suriname he continued to study and to have a career in education . He served as both prime minister and interior minister for a three-year period from 1955 until 1958 . He also spent time as Suriname 's head of education . From 1968 until 1975 he retained the post of governor . At this stage Suriname was made independent . Ferrier was selected as President of the country . DÃ si Bouterse 's 1980 coup d' Ã tat prompted Ferrier to resign within six months . Ferrier then accompanied his relations to live in the Netherlands . He lived with them in Oegstgeest . His daughter Kathleen ( named after the singer Kathleen Ferrier ) is a member of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands for the Christian Democratic Appeal . In 2005 , Ferrier 's memoirs Last Governor , First President : The Century of Johan Ferrier , Surinamese were published . The Dutch Queen gave him a knighthood . An obituary in national morning daily De Volkskrant said he had claimed : `` Even in the darkest days , I kept my optimism '' . Ferrier died from heart failure while sleeping in his Dutch home at the age of 99 , six months short of his 100th birthday . His body was found early morning on January 4 , 2010 . Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands paid tribute . Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said Ferrier was `` an authoritative and wise statesman '' . Politician and diplomat Jan Pronk paid tribute to his work at uniting divisions . Ferrier was buried on January 11 , 2010 in the Dutch town of Oegstgeest , where he had been living since 1980 . On 12 May 2010 , the day Johan Ferrier would have celebrated his 100th birthday , the Johan Ferrier Fund was officially launched . The Fund strives to follow in his footsteps in supporting Surinamese projects with educational and cultural goals . The Johan Ferrier Fund is an initiative of his daughter Joan Ferrier who first presented the fund in the presence of her father in September 2009 .

Omi was an ancient Japanese hereditary title denoting rank and political standing ( a kabane ) that , along with muraji , was reserved for the most powerful clans during the Kofun period . The omi clans generally took their names from the geographic location from which they originated , such as the Soga ( è æ ` ) , the Kazuraki ( è ` å ) , the Heguri ( å ç 3\/4 ) , the Kose ( å å cents ) , the Kasuga ( æ æ -- ) and the Izumo ( å é ) . By tradition those who held the kabane of omi were considered branches of the imperial line ( ç å æ æ -- , kÅ betsu shizoku ) , and they claimed that they were descendants of Emperor KÅ gen , although there is no historical evidence to support this . Examples of Å omi mentioned in the Nihon Shoki included Kazuraki no Tsubura ( è ` å å ) during the reign of Emperor RichÅ `` , Heguri no Matori ( å ç 3\/4 é é ) during the reign of Emperors YÅ `` ryaku and Seinei , Kose no Ohito ( è å cents ç '' ä ) during the reign of Emperor Keitai and the four generations of Sogas who dominated the title during the 6th and 7th centuries : Soga no Iname , Soga no Umako , Soga no Emishi and Soga no Iruka . When the kabane system was reformed into the eight kabane system in 684 , the powerful omi of the time were given the kabane of ason , which ranked second under the new system , and omi itself was dropped to sixth in rank .
Robert Smith ( November 3 , 1757 -- November 26 , 1842 ) was the second United States Secretary of the Navy from 1801 to 1809 and the sixth United States Secretary of State from 1809 to 1811 . He was the brother of Senator Samuel Smith . Smith was born in Lancaster , Pennsylvania . During the American Revolutionary War , he served in the Continental Army and participated in the Battle of Brandywine . He graduated from Princeton in 1781 and began to practice law in Maryland . Smith became the Presidential Elector in the Electoral College for Maryland in 1789 , then a member of state 's senate from 1793 to 1795 , and finally a member of Maryland 's house of delegates from 1796 to 1800 . President Thomas Jefferson appointed him as Secretary of the Navy in July , 1801 after William Jones declined the position . On March 2 , 1805 , the Senate confirmed the appointments of Smith as United States Attorney General and Jacob Crowninshield as Secretary of the Navy . However , Crowninshield declined his appointment , so Smith briefly served as both Attorney General and Secretary of the Navy . Eventually , President Jefferson appointed John Breckinridge to replace Smith as Attorney General and Smith resumed his role as a full-time Secretary of the Navy . Smith finally left the office of Secretary of the Navy with the end of President Jefferson 's administration on March 4 , 1809 . Jefferson 's successor , President James Madison , immediately appointed Smith as Secretary of State , an office which he held from March 6 , 1809 until his forced resignation on April 1 , 1811 . Smith was closely allied with his brother , Maryland Senator Samuel Smith . He bitterly opposed Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin . Madison thought he could be his own Secretary of State , but Smith so often pursued opposite policies that Madison finally demanded his resignation . In Madison 's April 1811 â Memorandum on Robert Smithâ the president offered a laundry list of Smith 's shortcomings : he questioned Smith 's loyalty ; he found Smith 's diplomatic correspondence wanting ; he had been indiscreet in conversations with the British ; and he had opposed the Administration 's efforts to secure concessions from Britain and France by limiting trade . Apparently Smith was bewildered by these and other charges leveled by Madison and published an exoneration of himself , `` Robert Smith 's Address to the People of the United States , '' an attack on Madison 's foreign policy . Madison offered Smith the post of ambassador to Russia , currently then held by John Quincy Adams . Smith considered the offer , but in the end , he refused the post . ( 1 ) Smith became the president of the not-yet-fully-organized American Bible Society in 1813 . In 1818 , he became the founding president of the Maryland Agriculture Society and afterwards retired to a more private life where he enjoyed his wealth . Robert Smith died in Baltimore , Maryland , on November 26 , 1842 . The USS Robert Smith ( DD-324 ) was named for him .

In mathematics , a unit circle is a circle with a radius of one . Frequently , especially in trigonometry , `` the '' unit circle is the circle of radius one centered at the origin ( 0 , 0 ) in the Cartesian coordinate system in the Euclidean plane . The unit circle is often denoted S1 ; the generalization to higher dimensions is the unit sphere . If ( x , y ) is a point on the unit circle in the first quadrant , then x and y are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle whose hypotenuse has length 1 . Thus , by the Pythagorean theorem , x and y satisfy the equation Since x2 = ( x ) 2 for all x , and since the reflection of any point on the unit circle about the x - or y-axis is also on the unit circle , the above equation holds for all points ( x , y ) on the unit circle , not just those in the first quadrant . One may also use other notions of `` distance '' to define other `` unit circles '' , such as the Riemannian circle ; see the article on mathematical norms for additional examples . The trigonometric functions cosine and sine may be defined on the unit circle as follows . If ( x , y ) is a point of the unit circle , and if the ray from the origin ( 0 , 0 ) to ( x , y ) makes an angle t from the positive x-axis , ( where counterclockwise turning is positive ) , then for any integer k. Triangles constructed on the unit circle can also be used to illustrate the periodicity of the trigonometric functions . First , construct a radius OA from the origin to a point P ( x1 , y1 ) on the unit circle such that an angle t with 0 1,0 ) and line segments PQ OQ . The result is a right triangle Î '' OPQ with â QOP = t. Because PQ has length y1 , OQ length x1 , and OA length 1 , sin ( t ) = y1 and cos ( t ) = x1 . Having established these equivalences , take another radius OR from the origin to a point R ( â ' x1 , y1 ) on the circle such that the same angle t is formed with the negative arm of the x-axis . Now consider a point S ( â ' x1 ,0 ) and line segments RS OS . The result is a right triangle Î '' ORS with â SOR = t. It can hence be seen that , because â ROQ = Ï â ' t , R is at ( cos ( Ï â ' t ) , sin ( Ï â ' t ) ) in the same way that P is at ( cos ( t ) , sin ( t ) ) . The conclusion is that , since ( â ' x1 , y1 ) is the same as ( cos ( Ï â ' t ) , sin ( Ï â ' t ) ) and ( x1 , y1 ) is the same as ( cos ( t ) , sin ( t ) ) , it is true that sin ( t ) = sin ( Ï â ' t ) and â ' cos ( t ) = cos ( Ï â ' t ) . It may be inferred in a similar manner that tan ( Ï â ' t ) = â ' tan ( t ) , since tan ( t ) = y1\/x1 and tan ( Ï â ' t ) = y1 \/ ( â ' x1 ) . A simple demonstration of the above can be seen in the equality sin ( Ï \/ 4 ) = sin ( 3 Ï \/ 4 ) = 1\/sqrt ( 2 ) . When working with right triangles , sine , cosine , and other trigonometric functions only make sense for angle measures more than zero and less than Ï \/ 2 . However , when defined with the unit circle , these functions produce meaningful values for any real-valued angle measure â `` even those greater than 2 Ï . In fact , all six standard trigonometric functions â `` sine , cosine , tangent , cotangent , secant , and cosecant , as well as archaic functions like versine and exsecant â `` can be defined geometrically in terms of a unit circle , as shown at right . Using the unit circle , the values of any trigonometric function for many angles other than those labeled can be calculated without the use of a calculator by using the Sum and Difference Formulas . Complex numbers can be identified with points in the Euclidean plane , namely the number a + bi is identified with the point ( a , b ) . Under this identification , the unit circle is a group under multiplication , called the circle group . This group has important applications in mathematics and science . is a unit circle . It is a simplest case so it is widely used in study of dynamical systems .
`` Starfighter '' is a science fiction term used to describe small , fast , usually one-manned craft designed for armed combat ( cf starship ) . The appearance and use of fictional starfighters is often modeled on fighter aircraft , with little regard for the actual physics of spaceflight . Exceptions include the Gunstar from The Last Starfighter , the Viper from the reimagined series of Battlestar Galactica , and the Starfury from Babylon 5 , which are capable of multidirectional orientation . In some cases , the Starfighters are used as atmospheric fighters as well , explaining their looks . Starfighters are popular as the subjects of flight simulator-like space combat video games , such as the `` Wing Commander '' and `` X-Wing '' series . This connection was made explicitly as early as the 1984 film The Last Starfighter in which a video game on Earth is used as a recruiting device for an alien civilization whose starfighters require the same skills as the video game . In the Star Wars universe , a Starfighter is a blanket term for all small combat space craft , regardless of shields , hyperspace capability , weaponry ( unless it carries none ) , armor , maneuverability and crew . `` Snubfighter '' ( a term first used in Star Wars ) , though no concise definition has been given , often refers to a fighter carrying shielding , secondary weapons systems such as Proton Torpedoes or concussion missiles , and being hyperspace capable . Starfighters sometimes bear mission designations similar to modern fighter aircraft , such as `` strike fighter '' and `` space superiority fighter '' .

LargentiÃ re ( L'Argenti Ã ira in Occitan ) is a commune and sub-prefecture of the ArdÃ che department in the RhÃ ne-Alpes region in southern France . It is located in the narrow valley of the Ligne River , approximately ten kilometres southwest of Aubenas . It claims to be the smallest sub-prefecture in France . Its name , adopted in the thirteenth century in place of its more ancient name Segualeriae ( SÃ gualiÃ res ) , refers to the silver mines in the area between the tenth and fifteenth centuries , when the silver-bearing lead ores in intrusive veins in the LargentiÃ res sandstone were exploited under the authority of the Counts of Toulouse and the Bishops of Viviers , whose title barons de LargentiÃ re was linked to the bishopric . A busy industrial town in the nineteenth century , when it housed silk mills its principal industry is now tourism . Its only railroad station was rased in 1982 , leaving the town accessible only by autoroute . Besides its twelfth - to fifteenth-century chÃ cents teau , the picturesque town conserves its thirteenth-century church , NÃ tre-Dame-des-Pommiers , its Renaissance hÃ tel de ville , its palais de justice , and the Tour ArgentiÃ re that collected the mines ' produce for guarded transport .
Thunder is the sound made by lightning . Depending on the nature of the lightning and distance of the listener , thunder can range from a sharp , loud crack to a long , low rumble ( brontide ) . The sudden increase in pressure and temperature from lightning produces rapid expansion of the air surrounding and within a bolt of lightning . In turn , this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave which produces the sound of thunder , often referred to as a clap , crack , or peal of thunder . The distance of the lightning can be calculated by the listener based on the time interval from when the lightning is seen to when the sound is heard . The cause of thunder has been the subject of centuries of speculation and scientific inquiry . The first recorded theory is attributed to the Greek philosopher Aristotle in the third century BC , and an early speculation was that it was caused by the collision of clouds . Subsequently , numerous other theories have been proposed . By the mid-19th century , the accepted theory was that lightning produced a vacuum . In the 20th century a consensus evolved that thunder must begin with a shock wave in the air due to the sudden thermal expansion of the plasma in the lightning channel . The temperature inside the lightning channel , measured by spectral analysis , varies during its 50 Î 1\/4 s existence , rising sharply from an initial temperature of about 20,000 K to about 30,000 K , then dropping away gradually to about 10,000 K. The average is about 20400 K. This heating causes it to expand outward , plowing into the surrounding cooler air at a speed faster than sound would travel in that cooler air . The outward-moving pulse that results is a shock wave , similar in principle to the shock wave formed by an explosion , or at the front of a supersonic aircraft . More recently , the consensus around the cause of the shock wave has been eroded by the observation that measured overpressures in simulated lightning are greater than what could be achieved by the amount of heating found . Alternative proposals rely on electrodynamic effects of the massive current acting on the plasma in the bolt of lightning . The d in Modern English thunder ( from earlier Old English Ã 3\/4 unor ) is epenthetic , and is now found as well in Modern Dutch donder ( cp Middle Dutch donre , and Old Norse Ã 3\/4 orr , Old Frisian Ã 3\/4 uner , Old High German donar descended from Proto-Germanic \* Ã 3\/4 unraz ) . In Latin the term was tonare `` to thunder '' . The name of the Germanic god Thor comes from the Old Norse word for thunder . The shared Proto-Indo-European root is \* tÃ n-r Ì or \* , also found Gaulish Taranis and Hittite Tarhunt . A flash of lightning , followed after some seconds by a rumble of thunder is , for many people , the first illustration of the fact that sound travels significantly slower than light . Using this difference , one can estimate how far away the bolt of lightning is by timing the interval between seeing the flash and hearing thunder . The speed of sound in dry air is approximately 343 m\/s or 1,127 feet per second or 768 m at 20 Â C ( 68 Â F ) . The speed of light is high enough that it can be taken as infinite in this calculation because of the relatively small distance involved . Therefore , the lightning is approximately one kilometer distant for every 2.9 seconds that elapse between the visible flash and the first sound of thunder ( or one mile for every 4.6 seconds ) . In the same five seconds the light could have traveled the same distance as circling the globe 37 times . Thunder is seldom heard at distances over 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) . A flash of lightning and a simultaneous sharp `` crack '' of thunder , a thundercrack , therefore indicates that the lightning strike was very near .

The Triple Entente ( from French entente `` agreement '' ) was the name given to the alliance among Great Britain , France and Russia after the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente in 1907 . The alliance of the three powers , supplemented by various agreements with Portugal , Japan , the United States , Brazil and Spain , constituted a powerful counterweight to the Triple Alliance of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy . ( Italy had concluded an additional secret agreement with France , effectively nullifying their alliance with Germany . ) Russia had previously been a member of the League of the Three Emperors with Austria-Hungary and Germany , an alliance established in 1873 between Tsar Alexander II , Emperor Franz Joseph I and Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany . The alliance was part of the German Chancellor Otto von Bismark 's plan to isolate France diplomatically ; he feared France had revanchist aspirations and might try to regain her 1871 losses , and to fight against radical sentiments the conservative rulers found unsettling , such as the First International . However , the League faced great difficulty with the growing tensions between the Russian Empire and Austria-Hungary . These tensions revolved mainly over the Balkans where , with the rise of nationalism and the continued decline of the Ottoman Empire , many former Ottoman provinces struggled for independence . The situation in the Balkans ( especially in the wake of the Serbo-Bulgarian War ) and the 1878 Treaty of Berlin , which left Russia feeling cheated of her gains made in the Russo-Turkish War led to the League not being renewed in 1885 . â In an attempt to stop Russia from allying with France , Bismark signed the secret Reinsurance Treaty of 1887 , assuring both parties would remain neutral towards each other should war break out . â Yet despite the treaty , the Russian leadership was alarmed at the country 's diplomatic isolation and entered the Franco-Russian Alliance in 1892 . Due to the alliance between Russia and France , and Bismarck 's exclusion of Russia from the German financial market in 1887 , the treaty was not renewed , ending the alliance between Germany and Russia . The Entente heralded the end of British neutrality in Europe . It was partly a response to growing German antagonism , as expressed in the expansion of the Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial Navy ) into a battle fleet that could threaten British naval supremacy . Ironically , the Franco-Russian Alliance , which had seemed weak during Russia 's defeat in the Russo-Japanese War , later appeared the more powerful alignment , when Russia unexpectedly and rapidly recovered from the defeat and from the Russian Revolution of 1905 , and when Britain was added as a partner . This was not the first time Britain , France , and Russia had co-operated diplomatically . They had done so before during the Greek War of Independence . In the last decade of the nineteenth century , Britain seemed to have adopted a foreign policy of `` splendid isolation '' . Britain 's primary focus was its massive overseas empire . However , by the early 1900s the European theater began to change dramatically . Some in Britain thought it was in need of allies . For most of the nineteenth century , Britain had regarded France and Russia as its two most dangerous rivals but with the apparent threat of German imperialism , British sentiments began to change . In 1907 , the Anglo-Russian Entente was agreed , which attempted to resolve a series of long-running disputes over Persia , Afghanistan and Tibet , as well as helping to address British fears about German expansion in the Near East . In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 , Prussia defeated the Second French Empire , resulting in the establishment of the Third Republic . In the Treaty of Frankfurt ( 1871 ) , Prussia forced France to cede Alsace-Lorraine to the new German Empire . Ever since , relations had been at an all time low . France , worried about the escalating military development of Germany , began building up its own war industries and army as a deterrent to German aggression . As another measure , France developed a strong bond with Russia by joining the Franco-Russian Alliance , which was designed to create a strong counter to the Triple Alliance . France 's main concerns were to protect against an attack from Germany , and to regain Alsace-Lorraine . Russia possessed by far the largest manpower reserves of all the six European powers , but was also the most backward economically . Russia shared France 's worries about Germany . After the Germans started to reorganize the Turkish army , Russia feared that they would come to control the Dardanelles , a vital trade artery which accounted for two fifths of Russia 's exports . This was also coupled with Russia 's long history of rivalry with Austria-Hungary . Austria-Hungary had recently annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina , angering Russia immensely . Russia had considered itself the leader of the Slavic world ( Pan-Slavism ) and viewed the invasion as another step towards annexing Serbia and Montenegro . To counteract Austria-Hungary 's aggression into the Balkans , Russia pledged to aid Serbia militarily if invaded . Russia had also recently fought the grueling Russo-Japanese War in 1905 , resulting in a a revolutionary uprising and transformation into a constitutional monarchy . To counter its enemies militarily and politically , Russia sought to revive the Franco-Russian Alliance . Although it was perceived as useless during the war with Japan , in the European theater it was invaluable . Russia signed the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 with Britain to counter act the threat of the Triple Alliance .

The term spatula is used to refer to various small implements with a broad , flat , flexible blade used to mix , spread and lift materials including foods , drugs , plaster and paints . The term derives from the Latin word for a flat piece of wood or splint ( a diminutive form of the Latin spatha , meaning broadsword ) , hence its use also for the small , flat device , often made of wood , used to depress the tongue during medical examinations of the mouth and throat . The words spade ( digging tool ) and spathe are similarly derived . The word spatula is known to have been used in English since 1525 . Spatulas have a handle long enough to keep the holder 's hand away from what is being lifted , or flipped . The blade often has one side longer than the other . The right side ( as used ) tends to be longer than the left , as this is more effective for right-handed people . Left-handed spatulas exist , but are rare . The blade may be perforated with holes or slots allowing liquids to flow through . The kitchen spatula , also called an egg slice , a `` turner , '' or a flipper is a utensil with a long handle and a broad flat edge , used for lifting and turning fried foods . Kitchen spatulas are usually made of plastic or metal , with a wooden or plastic handle to insulate them from heat . In American English , the word spatula is often used to refer to a scraper . The `` Weird Al '' Yankovic comedy film UHF features an ad for a fictional outlet store called Spatula City that sells nothing but spatulas . The ad features people getting very excited over receiving spatulas , including children at Christmas and wives getting them as romantic gifts .

Stormbreaker is the first novel in the Alex Rider series by British author Anthony Horowitz . It was released in the United Kingdom on 4 September 2000 and in the United States on 21 May 2001 . The book has sold more than nine million copies worldwide . A film adaptation , starring Alex Pettyfer as Alex Rider , was released on 21 July 2006 . A fourteen-year-old boy , Alex Rider , learns of the death of his uncle and adopted parent , Ian Rider , in a deadly car crash . Alex is suspicious ( because he knows that , despite what the police told him after the crash , Ian Rider always wore his seatbelt ) , and decides to investigate . He finds that Ian Rider did not die in a car crash , and was , in fact , a spy who had been killed before completing his mission . He had actually been training Alex ( who already speaks German , Spanish , French , English , Japanese , and is a black-belt in karate ) for a career in MI6 . Alan Blunt and his second-in-command , Mrs Jones , of MI6 , ask Alex to pick up his uncle 's assignment , investigating Herod Sayle , a Lebanese billionaire ( Egyptian in the American version ) who is giving free `` Stormbreaker '' computers to every school in Britain . As an undercover agent , Alex travels to Sayle 's home in Cornwall , and , following the path drawn by his uncle , discovers a large computer manufacturing facility , where the Stormbreaker computers are being tainted with smallpox virus . Before he can communicate with MI6 , however , Alex is caught . Sayle leaves Alex to die in a tank with a Portuguese Man o ' War and heads off to the Science Museum in London , where the Prime Minister is to activate the Stormbreakers , unwittingly releasing the deadly virus . Alex escapes , parachutes out of a hijacked airplane , and smashes through the roof of the Science Museum . With a stolen gun , he fires at the Stormbreakers and Sayle , hitting the Prime Minister in the hand and destroying the trigger that would have released the smallpox . After a debriefing by MI6 , Alex gets into a taxi , intending to head home . The driver is Sayle , who had survived the attack and fled . He pushes Alex to the top of a building , intending to shoot him ; Sayle , however , is himself shot from a helicopter by Yassen Gregorovich , a mysterious assassin who was earlier contracted to kill Ian Rider .

The Leeward Islands ( Ë liË wÉ d Ë aÉ lÉ ndz ) are the northern islands of the Lesser Antilles chain of islands , east of Puerto Rico and running southward to Dominica , being part of the West Indies . They are situated where the northeastern Caribbean Sea meets the western Atlantic Ocean . The southern part of the Lesser Antilles chain is called the Windward Islands . These islands are referred to as `` leeward '' because the prevailing winds in the area blow from the east ( see trade wind ) . Thus these islands are downwind from , or leeward of , the southeasternmost Windward Islands , the group of islands that first meet the trade winds . The Leeward Islands fall under a number of national administrations . There is some active vulcanism within the islands , with a notable eruption in Montserrat in the recent past . Anciently , the islands were inhabited by the Carib people , who gave their name to the Caribbean , and the TaÃ no people . Some descendants of these groups still survive in the islands . The islands were amongst the first parts of the Americas to fall under the control of Spanish Empire . European contact commenced with Christopher Columbus ' second voyage , and many placenames originate from this period , e.g. Montserrat is for Santa Maria de Montserrate , after the Blessed Virgin of the Monastery of Montserrat , which is located on the Mountain of Montserrat , the national shrine of Catalonia . The small and remote Isla Aves may perhaps be included with this group for convenience .

Metre per second ( U.S. spelling : meter per second ) is an SI derived unit of both speed ( scalar ) and velocity ( vector quantity which specifies both magnitude and a specific direction ) , defined by distance in metres divided by time in seconds . The official SI symbolic abbreviation is mÂ sâ ' 1 , or equivalently either m\/s or . Where metres per second are several orders of magnitude too slow to be convenient , such as in astronomical measurements , velocities may be given in kilometres per second , where 1 km\/s is equivalent to 103 metres per second . = 3.6 kmÂ hâ ' 1 ( exactly ) â 3.2808 feet per second ( approximately ) â 2.2369 miles per hour ( approximately ) â 1.9438 knots ( approximately ) 1 foot per second = 0.3048 mÂ sâ ' 1 ( exactly ) 1 mile per hour = 0.44704 mÂ sâ ' 1 ( exactly ) 1 kmÂ h-1 â 0.2778 mÂ sâ ' 1 ( approximately ) â 0.6213 miles per second ( approximately ) â 2237 miles per hour ( approximate ) Although mÂ sâ ' 1 is an SI derived unit , it could be viewed as more fundamental than the metre , since the latter is derived from the speed of light in a vacuum , which is defined as exactly 299 792 458 mÂ sâ ' 1 by the BIPM . It follows that one metre is the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1\/299 792 458 of one second .
The Woolly Flying Squirrel ( Eupetaurus cinereus ) is the sole species placed in the genus Eupetaurus . Until recently scientific knowledge of this rare species was limited to 11 skins collected in the late nineteenth century . However , recent research has confirmed that it is still extant in Pakistani Kashmir . It is the longest member of the family Sciuridae and the most massive gliding animal known , but observations confirm that despite its size , it does glide effectively like other flying squirrels . Eupetaurus has been recorded in northern Pakistan in the area around Gilgit . These areas include Chitral , Astor . Other specimens have been purchased from a bazaar in Tibet , collected in Tibet , and collected in Yunnan , China . Since 1994 , specimens have been captured in the Sai Valley , Gorabad , and Balti Gali , all in northern Pakistan ( Zahler and Woods , 1997 ) . In 2004 , the animal was videotaped by Dinets in Raikot Valley near Nanga Parbat , Pakistan . The preferred habitat appears to be high elevation conifer forests associated with cliffs and caves . The Woolly Flying Squirrel is very large for a flying squirrel ( head and body = 45-60 cm ) . The cheek teeth are unique as they are both flat-crowned and high crowned ( hyposodont ) , setting Eupetaurus apart from other squirrels and suggesting that it feeds on very abrasive plant material , including pine needles ( Zahler and Khan , 2003 ) . The animal has fur that is long and thick , with a grizzled pattern that gives the appearance of a woolly pelage , thus the name . The woolly flying squirrel is unique among the flying squirrels . This is particularly true of its large size and its unique dentition . This led a few early researchers to go so far as to create a distinct family . Some of their arguments were based on poorly drawn and labeled diagrams of the cranium and lower jaw . Zahler and Woods ( 1997 ) suggest instead that Eupetaurus is closely related to another genus of large flying squirrels , Petaurista .

Diego Armando Maradona Sinagra ( born on 20 September 1986 in Naples ) is an Italian footballer and beach soccer player , currently plays for U.S. Arzanese Diego Jr. was a result of an affair between Diego Maradona and a young Neapolitan woman , Cristiana Sinagra . He was brought up by his mother in the Province of Naples . Diego Sinagra had a passion for football and started playing at a young age showing promise by emulating the skills of his father . At eleven years old he was a part of the Napoli youth squad . Diego first met his father in 2003 , in the course of a golf tournament in Rome . Sinagra represented the Italian national team at under-17 age level . In 2004 , the young Diego joined the youth squad of Genoa for a season . His start in first team football came in the amateur leagues during 2005 when he joined Cervia , a team of the Eccellenza division of Emilia-Romagna , which was the subject of a national reality show , named Campioni - Il sogno . He joined Internapoli , from Eccellenza Campania , in January 2006 ; after having been without a team for the first half of the 2005 â `` 06 season , he only played two games for the club as he suffered an injury which kept him sidelined . In 2007 he joined Quarto , another club in the Campanian Eccellenza ; Quarto were victorious in the Eccellenza playoffs that season and were promoted to Serie D. He then agreed to stay at Quarto for the 2007 â `` 08 Serie D season , but left the club by mutual consent on November 16 , 2007 following a head coach replacement which caused him concerns about his role in the team . He then signed for Venafro , a Molisan Serie D team , a few weeks later . On January 21 , 2008 , Maradona scored the first goal with Venafro from 30 metres . At the end of the season Maradona Jr left Venafro and he was bought by a beach soccer team , A.S.D. Mare di Roma . On December 2 , 2008 , he signed for F.C America â `` ( Eccellenza Campania ) .

Iron ( II ) hydroxide or ferrous hydroxide is a compound produced when iron ( II ) ions , from a compound such as iron ( II ) sulfate , react with hydroxide ions . Iron ( II ) hydroxide itself is practically white , but even traces of oxygen impart it with a greenish tinge . If the solution was not deoxygenated and the iron reduced , the precipitate can vary in color starting from green to reddish brown depending on the iron ( III ) content . This precipitate is also known as `` green rust '' in the crystal lattice of which iron ( II ) ions are easily substituted by iron ( III ) ions produced by its progressive oxidation . In the presence of oxygen the color changes quickly . Green rust is a powerful reducing agent and also a layer double hydroxide ( LDH ) capable to sorb anions because of the presence of positive electrical charges borne on its surface . The mineralogical form of green rust is a recently discovered fougerite . All forms of green rust ( including fougerite ) are more complex and variable than the ideal iron ( II ) hydroxide compound . The natural analog of iron ( II ) hydroxide compound is a very rare mineral amakinite , ( Fe , Mg ) ( OH ) 2 . Iron ( II ) hydroxide is poorly soluble ( 1.43 10 3 g\/L ) . It precipitates from the reaction of iron ( II ) sulfate and hydroxide ions ( from a soluble compound containing hydroxide ion ) : It is also easily formed as an undesirable by-product of other reactions , a.o. , in the synthesis of siderite , an iron carbonate ( FeCO3 ) , if the crystal growth conditions are poorly controlled ( reagent concentrations , addition rate , addition order , pH , pCO2 , T , aging time , ... ) . Under anaerobic conditions , the iron ( II ) hydroxide can be oxidized by the protons of water to form iron ( II , III ) oxide and molecular hydrogen . The well crystallized iron ( II , III ) oxide ( Fe3O4 ) is thermodynamically more stable than the iron ( II ) hydroxide . Anions such as selenite and selenate can be easily adsorbed on the positively charged surface of iron ( II ) hydroxide where they are subsequently reduced by Fe2 + . The resulting products are poorly soluble ( Se0 , FeSe , or FeSe2 ) . Iron ( II ) hydroxide has also been investigated as an agent for the removal of toxic selenate and selenite ions from water systems such as wetlands . The iron ( II ) hydroxide reduces these ions to elemental selenium , which is insoluble in water and precipitates out . Note : pKsp = 15.097 where p is the - log and Ksp is the Solubility Product Constant . This means it has a low tendency to dissolve , but is not entirely insoluble . An acidic solution would allow this to disassociate more because the H + would react with the OH - in the compound . In a basic solution iron ( II ) hydroxide is the electrochemically active material of the negative electrode of the nickel-iron battery .
Sagittarius is a constellation of the zodiac , the one containing the galactic center . Its name is Latin for the archer , and its symbol is ( Unicode â ) , a stylized arrow . Sagittarius is commonly represented as a centaur drawing a bow . It lies between Ophiuchus to the west and Capricornus to the east . The constellation 's brighter stars ( from left to right on the map : Ï , Î , Ï , Ï , Î '' , Î , Î , and Î 2 Sagittarii ) form an easily recognizable asterism known as ` the Teapot ' . The stars Î Sgr ( Kaus Media ) , Î Sgr ( Kaus Australis ) , Î Sgr ( Ascella ) , and Ï Sgr form the body of the pot ; Î '' Sgr ( Kaus Borealis ) is the point of the lid ; Î 2 Sgr ( Alnasl ) is the tip of the spout ; and Ï Sgr ( Nunki ) and Ï Sgr the handle . The constellation as a whole is often depicted as having the rough appearance of a stick-figure archer drawing its bow , with the fainter stars providing its horse body . Î Sgr ( Rukbat ) is not the brightest star of the constellation , having a magnitude of only 3.96 ( not shown on the main map as it is located below the map 's southeastern corner , north is up ) . With 20 stars in this constellation known to have planets , Sagittarius has more planetary host stars than any other constellation . The Milky Way as seen from the Earth is at its densest as it passes through Sagittarius , as this is where the galactic center lies . Consequently , Sagittarius contains many star clusters and nebulae . One of the brightest of the star clusters is Messier 55 , about 7.5 Â west of Î Sgr . The constellation contains nebulae such as the Lagoon Nebula ( Messier 8 ) , near Î '' Sagittarii , the Omega Nebula ( Messier 17 ) , also known as the Swan or Horseshoe Nebula , near the border with Scutum ; and the Trifid Nebula ( Messier 20 ) , a large nebula containing some very young , hot stars . The grouping of Lagoon Nebula , Trifid Nebula , and NGC 6559 is often called the Sagittarius triplet . In 1999 a violent outburst at V4641 Sgr was thought to have revealed the location of the closest known black hole to Earth , but later investigation increased its estimated distance by a factor of 15 . The complex radio source Sagittarius A is also here . Astronomers believe that one of its components , known as Sagittarius A \* , is associated with a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy . The Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy is located just outside the Milky Way . The Babylonians identified Sagittarius as the god PabilsaÄ , a strange centaur-like creature firing an arrow from a bow . It is generally depicted with wings , with two heads , one panther head and one human head , as well as a scorpion 's stinger raised above its more conventional horse 's tail . The Sumerian name Pabilsag is composed of two elements - Pabil , meaning ` elder paternal kinsman ' and Sag , meaning ` chief , head ' . The name may thus be translated as the ` Forefather ' or ` Chief Ancestor ' . The sexual potency inherent in this idea may lie behind the common convention of portraying the horse-centaur with an oversize penis . The figure is reminiscent of modern depictions of Sagittarius . In Greek mythology , Sagittarius is identified as a centaur : half human , half horse . In some legends , the Centaur Chiron was the son of Philyra and Saturn , who was said to have changed himself into a horse to escape his jealous wife , Rhea . Chiron was eventually immortalised in the constellation of Centaurus or in some version , Sagittarius . The arrow of this constellation points towards the star Antares , the `` heart of the scorpion . '' As of 2002 , the Sun appears in the constellation Sagittarius from December 18 to January 18 . In tropical astrology , the Sun is considered to be in the sign Sagittarius from November 22 to December 21 , and in sidereal astrology , from December 16 to January 14 .

Carlisle is a rural town in Middlesex County , Massachusetts , United States . According to the 2010 U.S. Census , the population of the town is 4,852 . The area comprising the town of Carlisle was first settled by English colonialists in 1651 when the land was parcels of the neighboring towns of Acton , Billerica , Chelmsford and Concord . Carlisle became a district of Concord in 1780 and was officially incorporated as a town in 1805 . Carlisle contains a library , a country store , a dentist 's office , an automated teller machine and many residential buildings . Kimball Farms , an ice cream store fairly well known in the state of Massachusetts , has one of its four locations in Carlisle . The town newspaper is called the ` Carlisle Mosquito . ' It has been the weekly independent newspaper of the town since 1972 . The paper includes local news , announcements , and logs . Carlisle is located about 8 m south-southwest of Lowell , and 23 m northwest of Boston . It borders the following towns : Concord , Acton , Westford , Chelmsford , Billerica , and Bedford . According to the United States Census Bureau , the town has a total area of 15.5 square miles ( 40.2 kmÂ ) , of which 15.4 square miles ( 39.8 kmÂ ) is land and 0.2 square miles ( 0.4 kmÂ ) ( 1.09 % ) is water . Conservation land makes up about a quarter of the town 's area . Besides town-owned land overseen by the town 's conservation committee , Carlisle is home to Great Brook Farm State Park and a portion of the Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge neighboring the Concord River . Drinking water quality continues to be a major source of concern for residents of Carlisle . The town is geographically situated in an area of extensive wetland , high water table , and extensive ledge , so repair locations are often unavailable when septic systems fail . Voluntary water testing in May 2006 confirmed the presence of Coliform bacteria in four private wells within the town of Carlisle . The town 's Board of Health indicated that one of the wells was located at Ferns Country Store . As a result of these tests , the Town of Carlisle adopted supplementary regulations for sewage disposal in April 2008 . The town said that the action was necessary because Carlisle has no town water backup . When wells are lost to pollution , there is no town water which can be brought in because the town government has no wells of its own . The water at the Carlisle Public School has also been a source of concern since January 2001 , when it was determined that floor drains within the school did not comply with Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection regulations . The school drains made it possible to discharge photographic , art , and science waste materials directly into the septic system , putting groundwater at a high level of risk . The town was also notified of a violation by the Safe Drinking Water Information System ( SDWIS ) in January 2009 because of its failure to sample the water at Carlisle Public School in a timely manner . As of the census of 2000 , there were 4,717 people , 1,618 households , and 1,372 families residing in the town . The population density was 307.1 people per square mile ( 118.6 \/ kmÂ ) . There were 1,655 housing units at an average density of 107.7 \/ sq mi ( 41.6 \/ kmÂ ) . The racial makeup of the town was 93.47 % White , 0.17 % African American , 0.06 % Native American , 4.83 % Asian , 0.04 % Pacific Islander , 0.13 % from other races , and 1.29 % from two or more races . Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.19 % of the population . There were 1,618 households out of which 46.4 % had children under the age of 18 living with them , 78.6 % were married couples living together , 4.7 % had a female householder with no husband present , and 15.2 % were non-families . 11.4 % of all households were made up of individuals and 4.9 % had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older . The average household size was 2.92 and the average family size was 3.18 . In the town , the population was spread out with 30.6 % under the age of 18 , 3.4 % from 18 to 24 , 23.3 % from 25 to 44 , 34.3 % from 45 to 64 , and 8.4 % who were 65 years of age or older . The median age was 42 years . For every 100 females there were 98.3 males . For every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 96.4 males . The median income for a household in the town was $ 129,811 , and the median income for a family was $ 166,641 . The per capita income for the town was $ 75,553 . About 1.5 % of families and 2.4 % of the population were below the poverty line , including 2.6 % of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over . The town is ranked as having the third highest income per capita in Massachusetts , behind Weston and Dover . Carlisle maintains a 2 a zoning law on new development .
A toolbox ( also called tool chest or workbox ) varies with the craft of the owner . The purpose of the toolbox is to organize , carry , and protect the owner 's tools used for trade , hobby or DIY . Modern toolboxes are predominantly metal or plastic . Wood for the construction of toolboxes was the material of choice for boxes built beginning in the early 19th century . After several decades of decline in popularity , today a resurgence in use is underway . Viewed by many as intended primarily for specialized craftsmanship , such as machinist , tool and die makers , jewelers and other specialized craftsmen , they are also sought after by average tradesman and collectors as working heirloom . A modern carpenters ' toolbox is composed of a base , a pivotally-mounted top cover , and usually a rack-mounted inside for convenient access . Many toolboxes , and chests from a variety of trades can be seen at the Smithsonian Museum of American History . one of the best tool boxes for trucks are EDDINS TOOL BOXES made in Stuttgart Arkansas Toolboxes commonly have a hinged cover for a top with a handle for carrying , and one or more latches securing the cover to the box . Open smaller compartments are typically located inside , but larger toolboxes will often have a removable tote tray sitting on a flange inside the lip of the box , with a single larger compartment below . Toolchests sometimes use slide out drawers or cantilever trays in lieu of the voluminous open space of the previously mentioned design . It is less common for these tool storage containers to have a tote tray , although they typically have a hinged top chest storage compartment . Tool chests are primarily made of metal , though some expensive models are made of hardwoods . Often they are sold as a set of a rolling bottom chest with a second , stepped in chest resting above . ( Top Chest ) Although Tool Chests are designed typically with wheels they are not considered portable because of their massive weight and size . Toolcarts ( also known as Rollcabs ) are commonly used in the transportation industry for maintenance and repair of vehicles on location . Used as portable work stations , some of the larger types are self powered and propelled as example in automotive racing Pit Carts . Metal toolboxes ( typically steel ) weigh more than plastic ones . A plastic toolbox laden with tools can weigh the same that a comparable steel box does when empty . Metal boxes are also subject to rusting and their sharp edges can mark the surfaces of things they are banged against . Metal is , however , known for being stronger than plastic , so one should balance its disadvantages against the need to withstand abuse and support the weight of many tools . The simple box with tote tray can be effective , but becomes less so as more tools are added , due to the lack of storage and organizational capabilities . Some toolboxes even have compartments built into the lid for storing supplies such as nails and screws . Yet many tools still must be stored in the compartment below the tote . The large volume of space in this compartment makes this type of box easy to overfill , in terms of both weight and clutter . In addition to the trouble of finding things , there is a risk of heavier items damaging more delicate ones as the toolbox is moved around . A tote tray is a partitioned removable tray used to segregate small tools and items from other compartments . Drawers or cantilever trays minimize these problems . However , drawers increase the weight and thereby reduce the portability of the toolbox . The term toolbox is used in computing to represent a set of subroutines ( or functions ) and global variables . Typically these implement missing functionality using capabilities available in the core software .
A premier is a title for the head of government in some countries and states . In many nations , the title `` premier '' is used interchangeably with `` prime minister '' . In the People 's Republic of China , `` premier '' is more common , but `` prime minister '' is still used ( see Premier of the People 's Republic of China ) . In four of the British overseas territories , ( Bermuda , the Cayman Islands , the Turks and Caicos Islands , and the British Virgin Islands ) , the elected heads of government are styled as `` Premier '' . In other overseas territories the equivalent post is styled as Chief Minister . `` Premier '' is also the title of the heads of government in sub-national entities , such as the provinces and territories of Canada , states of the Commonwealth of Australia , provinces of South Africa , the island of Nevis within the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis , and the nation of Niue . In some of these cases , the formal title remains `` Prime Minister '' but `` Premier '' is used to avoid confusion with the national leader . In these cases , care should be taken not to confuse the title of `` premier '' with `` prime minister '' . In these countries , terms such as `` Federal Premier '' , `` National Premier '' , or `` Premier of the Dominion '' were sometimes used to refer to prime ministers , although these are now obsolete . In Quebec French , the equivalent of the English word `` premier '' is `` premier ministre '' , which is also the word used for `` prime minister '' . New Brunswick , the country 's only bilingual province , likewise uses premier ministre as the French equivalent of premier . In the Czech Republic , `` PremiÃ r '' means the `` Prime Minister '' and the Czech language translates both `` Premier '' and `` Prime Minister '' as `` PremiÃ r '' . In Croatia , the head of government is officially called `` President of the Government '' ( predsjednik vlade ) but `` Premier '' ( premijer ) is commonly used . A premier will normally be a head of government , but is not usually the head of state . In presidential systems , the two roles are often combined into one , whereas in parliamentary systems of government the two are usually kept separate . An example of a nation having separate roles for the premier\/prime minister and the president is the Fifth French Republic . A second in command to a premier is designated as a vice-premier or deputy premier .

The Buzz on Maggie is an American animated television series . It originally aired for 21 episodes between June 2005 and May 2006 . The series focuses on Maggie Pesky , a tween fly , that aspires of becoming a rock star . The series was created by Dave Polsky , one of the writers for Scary Movie 2 and Frank TV . Dave Wasson directed and designed the looks for the characters . The series was the first Disney series to be fully animated in Flash , and it was nominated an Annie Award for its character design . In August 2005 , an artist for the series confirmed that the series had been canceled . The last episode aired on May 27 , 2006 and the series continued to air in reruns until August 2008 . Maggie Pesky is a creative and expressive fly , who has a dream of becoming a famous rock star . She lives in the fly metropolis of Stickyfeet with her parents Chauncey and Frieda , her older brother Aldrin , younger brother Pupert , and her younger sister Bella , whom is still in the stage of a maggot . Throughout the show Maggie is seen to choose the easy way in the tasks she accomplishes , such as cheating on a test or simply being selfish . She is often seen to only care about herself , and puts herself and her needs in front of others . Her best friend Rayna Cartflight helps Maggie to fulfill her dreams . Even though the main story is that Maggie wants to be a rock star , most episodes are about her daily life and the occasions she faces . The series was created by screenwriter Dave Polsky , who is perhaps best known for co-writing the spoof Scary Movie 2 . He executive produced all episodes alongside the director , Dave Wasson . The series was animated in Macromedia Flash at Bardel Entertainment in Vancouver , Canada and at Future Thought Productions in Mumbai , India . It was the first Disney show to be fully animated in Flash . Production of The Buzz on Maggie started in 2004 . Many of the crew members from Â Mucha Lucha ! worked on the show . During an interview with Animation Magazine , Wasson stated that he was influenced by Tex Avery and early Disney shorts when he created the look for the show . He said that The Buzz on Maggie has `` a lot of 1930s touches , '' stating , `` The characters wear white gloves , for example . That 's a direct homage to those classic shorts . '' He chose to animate it in Flash because he `` was convinced it was a good way to go . I had done a few commercials in Flash and a few short films for a museum in Singapore . Wasson and Jorge Gutierrez were both character designers for the series . Gutierrez was nominated for an Annie Award for his character design in the episode `` Bella Con Carny '' . The series ' theme song , `` Just the Way I Am '' was performed by Canadian singer Skye Sweetnam . It was produced and written by Dillon O'Brian and Bob Thiele . The song was nominated for a Daytime Emmy in 2006 for Outstanding Original Song . The series premiered on Friday June 17 , 2005 at 8pm and then began airing at 5:30 pm on weekends . The series also joined the ABC Kids schedule on September 17 , 2005 .

Brecqhou ( or Brechou ; ) is one of the Channel Islands and part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey . It is located just west of Sark and has a surface area of approximately 200 a. Sark claims it as a tenement , and the Ministry of Justice , the department of the United Kingdom government with responsibility for the Channel Islands , considers Brecqhou part of Sark - but this is disputed by Brecqhou 's current tenants . The name Brecqhou derives from the Old Norse brekka ( slope or escarpment ; cf . Bricquebec ) and holmr ( island or islet ; see - hou ) . The island is separated from Sark by an extremely narrow sound ( Le Goulliot Passage ) which , according to legend , has only once been traversed by boat in a high tide . However in reality it is traversed frequently by yachts during each summer and by fishing boats year round and even forms a part of the route taken by occasional powerboating events in the islands . In Sark , the word tenant is used , and often pronounced , as in French in the sense of feudal landholder rather than the common English meaning of lessee . The landholdings of Sark are held by 40 tenants representing the parcels of the 40 families who colonised Sark . As explained on the Sark government website : `` There is no true freehold , all land being held on perpetual lease ( fief ) from the Seigneur , and the 40 properties ( Tenements ) into which the Island is divided ( as well as a few other holdings in perpetual fief ) can only pass by strict rules of inheritance or by sale . '' Of course , the relevance of the Seigneurial privileges and the obligations that distinguish `` feudal '' from `` civil '' landowning has decreased , most of the obligations being connected to agriculture and defense . Since 1929 , the island of Brecqhou is connected to the title of the tenement La Moinerie de Haut , one of the 40 tenements whose owner had to keep a gun for the defense of the fief and , until 2008 , had a seat in Chief Pleas . Originally , La Moinerie de Haut , named after the medieval monastery whose site is close to it , was a parcel of land in the north west of Sark that was , at that time , owned by the Seigneur himself . When Sibyl Hathaway sold the island of Brecqhou to Angelo Clarke in 1929 , she transferred the seat in Chief Pleas connected to this parcel to Brecqhou . This was no greater loss for her , as she owned more than one tenement and every member of Chief Pleas was entitled to only one vote . Since 1993 the tenement of Brecqhou has been owned by the Barclay brothers , the co-owners of The Daily Telegraph newspaper and former co-owners of The Scotsman . Under the Reform ( Sark ) Law 1951 , the tenant is David Barclay . Since the purchase the Barclays have been in several legal disputes with the government of Sark , and have expressed a desire to make Brecqhou politically independent from Sark . They drive cars on the island , and have a helicopter , both of which are banned under Sark law . The rule of Sark over Brecqhou is formally based on the retention of Seigneurial rights included in the contract of sale constituting the change in ownership from the Dame of Sark , Sibyl Hathaway , to Angelo Clarke in 1929 . According to the Barclays , this retention is invalid , as Brecqhou was never part of the fief of Sark . They argue that letters patent establishing the fief does not mention the smaller island . While the Seigneur eventually came into the ownership of Brecqhou ( not before 1681 ) , the island was not merged into the fief . Therefore , in respect of Brecqhou , the Seigneurs never held the privileges valid in the fief of Sark , but lost any title to Brecqhou on reselling the island to Clarke . The conflict caused a lawsuit ( 1996 â `` 2000 ) and the founding of a Brecqhou relationship sub-committee of Sark 's Chief Pleas ( 2006 ) . The former tenant , Leonard Joseph Matchan , had devised a personal flag ( identical to the Sark flag , with the exception that the Matchan arms was emblazoned on the bottom right ) . Although frequently considered the island flag , this was only a personal flag , and is not in use any more . Leonard Joseph Matchan had issued stamps in 1969 . Matchan occupied Brecqhou until his death on October 6 , 1987 . The current tenants have issued postage stamps annually since 1999 .

Plaridelâ s ideology of truth , fairness and impartiality is anchored on democratic principles , as these are the bastions of a society acceptable to all Filipinos . Slut or slattern has been used in the past primarily as a pejorative term meaning an individual who is sexually promiscuous . The term is generally applied to women and was an insult or offensive term of disparagement , meaning `` dirty or slovenly . '' Although the ultimate origin of slut is unknown , it first appeared in Middle English in 1402 as slutte ( AHD ) , with the meaning `` a dirty , untidy , or slovenly woman . '' Even earlier , Geoffrey Chaucer used the word sluttish ( c. 1386 ) to describe a slovenly man ; however , later uses appear almost exclusively associated with women . The modern sense of `` a sexually promiscuous woman '' dates to at least 1450 . Another early meaning was `` kitchen maid or drudge '' ( c. 1450 ) , a meaning retained as late as the 18th century , when hard knots of dough found in bread were referred to as `` slut 's pennies . '' A notable example of this use is Samuel Pepys 's diary description of his servant girl as `` an admirable slut '' who `` pleases us mightily , doing more service than both the others and deserves wages better '' ( February 1664 ) . In the 19th century , the word was used as a euphemism in place of `` bitch '' in the sense of a female dog . Similar words appear in Dutch , German and Swedish dialects meaning `` a dirty woman , '' indicating a common ancestor in Germanic languages . The word entered the colloquial Yiddish as `` akhsluttishkha '' meaning `` a hag '' . It exists in Ukrainian too as slutyj as a loan word from Yiddish or via the mediaeval Scandinavian Varangian colonists in Kievan Rus ' . A popular theory connects slut to earlier Germanic forms meaning `` slush '' or `` mud puddle , '' but this derivation remains in question . The accepted denotative meaning is a sexually promiscuous woman or `` a woman of a low or loose character ; a bold or impudent girl ; a hussy , jade . '' These definitions identify a slut as a person of low character -- a person who lacks the ability or chooses not to exercise a power of discernment to order their affairs , such as a cad , rake , or womanizer . The adjective `` slutty '' carries a similar connotation but can be applied both to people and to clothing and accessories , such as Halloween costumes . The term slut has therefore frequently been used as an insult . The derogatory power of the term derives both from its denotative meaning of a promiscuous woman , but also from its historical and regional connotations or alternate meanings that identify a slut as a dirty or unkempt person . These additional meanings and connotations are negative and identify a slut as being a slovenly and ugly person , for example as in these quotations from OED2 : Hearne , 1715 : `` Nor was she a Woman of any Beauty , but was a nasty Slut . '' Shenstone , 1765 : `` She 's ugly , she 's old , ... And a slut , and a scold . '' Saturday Review ( London ) , 1862 : `` There are a good many slut-holes in London to rake out . '' The British journalist Katharine Whitehorn wrote a famous 1963 article applying this meaning in The Observer : `` Have you ever taken anything out of the dirty-clothes basket because it had become , relatively , the cleaner thing ? Changed stockings in a taxi ? Could you try on clothes in any shop , any time , without worrying about your underclothes ? How many things are in the wrong roomâ '' cups in the study , boots in the kitchen ? ... ( this makes ) you one of us : the miserable , optimistic , misunderstood race of sluts . '' This article prompted a flurry of correspondence , with many women writing in to describe their own acts of sluttishness . Recent times have seen alternate slang usages of the word slut . It is often used describing some gay males and bisexuals , comparing them as people who are promiscuous in that they have , or are reputed to have , many sexual partners , or whose sexuality is voracious or indiscriminate . Slut is also used as a slang term in the BDSM , polyamorous , and gay and bisexual communities . With BDSM , polyamorous , and non-monogamous people , in usage taken from the book The Ethical Slut , the term has been used as an expression of choice to openly have multiple partners , and revel in that choice : `` a slut is a person of any gender who has the courage to lead life according to the radical proposition that sex is nice and pleasure is good for you . '' A slut is a person who has taken control of their sexuality and has sex with whomever they choose , regardless of religious or social pressures or conventions to conform to a straight-laced monogamous lifestyle committed to one partner for life . The term has been `` taken back '' to express the rejection of the concept that government , society , or religion may judge or control one 's personal liberties , and the right to control one 's own sexuality .
The Vancouver Grizzlies were a National Basketball Association ( NBA ) team based in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada . The Grizzlies were part of the NBA 's 1995 expansion into Canada , but poor attendance ( largely due to the team 's poor play ) caused the franchise to move to the United States ; the team currently is known as the Memphis Grizzlies . The Grizzlies , along with the Toronto Raptors , entered the NBA as an expansion franchise in 1995 . Both teams were the first to play in Canada since the 1946 -- 47 Toronto Huskies . The Grizzlies were originally supposed to be named the Vancouver Mounties , but were forced to find a new name due to objections from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police . They then decided to adopt the name `` Grizzlies , '' after the grizzly bear , which is native to British Columbia . Like the Raptors , the Grizzlies paid homage to the sport 's founder , Canadian James Naismith , in their color scheme ; one of their team colors was `` Naismith blue . '' The newly built General Motors Place ( now Rogers Arena ) , shared with the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) , would serve as the Grizzlies ' home arena for their entire stay in Vancouver . The Grizzlies were initially composed of players taken from other teams via an expansion draft , together with the team 's first draft pick , center Bryant Reeves . However , they were hampered by the NBA 's decision to deny the Raptors and Grizzlies a shot at one of the top five picks in the draft . The other owners were still stung by the Orlando Magic making the NBA Finals in only their sixth year of existence largely on the strength of getting Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway with consecutive top picks . Although they won their first two games in franchise history , the Grizzlies finished with the worst win\/loss record in the 1995 -- 96 season , as is typical for an expansion team , and lost 23 straight games from February to April ( setting what was an NBA single-season record ; the record of 26 is now held by the Cleveland Cavaliers ) . In 1996 , the Grizzlies drafted Shareef Abdur-Rahim as the third overall pick . However , they continued to struggle and finished with the worst record in the league . In 1997 , the Grizzlies drafted Antonio Daniels with the fourth pick . Still , they finished in last place and repeated this feat again in the 1998 -- 99 season , despite drafting guard Mike Bibby with the second overall pick in the NBA Draft . In the lockout-shortened season that followed , the Grizzlies would only win eight games . In the 1999 NBA Draft , the Grizzlies had the second overall pick again , and selected Steve Francis . Unfortunately , in what became a turning point for the franchise , Francis publicly announced that he did not want to play for the team , citing various reasons . He was heavily criticized for his antics , particularly in Vancouver , and was subsequently traded to the Houston Rockets in a three-team , 11-player blockbuster deal . After the NBA lockout , attendance at Grizzlies games began to drop slightly , and the team 's owners , Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment ( who also owned the Canucks ) , began to lose money . The NBA rejected an initial sale of the team to Bill Laurie ( who at that time owned the St. Louis Blues of the NHL ) after Laurie openly stated that he would move the team to St. Louis , Missouri . Businessman Michael Heisley then bought the team in 2000 with a promise to keep the Grizzlies in Vancouver . However , attendance at Grizzlies ' home games dropped slightly in the 2000 -- 01 season . Fan support increased after it was widely believed that the team would be moved before the next season . Mike Bibby is the last remaining active NBA player to have played for the Grizzlies while still in Vancouver .

In 2002 , the club 's shares were sold to Saba Battery Co. ( also known as Niru Co. ) which is under the control of Iran 's Ministry of Defense . Due to the club 's greatly improved financial status , the team was able to purchase talented players and was promoted to the IPL after only two years . The team debuted in the IPL 2005\/06 season . The football team was able to secure a berth for the Asian Champions League after winning the 2005 Hazfi Cup , however failed to make it past the group stages . In 2008 Saba was moved to Qom because the city of Tehran has many football teams that have low attendance figures . They were one of the few teams of the league in 2008-09 season which had one coach during the season and finished in 6th position at the end of the season something that happened again in the next season .

N ` Gotty originally rejected Bolton 's loan offer , but later agreed to spend the rest of the season with the club . The move eventually became a permanent deal .

The National Basketball Association staged its first All-Star Game in the Boston Garden on March 2 , 1951 . From that year on , the game has matched the best players in the Eastern Conference with the best players in the Western Conference . The participants are currently chosen in two ways . The first is via fan ballot , with the leading vote recipients at each position starting the game ; secondly the reserves are chosen by a vote among the head coaches of each squad 's particular conference . Coaches are not allowed to vote for their own players . If a player is injured and can not participate , the commissioner will select a replacement . The coach of the team with the best record in each conference on January 31 is chosen as the coach of the respective conference in the All-Star Game . However , regardless of record , a coach can not be made an All-Star in two consecutive seasons . This is the so-called `` Riley Rule '' so named because coach Pat Riley 's Lakers teams of the 1980s won so often that he coached the Western Conference team eight times in nine seasons from 1982 to 1990 . In the event that a coach 's team repeats as the best record holder the coach from the team with the second best record will serve as All-Star coach for that conference . The All-Star Game is played under normal NBA rules , but there are notable differences from an average game . Since the starting All-Stars are selected by fan vote , players sometimes start the game at atypical positions . For instance , in 2007 Kobe Bryant and Tracy McGrady had the two highest fan vote totals among Western Conference guards . As both players normally play shooting guard , Bryant , who is 6 ' 6 '' ( 198 cm ) , started the game as a point guard , despite him also manning the shooting guard position on his team . The player introductions are usually accompanied by a significant amount of fanfare , including lighting effects , dance music , and pyrotechnics . Special uniforms are designed for the game each year , usually red for the Western Conference and blue for the Eastern Conference , but the 1997 â `` 2002 games allowed players the opportunity to wear their respective team uniforms . A major recording artist typically sings `` O Canada '' and `` The Star-Spangled Banner '' prior to tipoff . One of the more memorable performances was given by Marvin Gaye during the 1983 game . Gaye was accompanied by Gordon Banks , who played a tape from an all night session that used numerous elements of soul music and funk . Banks still has that historic tape of the music to which Gaye sang his soulful version . Gameplay usually involves players attempting spectacular slam dunks and alley oops . Defensive effort is usually limited and the final score of the game is generally much higher than an average NBA game . The coaches also try to give most of the reserve players some time on the court instead of using a limited rotation as they would in a normal game . The fourth quarter of the game is often played in a more competitive fashion , if the game is close . Halftime is also longer than a typical NBA game due to musical performances by popular artists . Recent guests have included Elton John , BeyoncÃ , Mariah Carey , OutKast , Alicia Keys , Shakira , John Legend and Rihanna . The Eastern Conference All-Stars lead the all-time series 36 â `` 24 . The All-Star Game is the featured event of All-Star Weekend , and it is held on a Sunday night . All-Star Weekend also includes a number of popular exhibition games and competitions featuring NBA players and alumni as well as players from the WNBA and D-League .

The instrumental portions of the song at the beginning and the end which feature a bass drum beat reminiscent of a heartbeat are used in the opening theme . It was also used in the television commercial for the game Assassin 's Creed . The song 's music video featured a plastic foetus in the womb , lip-synching the song . It was directed by Walter Stern . The single peaked at # 16 in Australia . It placed number 22 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time in 2009 , and number 23 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 1998 , the year of its release . Robert Del Naja stated in a 2010 interview on The Hour that Elizabeth Fraser wrote the song about Jeff Buckley , of whom she had been a great friend . The 12 '' release contains the same songs but in a different order . The cassette release contains an edited version of the original song , as well as the Scream Team remix and the B-side `` Euro Zero Zero '' , but is missing the remix by Mad Professor . Newton Faulkner covered the song on his album Hand Built by Robots . On downloads alone , Faulkner 's version reached # 60 in the UK Singles Chart in August 2007 . It was released as an official single on 10 December 2007 , and reached # 57 on the chart the following week . The version of the album available from the Australian iTunes Music Store also incorporates an acoustic version . JosÃ GonzÃ lez covered `` Teardrop '' in his second album In Our Nature . The single was released across Europe on 12 November 2007 . The single features the non-album instrumental B-side `` Four Forks Ache . '' This version was also featured in the medical drama House , M.D. in the episode Wilson 's Heart . Civil Twilight covered `` Teardrop '' on their April 13 , 2010 release `` Live from SoHo '' , an iTunes-only release . The band , signed to Wind-Up Records , released the studio version of the song as a single on August 10 , 2010 .

The Edinburgh International Festival is a festival of performing arts that takes place in the city of Edinburgh , Scotland , over three weeks from around the middle of August . By invitation from the Festival Director , the International Festival brings top class performers of music ( especially classical music ) , theater , opera and dance from around the world to perform . The festival also hosts a series of visual art exhibitions , talks and workshops . The first International Festival ( and the first Fringe , the Edinburgh Festival Fringe , although it was n't known as such until the following year ) took place between August 22 and September 11 1947 , in the wake of the end of the Second World War , with an optimistic remit to ` provide a platform for the flowering of the human spirit ' and enrich the cultural life of Scotland , Britain and Europe . The founders of the Festival included Rudolf Bing , ( then the General Manager of Glyndebourne Opera Festival ) , Henry Harvey Wood the Head of the British Council in Scotland , Sidney Newman , Reid Professor of Music at Edinburgh University , and a group of civic leaders from the City of Edinburgh , in particular the Lord Provost Sir John Falconer . Bing , the moving spirit behind the enterprise , had looked at several English cities before settling on Edinburgh . The Festival has since taken place every August . In 1999 , the Edinburgh International Festival moved to a permanent home in The Hub , formerly ` The Highland Tolbooth ' - an architecturally remarkable building a couple of minutes ' walk from Edinburgh Castle , originally built as an assembly house for the Church of Scotland . Its gothic spire is the highest point in central Edinburgh , and can be seen for many miles around . The Festival aims to cover its costs every year . The total budget for the 2004 Festival was Â # 6.8 million , covered by a combination of ticket sales ( 27 % ) and other earned income - broadcast fees , publications and so on ( 4 % ) ; sponsorship & donations ( 27 % ) ; and public grants ( 42 % , mostly from the City of Edinburgh Council ) . Almost 335,000 people attended EIF events in 2004 . 60 % of these were Scottish , another 26 % came from the rest of Britain , 14 % came from overseas . Besides the performances during the Festival itself , a range of education and outreach workshops , talks and lectures take place throughout the year . About ten other festivals are held in Edinburgh at about the same time as the International Festival . Collectively , the entire group is referred to as the Edinburgh Festival . Most notable of these is the Edinburgh Fringe , which started as an offshoot of the International Festival and has since grown to be the world 's largest arts festival .

The Paris Peace Conference ( July 29 to October 15 , 1946 ) resulted in the Paris Peace Treaties signed on February 10 , 1947 . The victorious wartime Allied powers ( principally the USA , USSR , UK , France and Canada ) negotiated the details of treaties with Italy , Romania , Hungary , Bulgaria , and Finland ( see the List of countries involved in World War II ) . The treaties allowed Italy , Romania , Hungary , Bulgaria , and Finland to reassume their responsibilities as sovereign states in international affairs and to qualify for membership in the United Nations . The settlement elaborated in the peace treaties included payment of war reparations , commitment to minority rights and territorial adjustments including the end of the Italian Colonial Empire in Africa and changes to the Italianâ `` Yugoslav , Hungarianâ `` Slovak , Romanianâ `` Hungarian , Sovietâ `` Romanian , Bulgarianâ `` Romanian , Frenchâ `` Italian and Sovietâ `` Finnish frontiers . The political clauses stipulated that the signatory should `` take all measures necessary to secure to all persons under ( its ) jurisdiction , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion , the enjoyment of human rights and of the fundamental freedoms , including freedom of expression , of press and publication , of religious worship , of political opinion and of public meeting . '' No penalties were to be visited on nationals because of wartime partisanship for the Allies . Each government undertook measures to prevent the resurgence of fascist organizations or any others `` whether political , military or semi-military , whose purpose it is to deprive the people of their democratic rights '' . Particularly in Finland , the reparations and the dictated border adjustment were perceived as a major injustice and a betrayal by the Western Powers , after the sympathy Finland had received from the West during the Soviet-initiated Winter War of 1939 â `` 1940 . However , this sympathy had been eroded by Finland 's cooperation with Nazi Germany during its war against the Soviet Union . During this time Finland not only recaptured territory lost in 1940 , but continued its offensive deeper into the Soviet Union , occupying a broad strip of Soviet territory . This prompted the United Kingdom to declare war on Finland in November 1941 , further weakening political support in the West for the country . The Soviet Union 's accessions of Finnish territory were based on the Moscow Armistice signed in Moscow on September 19 , 1944 and resulted in an extension of the accessions in the Moscow Peace Treaty ( 1940 ) that ended the Winter War . The war reparation problem proved to be one of the most difficult arising from post-war conditions . The Soviet Union , the country most heavily ravaged by the war , felt entitled to the maximum amounts possible , with the exception of Bulgaria , which was perceived as being the most sympathetic of the former enemy states . In the cases of Romania and Hungary , the reparation terms as set forth in their armistices were relatively high and were not revised . Finland is the only country listed which has fully paid war reparations . Romania ultimately paid about 2 billion USD in goods and money , six times more than the amount stated in the treaty . Romania was under Soviet occupation until 1958 . The collapse of the Soviet Union has not led to any formal revision of the Paris Peace Treaties .
Masanaga Kageyama ( born 23 May 1967 ) is a former Japanese football player .
Gert Engels ( born 26 April 1957 ) is a former German football ( soccer ) player and coach . He commenced his professional playing career with lowly SG DÃ 1\/4 ren 99 and later joined Borussia MÃ nchengladbach and FC Niederau . In MÃ nchengladbach he was part of the team that won the German Championships of 1976 and 1977 , but Engels was not used in any league matches . In 1990 he moved to Japan to work as a coach . His first stop was in Ibaraki with Prima Aseno FC , the club that later became Mito HollyHock . He also coached at Takigawa Dai Ni High School in Kobe before he joined the Yokohama FlÃ 1\/4 gels as a member of the coaching staff in 1993 . Shortly before the Flugels folded and were partly absorbed into today 's Yokohama F. Marinos ( some of the players joined Yokohama Marinos , and the F was added in remembrance of Flugels ) he was made manager there for a brief period . He held that position also briefly with JEF United Ichihara Chiba before taking over the reins at Kyoto Purple Sanga . In Kyoto he returned the club , that was relegated after the previous season , into the J-League Division 1 and even led it to a win in the Japanese cup competition , the Emperor 's Cup in 2002 , defeating the fancied Kashima Antlers 2-1 in extra time . After three years there he was fired when the club started poorly into the new season . At the start of 2004 he was assistant coach with Urawa Red Diamonds , initially under Guido Buchwald and later Holger Osieck , winning the AFC Champions League in 2007 . When Osieck was sacked after only two matches of the new J. League season on March 16 , 2008 , Engels was appointed his successor . He was fired by Urawa Reds ( the team having dropped the `` Diamonds '' officially by now ) on 26 November 2008 .
He played during the 1998 World Cup in France . Carlos Germano Schwambach Neto ( born 14 August 1970 ) , better known as Carlos Germano , is a former Brazilian football goalkeeper . He was a member of the Brazilian squad for France 98 World Cup . He began his football career in 1985 in his native town , and was discovered by Vasco 's manager who proposed that he join the youth team for a test . In the same year he became the first choice goalkeeper for the youth side . When Vasco 's senior goalkeeper AcÃ cio left the club , Carlos Germano became the number 1 immediately . He went to receive all of the club honors and was chosen top goalkeeper of the Brazilian Championship in 1997 . In 1999 he had some disagreements with Vasco 's chairman and left the club . He signed with Santos FC in 2000 for four years , but one year later the club could n't pay the total amount of the contract and he obtained the right to a free transfer , moving to Portuguesa-SP . From then on , he signed one year contracts with different clubs , including his first club ( Vasco ) , until he signed with FC Penafiel ( Portuguese side at the time in the second division ) in 2005 . In 1988 , he was chosen as Brazil 's goalkeeper in the South American under-20 championship .

The phenomenon known as planetshine occurs when reflected sunlight from a planet illuminates the night side of one of its moons . Typically , this results in the moon 's night side being bathed in a soft , faint light . The best known example of planetshine is earthshine , which can be seen from Earth when the Moon is a thin crescent . Planetshine has been observed elsewhere in the solar system : in particular , it has recently been used by the Cassini space probe to image portions of the moons of Saturn even when they are not lit by the Sun . Earthshine is reflected earthlight visible on the Moon 's night side . It is also known as the Moon 's ashen glow or as the old Moon in the new Moon 's arms . Earthshine is most readily observable shortly before and after a New Moon , during the waxing or waning crescent phase . When the Moon is new as viewed from Earth , the Earth is nearly fully lit up as viewed from the Moon . Sunlight is reflected from the Earth to the night side of the Moon . The night side appears to glow faintly and the entire orb of the Moon is dimly visible . Leonardo da Vinci explained the phenomenon in the early 16th century when he realized that both Earth and the Moon reflect sunlight . Light is reflected from the Earth to the Moon and back to the Earth as earthshine . Earthshine is used to help determine the current albedo of the Earth . The data are used to analyze global cloud cover - a climate factor . Oceans reflect the least amount of light , roughly 10 % . Land reflects anywhere from 10-25 % of the Sun 's light , and clouds reflect around 50 % . So , the part of the Earth where it is daytime and from which the Moon is visible determines how bright the Moon 's earthshine appears at any given time . Studies of earthshine can be used to show how the Earth 's cloud cover varies over time . Preliminary results show a 6.5 % dip in cloud cover between 1985 and 1997 and a corresponding increase between 1997 and 2003 . This has implications for climate research , especially with regards to global warming . Some clouds have a net warming effect because they trap heat , while others have a net cooling effect because they increase albedo , so the overall effect on global temperature remains unclear .

Scientists at NASA 's Navigator Program , which specializes in the detection of terrestrial planets , have backed the launch of a Terrestrial Planet Finder ( TPF ) mission . TPF would detect planetshine from planets orbiting stars to investigate whether they could harbor life . It would use advanced telescope technologies to look for life-marks in the light reflected from the planets , including water , oxygen and methane . The European Space Agency has a similar mission , named Darwin , under consideration . This will also study the earthshine of planets to detect the signatures of life . Unlike many traditional astronomical challenges , the most serious challenge for these missions is not gathering enough photons from the faint planet , but rather detecting a faint planet that is extremely close to a very bright star . For a terrestrial planet , the contrast ratio of planet to its host stars is approximately ~ 10 â ' 6-10 â ' 7 in the thermal infrared or ~ 10 â ' 9-10 â 10 in the optical\/near infrared . For this reason , Darwin and Terrestrial Planet Finder-I will work in the thermal infrared . However , searching for terrestrial planets in the optical\/near infrared has the advantage that the diffraction limit corresponds to a smaller angle for a given size telescope . Therefore , NASA is also pursuing an Terrestrial Planet Finder-C mission that will search for and study terrestrial planets using the optical ( and near infrared ) wavelengths . While Terrestrial Planet Finder-C aims to study the planetshine of extrasolar planets , Darwin and Terrestrial Planet Finder-I will search for thermal infrared light that is reradiated ( rather than scattered ) by the planet , and most astronomers would not consider that to be planetshine . In preparation for these missions , astronomers have performed detailed earthshine observations . Astronomers have paid particular attention to whether earthshine measurement can detect the red edge , a spectral feature that is due to the plants . The detection of a similar spectral feature in light from an extrasolar planet would be particularly interesting , since it might be due to a light-harvesting organism . While the red edge is almost certainly the easiest way to directly detect life on earth via earthshine observations , it could be extremely difficult to interpret a similar feature due to life on another planet , since the wavelength of the spectral feature is not known in advance ( unlike most atomic or molecular spectral features ) .
Tony `` Demolition '' Dolan ( also known as The Demolition Man ) is an English musician and actor , most known as bassist and vocalist of heavy metal bands Atomkraft and Venom . Dolan and Paul Spillett formed Atomkraft in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1979 . Dolan was a vocalist from 1979 to 1986 , played guitars from 1979 to 1981 and on 1988 , just before they broke up . From 1981 to 1987 he played bass guitar . When Atomkraft was reformed in 2004 , Dolan took up the duty of vocalist and bassist again . In 1988 , he was offered a role of bassist\/vocalist for the prominent band Venom . He recorded four albums with Venom before leaving the band in 1993 . He also participated in many musical acts , like Mantas , Dogmatix , Raubtier etc. In 2010 , Dolan , along with Jeffrey Dunn and Anthony Lant , started playing bass guitar and singing in Primevil .
North Ayrshire is one of 32 council areas of Scotland . It is headquartered at Cunninghame House in Irvine . The area was created in 1996 as a successor to the district of Cunninghame which covered exactly the same boundaries . The mainland portion of the council area has historically been part of a greater County of Ayr , however it also contains the islands of Arran , Great Cumbrae and Little Cumbrae in the lower Firth of Clyde . All the islands were previously in the County of Bute . North Ayrshire borders onto the areas of Inverclyde to the north , Renfrewshire to the north east , and East Ayrshire and South Ayrshire to the East and South respectively . The main administration center and largest settlement in North Ayrshire is Irvine , a new town on the coast of the Firth of Clyde , with a population of 39,527 . Other major population centres include Largs , and the Three Towns - Ardrossan , Saltcoats and Stevenston . On the Isle of Arran , the largest town is Lamlash and there are numerous smaller villages . On Great Cumbrae , the main town is Millport .
Tux Racer is a Free Software 3D computer game starring the Linux mascot , Tux the penguin . In the game , the player controls Tux ( or one of three other characters ) as he slides down a course of snow and ice collecting herring . Sliding on ice makes Tux go faster , while sliding on snow allows for more maneuverability and sliding on rocky patches will slow Tux down . There are also trees to block Tux 's path and flags for sake of marking out the course . The left\/right steering controls are typical of a racing simulation game , except that the up arrow key causes Tux to â paddleâ with his flippers . Correct use of the paddle command is essential to getting good race times . Paddling slows Tux down when at a high speed but speeds him up at slow speeds . Paddling when in mid-air may also be used to increase the length of a jump . Jumps can be caused by the shape of the landscape or by holding down the `` energy '' key ( usually e ) and releasing it . Releasing the key when a jump is imminent will naturally make a larger jump . Versions with other controls instead of keyboard exist ; for example , wiimote and an arcade version with a steering wheel . Points are also scored by collecting herring that are scattered along the various courses . In order to progress to the next level of the game you have to both collect sufficient herring and reach the end of the course within a preset time limit . Like many open-source games , the replay value of Tux Racer is extended by easy modification of the game . New maps can be created by making three raster images to indicate height , surface , and object placement . Tux Racer was originally developed by Jasmin Patry , a student attending the University of Waterloo ( UW ) in Ontario , Canada , where he aimed to begin a career in the video game industry by pursuing a computer systems analyst ( CSA ) degree . Development of the game as a project began in August 1999 as a final computer graphics project in Computer Graphics Lab ( CGL ) . The game was completed and presented in three days ; a webpage for the game was then started , when one of Patry 's classmates , having enjoyed the presentation , suggested he released the software as open source . Patry felt releasing the game as open source `` made sense '' due to Tux being the mascot for Linux , an open source software , and continued to work on the game throughout the year , hoping fellow students would join in on developing the game . In December 1999 , Patry and his former classmates Patrick Gilhuly , Eric Hall , Rick Knowles , Mark Riddell , and Rob Kroeger announced the foundation of the company Sunspire Studios to develop a video game project . Patry stated the game `` would feature a massively multiplayer , persistent universe with real-time strategy and first-person shooter components , '' '' ( ... ) something that would make the Quake 3 or Unreal engine look tame in comparison . '' Fine arts undergraduate classmate Roger Fernandez was chosen as the artist ; however , the project was eventually abandoned due to limitations in current graphical software . In August 2000 , Knowles suggested the company resume working on Tux Racer , which became their first official project . The game was released as free software under the GNU General Public License on October 2 , 2000 . In August 2000 , Patry and his two friends Rick Knowles and Mark Riddell announced the development of an enhanced version of Tux Racer under a closed source commercial license . In 2001 , a demo version of the software was included with a January 2001 issue of PC Gamer . In 2002 , the game was released for Linux , Mac OS X , and Microsoft Windows operating systems . Patry states that had the game sold better , ports for the Nintendo GameCube and Xbox would be `` fairly logical '' choices . In 2003 , Sunspire Studios ceased business . Their Internet domains are now commercially cybersquatted . According to archive.org , there had been no significant changes to their site since September 22 , 2002 , when the Tux Racer 1.1.1 Linux Patch was released . It appears that the site continued to exist almost unchanged until 2004 . Their demo of version 1.1 can still be downloaded . Despite the game ceasing production , certain forks of Tux Racer exist , including Open Racer , an open source fork of the original Tux Racer created by Nathan Matias for SourceForge in 2001 ; this version was eventually abandoned . A fork entitled PlanetPenguin Racer , an enhanced version of the GPL-licensed version of Tux Racer , was created ; however , it was discontinued in 2006 , with the latest release being in 2005 . A new project based on PlanetPenguin Racer entitled Extreme Tux Racer was developed on March 2007 , and is currently in development . An arcade redemption game entitled Tux Racer Arcade has been released by Roxor Games ; a sequel entitled Tux 2 Arcade has also been released , featuring four courses and four characters from the commercial version , namely Tux , his friend Trixi , a female penguin , Boris , a bear , and Samuel , a seal .

`` You Do n't Love Me Anymore '' is an original song and single by `` Weird Al '' Yankovic . The promo CD single only contains `` You Do n't Love Me Anymore '' . The song is written as a soft acoustic ballad . However , the lyrics are of a destructiveâ '' literallyâ '' relationship between Yankovic and an unnamed girl . Although they were formerly in love , the `` flames died down '' and they are no longer passionate - in fact the girl hates Yankovic to such an extent that she repeatedly attempts to kill him . Much of the humor of the song is derived from the stark contrast between Yankovic 's delivery and the nature of the lyrics . As the relationship deteriorates , the woman 's actions progress from insults ( calling him ugly , cheap , and the Antichrist ) , to adultery ( sleeping `` with the whole hockey team '' ) , to bodily harm and pranks ( shaving his eyebrows while he slept , pulling out his chest hair with rusty pliers , shoving his head into a lit barbecue grill , drilling a hole in his skull ) , to arson , to attempted homicide ( putting poison in his coffee , cutting the brake lines on his car , pushing him down an elevator shaft , leaving a cobra in his dresser and piranhas in his bath , leaving him for dead in a ditch ) . Rather than alarm the protagonist over his personal safety , these actions merely cause him confusion about the status of the relationship , forcing him to admit , naÃ vely , that he `` get ( s ) to thinking you do n't love me anymore '' . On Off the Deep End , after the four minute song , there are ten minutes of silence , before six seconds of backwards drumming , guitar feedback , and Al screaming at the top of his lungs . According to Al , this `` most annoying six seconds of audio ever recorded '' was meant to scare the listener if he or she forgets to turn off the CD player . The six second snippet is called `` Bite Me '' . Also featured on The Weird Al Show though was three seconds long as used in the Ear Booker Productions logo . In 1992 `` You Do n't Love Me '' was remixed into a disco-styled song . The song , complete with loops and samples , was remixed by Mobile Disco Records . Yankovic 's official site states that , `` This is the only authorized extended mix of an Al song that was n't issued by his label . It 's an odd choice for a dance mix since it 's a ballad , but with loops and samples , it 's even more twisted than Al 's original version ! '' Although the music is original , the music video is a parody of `` More Than Words '' by Extreme , and continues where the `` Smells Like Nirvana '' video ends .

The up quark or u quark ( from its symbol , u ) is the lightest of all quarks , a type of elementary particle , and a major constituent of matter . It , along with the down quark , forms the neutrons ( one up quark , two down quarks ) and protons ( two up quarks , one down quark ) of atomic nuclei . It is part of the first generation of matter , has an electric charge of + e and a bare mass of 1.5 â `` . Like all quarks , the up quark is an elementary fermion with spin - ( ( spin-1 \/ 2 ) ) , and experiences all four fundamental interactions : gravitation , electromagnetism , weak interactions , and strong interactions . The antiparticle of the up quark is the up antiquark ( sometimes called antiup quark or simply antiup ) , which differs from it only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign . Its existence ( and that of the down and strange quarks ) was postulated in 1964 by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig to explain the Eightfold Way classification scheme of hadrons . The up quark was first observed by experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in 1968 . In the beginnings of particle physics ( first half of the 20th century ) , hadron such as protons , neutron and pions were thought to be elementary particles . However , as new hadrons were discovered , the ` particle zoo ' grew from a few particles in the early 1930s and 1940s to several dozens of them in the 1950s . The relationships between each of them was unclear until 1961 , when Murray Gell-Mann and Yuval Ne 'em an ( independently of each other ) proposed a hadron classification scheme called the Eightfold Way , or in more technical terms , SU ( 3 ) flavor symmetry . This classification scheme organized the hadrons into isospin multiplets , but the physical basis behind it was still unclear . In 1964 , Gell-Mann and George Zweig ( independently of each other ) proposed the quark model , then consisting only of up , down , and strange quarks . However , while the quark model explained the Eightfold Way , no direct evidence of the existence of quarks was found until 1968 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center . Deep inelastic scattering experiments indicated that protons had substructure , and that protons made of three more-fundamental particles explained the data ( thus confirming the quark model ) . At first people were reluctant to identify the three-bodies as quarks , instead preferring Richard Feynman 's parton description , but over time the quark theory became accepted ( see November Revolution ) . Despite being extremely common , the bare mass of the up quark is not well determined , but probably lies between 1.7 and . When found in mesons ( particles made of one quark and one antiquark ) or baryons ( particles made of three quarks ) , the ` effective mass ' ( or ` dressed ' mass ) of quarks become greater because of the binding energy caused by the gluon field between each quarks ( see massâ `` energy equivalence ) . For example , the effective mass of up quarks in a proton is around . Because the bare mass of up quarks is so light , it can not be straightforwardly calculated because relativistic effects have to be taken into account .

Pi Day is a holiday commemorating the mathematical constant Ï ( pi ) . Pi Day is celebrated on March 14 ( or 3\/14 in month\/day date format ) , since 3 , 1 and 4 are the three most significant digits of Ï in the decimal form . In 2009 , the United States House of Representatives supported the designation of Pi Day . Pi Approximation Day is held on July 22 ( or 22\/7 in day\/month date format ) , since the fraction 22 â 7 is a common approximation of Ï . Larry Shaw created Pi Day in 1988 . The holiday was celebrated at the San Francisco Exploratorium , where Shaw worked as a physicist , with staff and public marching around one of its circular spaces , then consuming fruit pies . The Exploratorium continues to hold Pi Day celebrations . On Pi Day 2004 , Daniel Tammet recited 22,514 decimal digits of Ï . On March 12 , 2009 , the U.S. House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution ( HRES 224 ) , recognizing March 14 , 2009 , as National Pi Day . For Pi Day 2010 , Google presented a Google Doodle celebrating the holiday , with the word Google laid over images of circles and pi symbols . Pi Day is observed on March 14 because of the date 's representation as 3\/14 in month\/day date format . This representation adheres to the commonly used approximation of 3.14 for Ï . The fractional approximation of Ï ,22 â 7 , resembles the date July 22 in the day\/month format , where it is written 22\/7 . Pi Approximation Day is therefore celebrated on July 22 . In 2015 , Pi Day will reflect five digits of Ï ( 3.1415 ) as 3/14/15 in month\/day\/year date format . There are many ways of celebrating Pi Day . Some of them include eating pie ( pi and pie being homophones ) and discussing the relevance of Ï . The Massachusetts Institute of Technology often mails its application decision letters to prospective students for delivery on Pi Day .
Stratford is a place name found in many English-speaking countries . It derives from the Old English words strÃ t ( a street , more specifically a Roman road ) and ford ( a river-crossing ) . A variant of the name is `` Stretford '' .
Fort Gibson is a town in Cherokee and Muskogee counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma . The population was 4,054 at the 2000 census . It is the location of Fort Gibson National Cemetery and is located near at the end of the Cherokees ' Trail of Tears at Tahlequah , Oklahoma . Colonel Matthew Arbuckle of United States Army established Fort Gibson in 1824 . The Army abandoned the fort in 1890 . Some of the original fort still stands at the historic site . Fort Gibson is located at ( 35.794861 , -95.253090 ) . According to the United States Census Bureau , the town has a total area of 36.3 kmÂ ( 14.0 miÂ ) . 34.8 kmÂ ( 13.4 miÂ ) of it is land and 1.5 kmÂ ( 0.6 miÂ ) of it ( 4.14 % ) is water . After the founding of Fort Gibson , military families , Indians desiring military protection , and free African-Americans settled near the fort , forming a town . After the Army abandoned Fort Gibson in 1857 , the Cherokee Nation took over the military stockade and renamed the town Keetoowah . The Army reoccupied Fort Gibson during the American Civil War , and the town again prospered as refugees from fighting elsewhere fled to the relative safety of the fort . On May 20 , 1898 , the Articles of Incorporation for the town of Fort Gibson , Oklahoma were established under the Arkansas Statutes , placing all of the densely settled areas under one jurisdiction . Fires , mosquitoes , and other afflictions beset the poorly located town of Fort Gibson , and the town moved to higher ground around 1900 . The first buildings , including `` Black Town '' ( an African American section ) , faced west toward the Missouri Pacific Railroad tracks . In 1904 the town of Fort Gibson , Indian Territory , was surveyed and platted . In 1904 the town was turned around and situated one block east when J. C. Pierce built the first brick building . In 1906 John C. Berd constructed a brick-and-stone building for his drugstore , and the commercial district grew around these two permanent features . Its 1907 population comprised 1,063 residents . One of the oldest non-Indian settlements in Oklahoma , Fort Gibson had other firsts , such as the first telephone , first drama theater , first steamboat landing , first school for the blind , first highway to Fort Smith , the first interurban , which connected Fort Gibson to Muskogee , and one of the first post offices . In 1896 J. S. Holden began publishing a weekly newspaper , the Post . At least six other newspapers followed in the early 20th century ; the Fort Gibson Times carried this tradition into the 21st century . In 1940 , 1,233 people populated the town , and by 1970 there were 1,418 citizens . Home to twenty-six churches and fourteen civic clubs and organizations at the beginning of the 21st century , the town boasted a strong civic spirit . The town has a board of trustees type of government . The manufacturing industry supports the majority of laborers , with the health care sector a close second . The 2000 census listed 4,054 residents , and the school system housed nineteen hundred students at a teacher-student ratio of one to fifteen .

In 1958 Brush Traction Ltd and Beyer Peacock co-operated to produce five prototype diesel-electric shunting locomotives of 0-4-0 wheel arrangement . They were intended to demonstrate a new generation of diesel shunters for industrial and mainline use . Two were loaned to British Railways for trials , and one was subsequently purchased by BR . However no large scale orders resulted from these demonstrators . Similar locomotives were built for industrial use , notably for steelworks in South Wales and Yorkshire . These were built by Brush Traction working with Bagnall . An example is preserved on the Middleton Railway . D2999 was loaned to BR from 1960 and subsequently purchased by them for further use , being withdrawn in October 1967 . It was fitted with a National M4AAV6 engine of 200 h , had a maximum speed of 18 m and weighed 30 tons . D9998 was on loan to BR for approximately a year from mid-1961 . It was fitted with a Petter-McLaren engine of 200 h , had a maximum speed of 18 m and weighed 30 tons .
William `` Billy '' McNeill MBE DUniv ( born 2 March 1940 ) is a former Scottish footballer and manager . He is best known for captaining Celtic to the European Cup triumph in 1967 and he later went on to manage the club . He is now the official Club Ambassador at Celtic . McNeill , nicknamed Cesar , was voted the greatest ever captain of Celtic by the club 's fans in 2002 . He was signed by Celtic from nearby junior team , Blantyre Victoria , in 1957 as a defender . As captain he won nine Scottish League Championships , seven Scottish Cups , and six Scottish League Cups . He also led the team to victory in the European Cup in 1967 , as part of the `` Lisbon Lions '' , and was the first British footballer to hold aloft the European Cup . He retired as a player in 1975 after 790 appearances for Celtic , in which he played every minute , never having been substituted . He won 29 caps for Scotland . He began his management career at Clyde in April 1977 before moving to Aberdeen in June . However , in 1978 he returned to manage Celtic . His five years in charge saw Celtic win three League Championships , one Scottish Cup and one League cup . On 30 June 1983 he moved to England to manage Manchester City . He secured promotion for City after two seasons in charge , and oversaw survival in their first season back . In 1986 -- 87 , he became one of the few managers to manage two relegated teams in the same season . He started the season as manager of Manchester City but quit in September 1986 to take charge of fellow strugglers Aston Villa . When Villa were relegated after finishing bottom of the First Division in May 1987 , he stood down to make way for Graham Taylor and returned to Celtic . In his first season Celtic won the double of the League Championship and Scottish Cup in the clubs ' centenary year . 1987 -- 88 , was renowned for late goals for Celtic and in both the semi final and final , Celtic scored late goals to emerge victorious 2 -- 1 in both games . He won the Scottish Cup the following season , but quit in 1991 after four years as manager . McNeill 's second spell as manager was blighted by the reluctance of the Board to spend money in the transfer market . McNeill had a brief spell as director of football at Hibs in 1998 , where he unsuccessfully attempted to arrest a decline in fortunes at the club . He briefly took caretaker charge of the team after Jim Duffy was sacked , even though McNeill had been out of football since leaving Celtic in 1991 and was recovering from heart surgery . He left Hibs at the end of the 1997 -- 98 season . McNeill unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for the Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party in the 2003 Scottish Parliament election . In 2008 , he was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Glasgow in recognition of his outstanding achievement in football and for his distinguished role as an ambassador for the national sport . Celtic 's Chief Executive Peter Lawwell said : `` Billy McNeill has served Celtic Football Club and Scottish football in general with distinction over many years . He is a man of immense stature and someone who , as a player and manager was the complete professional . Billy was a born leader on and off the field . To captain Celtic and become the first British Club to win the European Cup , the biggest prize in Club football , is a massive achievement and Billy and the other Lisbon Lions will forever be among the most important figures in Celtic 's illustrious history . Billy is fully deserving of the tremendous honor which has been bestowed on him . Everyone at the Club congratulates him on receiving the Honorary Degree from the University of Glasgow . ''
Sprimont is a municipality of Belgium . It lies in the country 's Walloon Region and Province of Liege . On January 1 , 2006 Sprimont had a total population of 12,782 . The total area is 74.28 km which gives a population density of 172 inhabitants per kmÂ . Sprimont is an ancient name , whose earliest written records are 855 and 856 AD . These are located in the Abbey de Stavlot . The etymology of Sprimont is debatable . A priori it seems to the name of a place ; however some historians propose it is possible it derives from an actual person ( BULLETIN ET ANNALES DE L'ACADEMIE D'ARCHEOLOGIE DE BELGIQUE TOME XXXVII , BULLETIN DE LA INSTITUTE ARCHEOLOGIQUE LIEGEOIS TOME VII ) . Spellings ( of Sprimont ) may be different depending on ( 1 ) the written language , and ( 2 ) the time period ( i.e. century ) . Since Sprimont is more than 1,100 years old , one is likely to see various spellings . However , since about 1000 AD , ` Sprimont ' seems to be exclusively used . For example , Ernst cites SPIRISMONTE in 888 AD , and Martine & Duraud cites SPRISMONT in 1049 . In BULLETIN DE LA INSTITUTE ARCHEOLOGIQUE LIEGEOIS TOME VII , further references to Teutonic ( SPIR-BOUM , SPEREBOUM , SPER-BOUN ) and Frisia are made ( SPIRI , SPERE , SPER ) , as well as Latin ( sorbus ) . These can translate into more modern words as ` speer , ' ` hasta , ' and ` lance . ' The consensus is the roots are of Latin origin . The suffix ` mont , ' likely is from mons . This could mean either a hill , or mount , but some historians point out that many geographic names with the suffix are not on a hill , but some are even in a valley . This brings into question if ` mount ' does indeed mean ` hill . ' Another source indicates ` mount ' was used in Roman times to indicate a ` way-station ' for travelers . This makes sense , but researching ancient roads , then analyzing all geographic places on these roads to cross reference ` mont ' would be needed . As for the prefix of Sprimont , ` spri , ' more debate is required , as its origin seems to be lost to antiquity . Ancient written documents ( insert reference ) indicate several Latin origins ; spiris , spers , ... Regardless of the meaning of the root word , one must also consider the usage in the context of the name itself . For example , if it does indeed refer to the species of wood , in those ancient times , what was the connotation ? ( reference ) argues in persuasive ways , that ` spri ' means ` lance . ' Concluding the etymology of Sprimont , the active might mean ` Mounted Warrior , ' whereas the passive might mean ` Lance of Defense . ' This is from mont de SPIRIS .

A still is a permanent apparatus used to distill miscible or immiscible ( eg . steam distillation ) liquid mixtures by heating to selectively boil and then cooling to condense the vapor . Stills have been used to produce perfume and medicine , Water for Injection ( WFI ) for pharmaceutical use , generally to separate and purify different chemicals , and most famously , to produce distilled beverages containing ethyl alcohol . Since ethyl alcohol boils at a lower temperature than water , a common application of the process of distillation is to produce strong alcoholic drinks . Usually a still used for this purpose is made of copper , since it removes sulfur-based compounds from the alcohol that would make it unpleasant to drink . Modern stills are made of stainless steel with copper innards ( piping , for example , will be lined with copper along with copper plate inlays along still walls ) . Using this combination of metals is much cheaper as it prevents erosion of the entire vessel and lowers copper levels in the waste product ( which in large distilleries is processed to become animal feed ) . All copper stills will require repairs about every 8 years because of copper erosion from the compounds it is designed to remove ; this erosion is therefore unavoidable . The alcohol industry was the first to use anything close to a modern distillation apparatus and led the way in developing what is now a large part of the chemical industry . There is also an increasing usage of distillation of gin under glass and PTFE , and even at reduced pressures , to facilitate a fresher product . This is irrelevant to alcohol quality , because the process starts with triple distilled grain alcohol , and the distillation is used solely to harvest botanical flavors such as limonene and other terpene like compounds . The ethyl alcohol is relatively unchanged . The simplest standard distillation apparatus is commonly known as a pot still , consisting of a single heated chamber and a vessel to collect purified alcohol . A pot still incorporates only one condensation , whereas other types of distillation equipment have multiple stages which result in higher purification of the more volatile component ( alcohol ) . Pot still distillation gives an incomplete separation , but this can be desirable for the flavor of some distilled beverages . If a purer distillate is desired , a reflux still is the most common solution . Reflux stills incorporate a fractionating column , commonly created by filling copper vessels with glass beads to maximize available surface area . As alcohol boils , condenses , and reboils through the column , the effective number of distillations greatly increases . Vodka and Gin and other neutral grain spirits are distilled by this method , then diluted to concentrations appropriate for human consumption . Alcoholic products from home distilleries are common throughout the world , but are sometimes in violation of local statutes . The product of illegal stills in the United States is commonly referred to as moonshine and in Ireland Poteen .
However , it was when naturism arrived in the more sexually conservative cultures of the UK and the United States that the expression and discussion of eroticism within naturism became frowned upon . The Turkic languages constitute a language family of at least thirty five languages , spoken by Turkic peoples across a vast area from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean to Siberia and Western China , and are considered to be part of the proposed Altaic language family . Turkic languages are spoken as a native language by some 165 to 180 million people ; and the total number of Turkic speakers is over 250 million , including speakers of a second language . The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is Turkish proper , or Anatolian ( and Balkan ) Turkish , the speakers of which account for about 40 % of all Turkic speakers . Characteristic features of Turkish , such as vowel harmony , agglutination , and lack of grammatical gender , are universal within the Turkic family . There is also a high degree of mutual intelligibility between the various Oghuz languages , which include Turkish , Azerbaijani , Turkmen , Qashqai , Gagauz , and Balkan Gagauz Turkish . The characteristic features of the Turkic languages are vowel harmony , extensive agglutination by means of suffixes and other affixes , and lack of noun classes or grammatical gender . Subject Object Verb word order is universal within the family . All of these distinguishing characteristics are shared with the Mongolic and Tungusic language families , as well as with the Korean language and even Japanese , purportedly ( with the exception of vowel harmony ) , which are by some linguists considered to be genetically linked with the Turkic languages in the proposed Altaic language family , a language family rejected by most linguists though accepted in the Voegelin & Voegelin classification ( 1977:18 -19 ) . The geographical distribution of Turkic-speaking peoples across Eurasia ranges from the North-East of Siberia to Turkey in the West ( see picture in the box on the right above ) . The first established records of the Turkic languages are the 8th century Orkhon inscriptions by the GÃ ktÃ 1\/4 rks , recording the Old Turkic language , which were discovered in 1889 in the Orkhon Valley in Mongolia . The Compendium of the Turkic Dialects ( DivÃ cents nÃ 1\/4 LÃ 1\/4 gati ` t-T Ã 1\/4 rk ) , written during the 11th century by KaÅ garlÄ Mahmud of the Kara-Khanid Khanate , constitutes an early linguistic treatment of the family . The Compendium is the first comprehensive dictionary of the Turkic languages and also includes the first known map of the Turkic speakers ' geographical distribution . It mainly pertains to the Southwestern branch of the family . The Codex Cumanicus ( 12th - 13th centuries ) concerning the Northwestern branch is another early linguistic manual , between the Kipchak language and Latin , used by the Catholic missionaries sent to the Western Cumans inhabiting a region corresponding to present-day Hungary and Romania . The earliest records of the language spoken by Volga Bulgars , the parent to today 's Chuvash language , are dated to the 13th - 14th centuries . With the Turkic expansion during Early Middle Ages ( c. 6th - 11th centuries ) , Turkic languages , in the course of just a few centuries , spread across Central Asia , stretching from Siberia ( the Sakha Republic ) to the Mediterranean ( Seljuk Turks ) . Various elements from the Turkic languages have passed into Hungarian , Persian , Hindustani , Russian , Chinese and to a lesser extent , Arabic . For centuries , the Turkic speaking peoples have migrated extensively and intermingled continuously , and their languages have been influenced mutually and through contact with the surrounding languages , especially the Iranian , Slavic , and Mongolic languages . This has obscured the historical developments within each language and\/or language group , and as a result , there exist several systems to classify the Turkic languages . The modern genetic classification schemes for Turkic are still largely indebted to Samoilovich ( 1922 ) and are mainly based on the development of \* d. However , there are still many questions for which ongoing research has not yet found an adequate solution . In this classification , Oghur Turkic is also referred to as Lir-Turkic and the other branches are subsumed under the title of Shaz-Turkic or Common Turkic . It is not clear when these two major types of Turkic can be assumed to have actually diverged . With less certainty , the Southwestern , Northwestern , Southeastern and Oghur groups may further be summarized as West Turkic , the Northeastern , Kyrgyz-Kipchak and Arghu ( Khalaj ) groups as East Turkic . Geographically and linguistically , the languages of the Northwestern and Southeastern subgroups belong to the central Turkic languages , while the Northeastern and Khalaj languages are the so-called peripheral languages . The following is a brief comparison of cognates among the basic vocabulary across the Turkic language family ( about 60 words ) . Note that empty cells do not necessarily imply that a particular language is lacking a word to describe the concept , but rather that the word for the concept in that language may be formed from another stem and is not a cognate with the other words in the row or that the equivalent was unknown to contributors to this article . Also , there may be shifts in the meaning from one language to another , and so the `` common meaning '' given is only approximate . In some cases the form given is found only in some dialects of the language .

Shadwell DLR station on the Docklands Light Railway is between the terminals of Bank and Tower Gateway to the west and Limehouse to the east . The 1991 Bank extension joins the main DLR line just to the west of Shadwell . It opened on 31 August 1987 as part of the first tranche of DLR stations . Initially designed for one-car DLR trains , Shadwell 's platform underwent extension to two-car operation in 1991 . The station underwent further refurbishment in 2009 , which extended the platforms to accommodate three-car trains , revamped the station entrance at ground level , and added an emergency exit at the east end of the platforms . The station stands on a viaduct and consists of a single island platform serving trains in both directions . The ticket machines and entrance are located at ground level to the west of the island platforms , facing onto Watney Street . The station is usually unstaffed like most other stations on the DLR . There is a crossover west of the station which allows trains from Westferry , Bank or Tower Gateway to reverse here . London Bus route 339 stops near the station . Nearby is station on the London Overground ( formerly the London Underground East London Line ) , a very short walk away , on the other side of Watney Street from the DLR station , with entrances on Cornwall Street and Cable Street . The interchange between the two is denoted as an official interchange on the London Underground map .
The Wedge-tailed Shearwater , Puffinus pacificus is a medium-large shearwater in the seabird family Procellariidae . It is one of the shearwater species that is sometimes referred to as a Muttonbird , like the Sooty Shearwater of New Zealand and the Short-tailed Shearwater of Australia . It ranges across from throughout the tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean roughly between latitudes 35 Â N and 35 Â S. It breeds in islands such as off Japan , the Islas Revillagigedo , the Hawaiian Islands , the Seychelles and off Western Australia . The Wedge-tailed Shearwater is the largest of the tropical shearwaters . There are two color morphs of the species , dark and pale ; the pale morphs predominate in the North Pacific , the dark morph elsewhere . However , both morphs exist in all populations , and bear no relation to sex or breeding condition . The pale morph has grey-brown plumage on the back , head and upperwing , and whiter plumage below . The darker morph has the same dark grey-brown plumage over the whole body . The speciesâ common name is derived from the large wedge-shaped tail , which may help the species glide . The bill is dark and legs are flesh colored , with the legs set far back on the body ( in common with the other shearwaters ) as an adaptation for swimming . This species is related to the pan-Pacific Buller 's Shearwater , which differs much in color pattern , but also has a wedgetail and a thin black bill ( Austin , 1996 ; Austin et al . , 2004 ) . They make up the Thyellodroma group , a superspecies in the large shearwaters of the proposed genus Ardenna ( Penhallurick & Wink , 2004 ) . Wedge-tailed Shearwaters feed pelagically on fish , squid and crustaceans . 66 % of their diet is fish , of which the most commonly taken is goatfish . It was thought that the species mostly took food from surface feeding , observations of feeding Wedge-tails suggested that contact-dipping , where birds flying close to the surface snatch prey from the water was the most commonly used hunting technique . However , a 2001 study which deployed maximum depth recorders found that 83 % of Wedge-tails dived during foraging trips with a mean maximum depth of 14 m and that they could achieve a depth of 66 m ( Burger , 2001 ) . The Wedge-tailed Shearwater breeds in colonies on small tropical islands . Breeding seasons vary depending on location , with synchronised breeding seasons more common at higher latitudes . Northern hemisphere birds begin breeding around February , southern hemisphere birds begin around September . Wedge-tailed Shearwaters display natal philopatry , returning to their natal colony to begin breeding at the age of four . Wedge-tailed Shearwaters are monogamous , forming a long term pair bond that lasts for several years . Divorce between pairs occurs after breeding seasons that end in failure . Nesting either in burrows or sometimes on the surface under cover . Pairs call frequently as a pair , both to reinforce the pair bond and warn intruders away from their territory . Parents also call to their chicks . The call is long , with an inhaling component ( OOO ) and exhaling component ( err ) ; their Hawaiian name uaâ u kani means moaning petrel . Both sexes participate in digging a burrow , or repairing the burrow from last year . Nesting burrows of other species are also used . The breeding season of the Bonin Petrel in Hawaii is timed to avoid that of the Wedge-tail ; in years where Bonin Petrel chicks are still in burrows when Wedge-tails return to begin breeding these chicks are killed or evicted . It attends these colonies nocturnally , although non-breeding Wedge-tails are often seen at the surface throughout the day and breeding birds will rest outside their burrows before laying . Both sexes undertake a prelaying exodus in order to build up energy reserves , this usually lasts around 28 days . A single egg is laid , if that egg is lost then the pair will not attempt another that season . After laying the male usually undertakes the first incubation stint . Both sexes incubate the egg , in stints that can last up to 13 days . Incubation takes around 50 days . After hatching the chick is brooded for up to six days , until it is able to thermoregulate , after which it is left alone in the nest while both parents hunt for food . It is initially fed with stomach oil , an energy rich waxy oil of digested prey created in the parentâ s gut ; later it is fed both solids and stomach oil . Unlike many procellariids Wedge-tailed Shearwater parents to not alternate long and short trips to provide food , but return regularly . Chicks increase in size to 560 g ( larger than the adults ) then drop to around 430 g before fledging . Fledging occurs after 103-115 days , after which the chick is independent of the adult .
In his 1909 paper , he established variegated leaf color as the first conclusive example of cytoplasmic inheritance . Woodward 's Wallaroo ( Macropus bernardus ) , also known as the Black Wallaroo and Bernard 's Wallaroo , is a species of macropod restricted to a small , mountainous area in Arnhem Land , Northern Territory , between South Alligator River and Nabarlek . It classified as near threatened , mostly due to its limited distribution . Woodward 's Wallaroo is by far the smallest of the wallaroos as well as the most distinctive . It is sexually dimorphic , with the male being completely black or dark brown and the female a mid-grey color . It is little known but is known to be a shy nocturnal grazer which does not gather in groups .
Purple Mountain Observatory , also known as Zijinshan Astronomical Observatory , is an astronomical observatory located on the Purple Mountain in Nanjing , China . The long time director of the observatory ( from 1950 to 1984 ) was Zhang Yuzhe ( å 1\/4 é ' å `` ) ( Y. C. Chang ) . The observatory discovered the periodic comets 60P\/Tsuchinshan and 62P\/Tsuchinshan , and also the non-periodic C\/1977 V1 ( Tsuchinshan ) , also known as Comet 1977 X. Many asteroids were also discovered at the observatory , including the Trojan asteroids 2223 Sarpedon , 2260 Neoptolemus , 2363 Cebriones , 2456 Palamedes , as well as the eponymous 3494 Purple Mountain .

Le Rouret is an example of a typical ProvenÃ al village undergoing modern development : evidence of its agricultural present and past remains clear despite increased tourism , cultural activities and housing developments . Two sites in Le Rouret show signs of ancient occupation : Le camp du bois du Rouret and Le Castellaras . Le camp du bois is situated on a hilltop . Digs carried out by Paul Goby at the end of the 19th century showed signs of habitations from around 400BC , with the most dense period of occupation being around 100BC . Le Castellaras is very similar but additionally sports a fallen monolith , thought to date from the Neolithic era or bronze age .

It was inaugurated in 1778 . Plaza is a Spanish word related to `` field '' which describes an open urban public space , such as a city square . All through Spanish America , the plaza mayor of each center of administration held three closely related institutions : the cathedral , the cabildo or administrative center , which might be incorporated in a wing of a governor 's palace , and the audiencia or law court . The plaza might be large enough to serve as a military parade ground . At times of crisis or fiesta , it was the space where a large crowd might gather . Like the Italian piazza , the plaza remains a center of community life that is only equaled by the market-place . Most colonial cities in Spanish America and the Philippines were planned around a square plaza de armas , where troops could be mustered , as the name implies , surrounded by the governor 's palace and the main church . A plaza de toros is a bullring . In modern usage , a plaza can be any gathering place on a street or between buildings , a street intersection with a statue , etc. . Thus contemporary metropolitan landscapes often incorporate the `` plaza '' as a design element , or as an outcome of zoning regulations , building budgetary constraints , and the like . Sociologist William H. Whyte conducted an extensive study of plazas in New York City : his study humanized the way modern urban plazas are conceptualized , and helped usher in significant design changes in the making of plazas . The Italian cognate is Piazza , the Portuguese PraÃ a , the French Place , the Romanian PiaÈ a and the German Platz . The first purpose-built shopping center in the United States , opened in Kansas City , Missouri in 1922 , knowingly took the name of `` Country Club Plaza '' and adopted Spanish architectural details . More recently plaza has been used to describe a shopping complex , similar to a shopping mall , borrowing its connotations of a center of cultural life . The name is currently even applied to a single building with some semi-public street-level areas , often with a hotel or office tower above , while mall more often refers to multiple buildings or a street . Examples : Pantip Plaza , Clinton Plaza , Plaza Las AmÃ ricas , Central Plaza , Hong Kong , Schiphol Plaza , The Plaza .

A luthier is someone who makes or repairs stringed instruments . In the United States , the term is used interchangeably with a term for the specialty of each maker , such as violinmaker , guitar maker , lute maker , etc. . The word luthier comes from the French word luth , which means `` lute '' . The craft of making string instruments , or lutherie , is commonly divided into two main categories : makers of stringed instruments that are plucked or strummed and makers of stringed instruments that are bowed . Since bowed instruments require a bow , the second category includes a subtype known as a bow maker or archetier . Important luthiers who specialized in the instruments of the lute family ( lutes , archlutes , theorbos , vihuelas etc. ) : Two important early luthiers in the guitar category were Panormo and Stauffer families . Antonio Torres Jurado is credited with developing the form of classical guitar that is still in use today , and Christian Frederick Martin of Germany who developed a form that evolved into the modern steel-string acoustic guitar . The American luthier Orville Gibson specialized in mandolins , and is credited with creating the archtop guitar . The important 20th Century American luthiers John D'Angelico and Jimmy D'Aquisto made archtop guitars . Lloyd Loar worked briefly for the Gibson Guitar Corporation making mandolins and guitars . His designs for a family of archtop instruments ( mandolin , mandola , guitar , et cetera ) are held in high esteem by today 's luthiers , who seek to reproduce their sound . Paul Bigsby 's innovation of the tremolo arm for archtop and electric guitars is still in use today and may have influenced Leo Fender 's design for the Stratocaster solid body electric guitar , as well as the Jaguar and Jazzmaster . Concurrent with Fender 's work , guitarist Les Paul independently developed a solid body electric guitar . These were the first fretted solid body electric guitars -- though they were preceded by the cast aluminum `` frying pan , '' a solid body electric lap steel guitar developed and eventually patented by George Beauchamp , and built by Adolph Rickenbacher . A company founded by luthier Friedrich Gretsch and continued by his son and grandson , Fred and Fred Jr. , originally made banjos , but is more famous today for its electric guitars . Vintage guitars are often sought by collectors . Bowed instruments include : cello , crwth , double bass , erhu , fiddle , hudok , mouthbow , nyckelharpa , hurdy gurdy , rabab , rebec , sarangi , viol , viola , viola da braccio , viola d'amore , viola da gamba and violin . The purported `` inventor '' of the violin is Andrea Amati . Amati was originally a lute maker but turned to the new instrument form of violin in the mid 16th century . He was the progenitor of the famous Amati family of luthiers active in Cremona , Italy until the 18th century . Andrea Amati 's son , NicolÃ , was himself an important master luthier who had several apprentices of note including Andrea Guarneri , Francesco Ruggieri , Antonio Stradivari , Giovanni Battista Rogeri , Matthias Klotz and possibly Jacob Stainer . Two other important early luthiers of the violin family were the double bass player , son and nephew of the two violin players Gasparo da SalÃ of Brescia , Italy and Gasparo Duiffopruggar of Austria who were each originally credited with invention of the first violin . However , this attribute has since been removed but is still often incorrectly cited . Da SalÃ had at least five apprentices : his son Francesco , and helper named Battista , the French Alexander of Marsiglia , Giacomo Lafranchini and , last , the most important is -- Giovanni Paolo Maggini who inherited da SalÃ 's business in Brescia upon da SalÃ 's death . Valentino Siani worked with Giovanni Paolo Maggini . In 1620 he moved to Florence . Of those luthiers born in the mid 17th century , there are Giovanni Grancino , Carlo Giuseppe Testore and son Carlo Antonio Testore , all from Milan . From Venice the luthiers Matteo Goffriller , Domenico Montagnana , Sanctus Seraphin and Carlo Annibale Tononi were principals in the Venetian school of violin making ( although the latter began his career in Bologna ) . The Bergonzi family of luthiers were the successors to the Amati family in Cremona . David Tecchler who was born in Austria later worked in both Venice and Rome . Important luthiers from the early 18th century include NicolÃ Gagliano of Naples , Italy , Carlo Ferdinando Landolfi of Milan and Giovanni Battista Guadagnini who roamed throughout Italy during his lifetime . From Austria originally , Leopold Widhalm later established himself in NÃ 1\/4 rnberg , Germany . The early 19th century luthiers of the Mirecourt school of violin making in France were the Vuillaume family , Charles Jean Baptiste Collin-Mezin , and Collin-Mezin 's son , Charles Collin-Mezin , Jr. . The JÃ rÃ me-Thibouville-Lamy firm started making wind instruments around 1730 at La Couture-Boussey , then moved to Mirecourt around 1760 and started making violins , guitars , mandolins , and musical accessories .

For other uses , see Sha ( disambiguation ) . Sha ( Ð Ñ ; italics : Ð Ñ ) is a letter of the Cyrillic alphabet . It commonly represents the voiceless postalveolar fricative \/ Ê \/ , like the pronunciation of â shâ in `` sheep '' , or the somewhat similar voiceless retroflex fricative \/ Ê \/ . It is used in every variation of the Cyrillic alphabet , for Slavic and non-Slavic languages . In English , Sha is romanized as â shâ or as â Å â , the latter being the being the equivalent letter in the Latin alphabets of Czech , Slovak , Slovene , and Croatian . Sha has its earliest origins in Phoenician Shin and is linked closely to Shin 's Greek equivalent : Sigma ( Î # , Ï ) . ( Note the similar form of the modern Hebrew Shin ( ) , which also derives from the same Proto-Canaanite source ) . Sha already possessed its current form in Saints Cyril and Methodius 's Glagolitic alphabet . Most Cyrillic letter-forms were derived from the Greek , but as there was no Greek sign for the Sha sound ( modern Greek uses simply '' Ï '' to spell the sh-sound in foreign words and names ) , Glagolitic Sha was adopted unchanged . There is a possibility that Sha was taken from the Coptic alphabet , which was the same as the Greek alphabet but had a few letters added at the end , including one called `` shai '' which somewhat resembles both sha and shcha ( Ð , Ñ ) in appearance . In algebraic geometry , the Tate-Shafarevich group of an Abelian variety A over a field K is denoted Ð ( A\/K ) , a notation first suggested by J. W. S. Cassels . ( Previously it had been unimaginatively denoted TS . ) In a different mathematical context , some authors allude to the shape of the letter Sha when they use the term Shah function for what is otherwise called a Dirac comb .
The energy of surface electromagnetic waves can break the light barrier c. It is a good model helpful to extend special relativity and study the tachyon . Nausea ( Latin nausea , from Greek , nausiÄ `` , `` motion sickness '' , or `` wamble '' ) , is a sensation of unease and discomfort in the upper stomach with an involuntary urge to vomit . An attack of nausea is known as a qualm . The most common cause is motion sickness ( see definition , above ) , most often in automobiles , followed by gastroenteritis ( a stomach infection ) or food poisoning but nausea also frequently occurs as a medication side effect and in pregnancy . There are some medications , called antiemetics , that improve symptoms of nausea , including metoclopramide and ondansetron . The causes of nausea are many . One organization listed 700 in 2009 . Gastrointestinal infections ( 37 % ) and food poisoning are the two most common causes . While side effects from medications ( 3 % ) and pregnancy are also relatively frequent . In 10 % of people the cause remains unknown . Food poisoning usually causes an abrupt onset of nausea and vomiting one to six hours after ingestion of contaminated food and lasts for one to two days . It is due to toxins produced by bacteria in the food . Most medications can potentially cause nausea . Some of the most frequently associated include chemotherapy regimens and general anesthetic agents . Nausea or `` morning sickness '' is a common symptom of pregnancy . In the first trimester nearly 80 % of women have some degree of nausea . Pregnancy should therefore be considered as a possible cause of nausea in any women of child bearing age . While usually it is mild and self limiting severe cases known as hyperemesis gravidarum may require treatment . A number of conditions involving balance such as motion sickness and vertigo can lead to nausea and vomiting . While most causes of nausea are not serious some serious causes do occur . These include : diabetic ketoacidosis , surgical problems ( pancreatitis , small bowel obstruction , meningitis , appendicitis , cholecystitis ) , Addisonian crisis , Choledocholithiasis ( from gallstones ) and hepatitis , signs of carbon monoxide poison among others . Often no investigations are needed , however basic lab tests may be appropriate . If a bowel obstruction is considered , abdominal x-rays may be useful . If dehydration is present , rehydration with oral electrolyte solutions is preferred . If this is not effective , intravenous rehydration may be required . Dimenhydrinate ( Gravol ) is an inexpensive and effective medication for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting . Meclozine is another antihistamine antiemetic . In certain people , cannabinoids may be effective in reducing chemotherapy associated nausea and vomiting . Ondansetron ( Zofran ) is effective for nausea and vomiting but is expensive . Pyridoxine or metoclopramide are the first line treatments for pregnancy related nausea and vomiting . Medical marijuana may be prescribed where allowed for certain indication . While short-term nausea and vomiting are generally harmless , they may sometimes indicate a more serious condition . When associated with prolonged vomiting , it may lead to dehydration and\/or dangerous electrolyte imbalances . Nausea and or vomiting is the main complaint in 1.6 % of visits to family physicians in Australia . However only 25 % of people with nausea visit their family physician .

Ratingen is a town in the district of Mettmann , in North Rhine-Westphalia , Germany , in the northwestern part of Berg - about 12 km northeast of DÃ 1\/4 sseldorf . It is twinned with Cramlington , England , with Gagarin , Russia and Vermillion , South Dakota in the United States . With a communal reform of 1975 the independent municipalities of Breitscheid , Eggerscheidt , HÃ sel , Lintorf ( seat Angerland ) as well as the local part of Homberg and the municipality of Homberg-Meiersberg ( seat Hubbelrath ) were added into the city of Ratingen . Ratingen was settled before 849 . Since the Middle Ages , the Ratingen area belonged to the count and later dukes of Berg . On December 11 , 1276 the settlement received city rights . Ratingen was one of the four places of Berg which experienced an economic boom in the end of the Middle Ages , but slowed down during the Thirty Years ' War . At the beginning of the Industrial Age , the first manufacturing plants opened in 1783 . In Cromford the first mechanical spinnery of Europe opened , which grew into the Textilfabrik Cromford , now part of the Rheinisches Industriemuseum ( Rhine Industry Museum ) . In the Napoleonic times , it became part of the city of Berg and in 1815 , into the Kingdom of Prussia . In the communal re-organization of 1929 , Ratingen maintained its independence . After relatively small war damage , Ratingen in the 1960s and the 1970s experienced years the growth and development ( West Ratingen with 20,000 inhabitants , developed in the late 1960s-1980s ) . Several important international enterprises ( particularly from the IT industry ) as Vodafone , Sun Microsystems , Hewlett-Packard , SAP , CEMEX , Tiptel and Esprit maintain branches and\/or main centers in Ratingen . In 1970 , before further incorporations the number of inhabitants surpassed 50,000 .
The Mediterranean Ridge is a wide ridge in the bed of the Mediterranean Sea , running along a rough quarter circle from Calabria , south of Crete , to the southwest corner of Turkey , and from there eastwards south of Turkey , including Cyprus . According to tectonic theory , it is caused by the African Plate subducting under the Eurasian and Anatolian plates . As the African Plate moves slowly north-northeastward , it is plowing up the sediment layers of the Mediterranean , lifting them from the seabed , and in one area already above sea level , causing the island of Cyprus . In the far future it could grow into a long high mountain range if the continued northward movement of Africa obliterates the Mediterranean Sea . Along the ridge have been found five sink-holes full of anoxic brine where Messinian evaporite deposits caught up in this ongoing orogeny have dissolved .

Sierra Nevada is a Spanish phrase meaning `` snow-covered mountain range '' ( sierra is one of the Spanish words for `` mountain range '' ) .
The Triassicâ `` Jurassic extinction event marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods , , and is one of the major extinction events of the Phanerozoic eon , profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans . In the seas a whole class ( conodonts ) and twenty percent of all marine families disappeared . On land , all large crurotarsans ( non-dinosaurian archosaurs ) other than crocodilians , some remaining therapsids , and many of the large amphibians were wiped out . At least half of the species now known to have been living on Earth at that time went extinct . This event vacated terrestrial ecological niches , allowing the dinosaurs to assume the dominant roles in the Jurassic period . This event happened in less than 10,000 years and occurred just before Pangaea started to break apart . Statistical analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a decrease in speciation than by an increase in extinctions . The isotopic composition of fossil soils of end Triassic and Early Jurassic has been tied to a large negative carbon isotope excursion ( Whiteside et al . 2010 ) . Carbon isotopes of lipids ( n-alkanes ) derived from leaf wax and lignin , and total organic carbon from two sections of lake sediments interbedded with the CAMP in eastern North America have shown carbon isotope excursions similar to those found in the mostly marine St. Audrieâ s Bay section in England ; the correlation suggests that the end-Triassic extinction event began at the same time in marine and terrestrial environments , slightly before the oldest basalts in eastern North America but simultaneous with the eruption of the oldest flows in Morocco ( Also suggested by Deenen et al . , 2010 ) , with both a critical greenhouse and a marine biocalcification crisis . Contemporaneous CAMP eruptions , mass extinction , and the carbon isotopic excursions are shown in the same places , making the case for a volcanic cause of a mass extinction . The catastrophic dissociation of gas hydrates ( suggested as one possible cause of the largest mass extinction of all time , the so-called `` Great Dying '' at the end of the Permian Period ) may have exacerbated greenhouse conditions .

Sidney Rodrigue Noukpo Govou ( ; born 27 July 1979 ) is a French football player of Beninese descent who currently plays for Panathinaikos F.C. of Greece and French national team . Govou is a naturally attacking player but rarely plays as a striker , he is more commonly deployed as a winger . His main attribute is his pace . At the start of the 09\/10 season Govou was given the captain 's armband of Lyon after the departure of Juninho Pernambucano . Staying at school to complete his studies to a comparatively late age for a footballer , Govou was a late-comer to the sporting world , joining Lyon 's youth academy at the age of 17 in 1996 . Loyal to his first and only club Govou has , up until this point , played at the Stade Gerland for his entire professional career . Govou has often been criticised for his lack of composure in front of goal , especially in high-pressure situations , which partly explains why he now occupies a deeper role , often in wide positions , rather than playing as the focal point of the team 's attack . His offensive role , however , does not prevent him from often playing an important role in recovering possession for his team , due largely to his great athletic capabilities and high levels of fitness . He also has a good heading ability . During the 2004 â `` 05 season , Paul Le Guen handed Govou the captain 's armband during the long absence of club captain Claudio CaÃ apa due to injury . Le Guen 's decision was largely motivated by the loyalty displayed towards the club by Govou , in face of much speculation linking him with moves away from the club . Indeed , for the last three seasons Govou has been regularly linked to possible transfers away from Lyon , much helped by Govou 's admittance to finding the possibility of playing abroad an attractive one . On July 2 , 2010 , he signed a three-year contract with Panathinaikos . On September 14 , 2010 , Govou scored against Barcelona at the Nou Camp to give Panathinaikos the lead , although they eventually lost the game 5 â `` 1 . He was not selected initially for the 2006 World Cup , but he joined the French team to replace Djibril CissÃ , injured a few days before the start of the competition . Govou scored two goals in France 's 3 â `` 1 win over world champions Italy in a Euro 2008 qualifier . The game was the first meeting between the two teams since Italy beat France in the 2006 World Cup final . Govou scored his first goal by heading , just 67 seconds into the game . His second came in the 55th minute . He and his ex-girlfriend Pascale have a daughter named Naomy ( born 11 February 2005 ) .
1000 Ways to Die is an American docufiction television series that premiered on May 14 , 2008 on Spike . The program recreates unusual deaths and includes interviews with experts who describe the science behind each death . Up until the end of Season One , the final story of each episode showed actual footage of dangerous situations that almost ended in death , along with interviews with people involved in the situations . A portion of these deaths have been nominated for or have received a Darwin Award . 1000 Ways to Die takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to death through its presentation of stories derived from myths and science , and the show makes liberal use of Artistic license to significantly embellish or change the circumstances of real-life incidents that resulted in death for greater entertainment value . A frequently recurring motif is that of unsympathetic individuals ' choices backfiring on them , resulting in death . The show is filled with black humor ( particularly in the narration ) which tempers the otherwise somber theme of death . It portrays the deaths using live-action recreations of the events along with expert and sometimes witness testimony , also using graphic CGI animations , similar to those used in the popular television show CSI , to illustrate the ways people have died . A narration provides background information within each death-story , which all end with titles that are puns on popular figures of speech . A warning is displayed at the start of every episode and includes the statements : `` Do not attempt to try any of the actions depicted . You will die ! ''

ArgeÅ is a river of Southern Romania . It starts at the junction of headwaters Buda and Capra in the FÄ gÄ raÅ Mountains , in the Southern Carpathians and flows into the Danube at OlteniÅ # a. The main city on the ArgeÅ is PiteÅ ti . Upstream , it is retained by the Vidraru Dam , which has created Lake Vidraru . The river is believed to be the same as á 1\/2 Ï Î Î Ï Ï Ï Ï Ordessus , a name mentioned by Ancient Greek historian Herodotus . The etymology of ArgeÅ is not clear . Traditionally , it was considered that it 's derived from the ancient name , through a reconstructed term , \* Argessis . The capital of Dacian leader Burebista was named Argedava , but it appears that it has no link with the name for the river . An alternate etymology derives the name of the river from a Pecheneg word , transliterated into Romanian as argiÅ ( meaning `` higher ground '' ) . The earliest recorded variants of the name , referring to the city of Curtea de ArgeÅ ( lit . `` The Court on the ArgeÅ '' ) , also suggest a derivation from this word : Argyas ( 1369 ) , Argies ( 1379 ) , ArghiÅ ( 1427 ) , the river probably taking the name of the city . The following localities are situated along the river ArgeÅ , from source to mouth : CÄ pÄ Å # Ã cents nenii Ungureni , CÄ pÄ Å # Ã cents nenii PÄ mÃ cents nteni , Arefu , Poienarii de ArgeÅ , Corbeni , Rotunda , AlbeÅ tii de ArgeÅ , Curtea de ArgeÅ , BÄ iculeÅ ti , MeriÅ ani , Bascov , PiteÅ ti , GÄ eÅ ti , Bolintin-Deal , AdunaÅ # ii-Cop Ä ceni , and OlteniÅ # a. ArgeÅ has for its left tributaries : Buda , Valea cu PeÅ ti , Valea Lupului , Limpedea , Chiciura , Valea IaÅ ului , VÃ cents lsan , Valea Satului , RÃ cents ul Doamnei , RÃ cents ncaciov , CÃ cents rcinov , BudiÅ teanca , Sabar , CÃ cents lnÄ u , DÃ cents mboviÅ # a , Rasa , and Luica . Its tributaries on the right are Capra , CumpÄ na , Valea lui Stan , Arefu , BÄ neÅ ti , Valea Danului , Tutana , Schiau , Bascov , Neajlov and Zboiul .
The Peugeot 407 is a large family car produced by the French automaker Peugeot from 2004 to 2010 . It is available in saloon , coupÃ and estate variants , with both Diesel and petrol engines . The petrol engines range from 1.8 to 3.0-litres displacement , whereas the diesels range from 1.6 , 2.0 and 2.2-litre inline four cylinder engines to 2.7 and 3.0-litre V6 engines . The 407 , along with the larger 607 , was superseded by the 508 in early 2011 . According to the European Car of the Year website , the 407 was one of the runner-ups in the 2005 award . The 407 was the successor to the hugely successful Peugeot 406 , and was launched on May 27 , 2004 . The streamlined design of the car was seen as quite radical , its most distinctive features being its large front grille and the steeply raked screen pillars . The estate , known as the 407 SW , was launched four months after the saloon , whereas the coupÃ has been on sale since early 2006 . 407 has one of the most advanced suspensions in a class . With double wishbone in front and 5 point multilink with angled shock absorbers in the back . Although overall setup is for comfort , hence relatively soft , handling is excellent . Due to double wishbone\/multilink configuration it can out-turn ( especially in long , fast curves ) cars with much stiffer suspension and also same combination is reason for very predictable handling of change of dynamic load ( traverse bumps ) during cornering . The first advertisement , known as `` The Toys '' or `` Les Jouets '' , features life-size toy cars shown up by the sleek newly released Peugeot 407 . Directed by Philippe AndrÃ for French agency BETC Euro RSCG , the advert was filmed in Sydney , Australia ( we see cars crossing the Sydney Harbour Bridge ) . AndrÃ developed twenty model cars especially for the shoot . The soundtrack is provided by French duo , The Film , ( Guillaume BriÃ re and Benjamin Lebeau ) with their song Can You Touch Me , an adaptation of their earlier song , Can You Trust Me . The follow up ad features the same scenario of life-size toy cars in Sydney , this time taking a new Peugeot 407 SW out of the city to a beachside home . Along the way we see old and decrepit stationwagons breaking down or suffering from image problems . The soundtrack features ( Lady ) Hear Me Tonight by the Modjo . The commercials use the slogan Playtime is Over , which some perceive to be a retort to the Renault 's Laguna slogan Serious Playtime . In Spanish the slogan given at the end is Volvamos a hablar de automÃ viles , i.e. Let 's talk about cars again . The saloon version of the 407 was firstly previewed with the name `` 407 Elixir '' at the 2003 Frankfurt Motor Show . The `` 407 Silhouette '' is a race car with most design features of the current coupÃ . A version almost identical to the released coupÃ was presented at the 2005 Geneva Motor Show under the name `` 407 Prologue '' . The `` 407 Macarena '' is a four-door coupÃ convertible produced by Heuliez and presented at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show . In November 2009 Philippe Varin from PSA announced that the successor of the Peugeot 407 would be the Peugeot 508 , which was officially launched at the Paris Motor Show in October 2010 . The 508 saloon is approximately 12 cm ( 5 inches ) longer than the 407 and will also replace the larger Peugeot 607 . The Peugeot 408 name is used for a Chinese-built notchback version of the Peugeot 308 , that will replace 407 in America . The Peugeot 407 saloon has been produced by Majorette and Norev , while the Estate has only been produced by Norev . The coupe has been produced by Norev and Welly , and the `` 407 Elixr '' concept presented in the 2003 Frankfurt Motor Show has been produced only by Norev .

Canouan is an island in the Grenadines Islands belonging to St Vincent . It is a tiny island , measuring only 3.5 miles by 1.25 miles . A barrier reef runs along the Atlantic side of the island . The highest point on the island is Mount Royal . Two bays , Glossy and Friendship , separate the southern side of the Canouan Island . Canouan lies approximately 25 miles south of St. Vincent which , from 1871 to 1969 , was part of the British colony of the Windward Islands . Locals in need of supplies beyond basic staples routinely board cargo ships to make the two-to-three-hour passage to the main Island of Saint Vincent . A fast ferry service for the Grenadines commenced operations in June 2010 which reduces the journey to one hour . In 1979 , the island became independent with a secure democratic government based on the British system . History marks more than 200 years before year zero ; a cultivated tribe called the Arawaks arrived on bunker canoes to the island . These new residents brought fire-burners , plants and animals , basic farming and fishing skills with them . They lived in peace for 1500 years until a tribe of fierce fighters called the Caribs , invaded and killed the Arawak men and took off with their women . More than 200 years after Columbus laid eyes on St. Vincent , the Europeans established a kind of permanent settlement . Its mountainous and heavily forested geography allowed the Caribs to defend against European settlement here longer than on almost any other island in the Caribbean . After the Caribs were defeated on other islands they joined slaves who had escaped repression on Barbados by following the current of trade winds westward to St. Vincent , as well as those who had survived shipwrecks near St. Vincent and Bequia . The mixed descendants of the island warriors and the freed Africans ( who became known as the Black Caribs ) , with their common distrust and disgust for the Europeans , proved to be a fearsome foe . The Caribs feared complete domination so they allowed the French to construct a settlement on the island in 1719 . The French brought slaves to work their plantations . By 1748 , the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle officially declared St. Vincent and its surrounding islands to be a neutral island , controlled by neither Britain nor France . The two countries continued to contest control of the islands , however , until they were definitively ceded to the British in 1814 . In the early 1990s the CRDltd company was formed and secured lease for areas of the island to build 2 hotels - the current Raffles Resort site and Tamarind Hotel site . At this point the building arm of CRD ltd built roads throughout Canouan ( previously only dirt tracks ) , installed electricity to the island and residents houses and provided desalinated water for the first time . Locals who are not employed by the resort , however , are forbidden admittance to the property nowadays as it is private property . However the beaches remain public property and locals are allowed to use the beaches and can use access either through the resort or by boat . The two major resorts on Canouan , Raffles and the Tamarind , provide a stark contrast to life on the rest of the island . Outside the two resorts , wild dogs roam freely , along with chickens , goats , turtles , lizards , and the occasional bat . In 2004 Raffles began managing the Raffles Resort , which occupies 1\/3 of the island . The resort has a golf course , casino and 150 room hotel . The Raffles Golf Course won the Robb Reports best of the best Golf Courses in the World 2005 and consistently voted top course in the Caribbean . The Trump International Golf Club at Tamarind was designed by Jim Fazio . There are 2 schools on Canouan - the Government Primary school and the independent Pelican school used mainly - but not exclusively - by expatriate children . There is also an official Canouan Pre-school located close to the primary school . The runway at Canouan Airport has recently been lengthened to accommodate larger aircraft . It is now the jet port for the Grenadines . Moorings yacht charter company have their Grenadines base in Canouan in Grand Bay . Canouan was the one of the locations of the Sports Illustrated 09 Swimsuit edition . NBA player and political activist Adonal Foyle hails from Canouan , and former Prime Minister of St. Lucia Sir John Compton was born there .
Nuclear Blast is an independent record label and mail order record distributor with subsidiaries in Germany , the United States and Brazil . The record label was founded in 1987 by Markus Staiger in Germany . Originally releasing hardcore punk records , the label moved on to releasing albums by melodic death metal , grindcore , power metal and black metal bands , as well as tribute albums . Nuclear Blast is widely respected as the top label for the death metal scene , along with fellow non-RIAA label Century Media . The label 's main office is in Donzdorf , GÃ ppingen . Nuclear Blast America and Century Media work together as a strategic partnership between the two independent metal labels . They are distributed through Caroline\/EMI . At their inception , Nuclear Blast focused on releasing hardcore records by bands like Agnostic Front , Attitude and Stark Raving Mad . They progressed toward metal in 1990 , however , currently signing and distributing dozens of artists such as Dimmu Borgir and Hypocrisy . They have also released a series of compilation albums called `` Death Is Just the Beginning '' . Music from the Nuclear Blast label was featured in the 2005 movie Alone in the Dark . Nuclear Blast was formed in 1987 after founder Markus Staiger traveled throughout the United States for four weeks and saw a gig of his favorite band BL ` AST ! . The label was originally titled simply `` Blast '' , but this was soon changed to Nuclear Blast . The label 's first release was a vinyl compilation called Senseless Death ( NB 001 ) featuring US Hardcore bands like Attitude , Sacred Denial , Impulse Manslaughter and others . The first edition of 1000 copies was sold out after one year . Nuclear Blast started signing grindcore acts after Staiger discovered Las Vegas ' Righteous Pigs . This followed with releases by Atrocity , Deathstars , Master and ( Incubus ) Opprobrium , which all sold over 30,000 copies . The grindcore explosion is considered a landmark in the label 's history , gaining it worldwide attention which of course is just an opinion . In the early nineties , black metal became highly popular in the European underground , and Nuclear Blast signed many bands . Many of them , such as Dimmu Borgir and Dissection , are still signed to Nuclear Blast . The black metal trend became increasingly popular , and by 1996 , several Nuclear Blast-signed artists were entering European charts . By the end of 1997 , Nuclear Blast had 20 employees and mailed out a 100 page catalogue quarterly to 50 countries . In the late 1990s and early 2000s , they expanded into a direction of power metal , promoting bands such as HammerFall and the German power metal innovators Helloween . During the 2000s , Nuclear Blast started promoting some Finnish bands , such as Stratovarius and Sonata Arctica , and the German band Blind Guardian , expanding their style further into different subgenres of metal . Swedish band Meshuggah became the first band in the history of Nuclear Blast Records to crack the Billboard 200 , landing at # 165 with their 2002 album , Nothing . Meshuggah also became the first Nuclear Blast band to be reviewed in Rolling Stone magazine . The Label was featured in the 2006 German movie Heavy Metal auf dem Lande . In 2007 , Nuclear Blast released two discs to celebrate their 20th anniversary as a record label . The discs are intended to showcase the talent on their roster . The albums are much in the same vein as Roadrunner United . The first album , Into the Light features songs composed and written by Rage guitarist Victor Smolski with singers Tobias Sammet ( of Edguy ) , Peter `` Peavy '' Wagner ( Rage ) , Tony Kakko ( Sonata Arctica ) , Mats LevÃ n ( Therion ) , Marcel `` Schmier '' Schirmer ( Destruction ) , Hansi KÃ 1\/4 rsch ( Blind Guardian ) , Andi Deris ( Helloween ) , Oddleif Stensland ( Communic ) , Marco Hietala ( Nightwish ) , and Tarja Turunen ( ex-Nightwish ) .

Nuclear Blast has received widespread criticism , most notably the community at last . fm . For generalising the bands they sign , forcing the bands to make their music more mainstream . As well as releasing new content more frequently , giving the songwriters less time to polish the songs , and as a result lowering the standard of the product . Examples of this are the bands ; Nightwish , Sonata Arctica and Sonic Syndicate .
Non-fiction or nonfiction is an account , narrative , or representation of a subject which a person presents as fact . This presentation may be accurate or not ; that is , it can give either a true or a false account of the subject in question . However , it is generally assumed that the authors of such accounts believe them to be truthful at the time of their composition . Note that reporting the beliefs of others in a non-fiction format is not necessarily an endorsement of the ultimate veracity of those beliefs , it is simply saying that it is true that people believe that ( for such topics as mythology , religion ) . Non-fiction can also be written about fiction , giving information about these other works . Non-fiction is one of the two main divisions in writing , particularly used in libraries , the other being fiction . However , non-fiction need not be written text necessarily , since pictures and film can also purport to present a factual account of a subject . Essays , journals , documentaries , histories , scientific papers , photographs , biographies , textbooks , travel books , blueprints , technical documentation , user manuals , diagrams and some journalism are all common examples of non-fiction works , and including information that the author knows to be untrue within any of these works is usually regarded as dishonest . Other works can legitimately be either fiction or non-fiction , such as journals of self-expression , letters , magazine articles , and other expressions of imagination . Although they are mostly either one or the other it is possible for there to be a blend of both . Some fiction may include non-fictional elements . Some non-fiction may include elements of unverified supposition , deduction , or imagination for the purpose of smoothing out a narrative , but the inclusion of open falsehoods would discredit it as a work of non-fiction . The numerous literary and creative devices used within fiction are generally thought inappropriate for use in non-fiction . They are still present particularly in older works but they are often muted so as not to overshadow the information within the work . Simplicity , clarity and directness are some of the most important considerations when producing non-fiction . Audience is important in any artistic or descriptive endeavor but it is perhaps most important in non-fiction . In fiction , the writer believes that readers will make an effort to follow and interpret an indirectly or abstractly presented progression of theme , whereas the production of non-fiction has more to do with the direct provision of information . Understanding of the potential readers ' use for the work and their existing knowledge of a subject are both fundamental for effective non-fiction . Despite the truth of non-fiction it is often necessary to persuade the reader to agree with the ideas and so a balanced , coherent and informed argument is also vital . Mark Twain said , paraphrased : `` The difference between fiction and nonfiction is that fiction must be absolutely believable . '' Semi-fiction is fiction implementing a great deal of non-fiction , e.g. a fictional descriptions based on a true story . Cave paintings , from 32,000 years ago , are one of the oldest forms of human expression and could be either a record of what prehistoric man caught on hunting trips , i.e. non-fiction , or alternately a story expressing what they would like to catch on future occasions , i.e. fiction . If cave art is ambiguous on this matter , cuneiform inscriptions which hold the earliest writings seem to have been initially for non-fiction . Much of the non-fiction produced throughout history is of a mundane and everyday variety such as records and legal documents which were only ever seen by a few and are of little interest except to the historian . The non-fiction that transcends its original time tends to be viewed as either exceptionally well made or perfectly embodying the ideas , manners and attitudes of the time it was produced , even if it was not actually created as history . At any one time in history there is the body of non-fiction work which represents the currently accepted truths of the period . Although these non-fiction works may be contradictory they form a corpus that is regularly being altered with better explanations of ideas or with new facts . A good example of this are the non-fiction scientific books and papers which explain the science of the day but are then superseded by better representations . Textbooks for explaining and teaching the current state of scientific and historical knowledge are regularly updated and manuals for operating new technology are also produced .

Le PÃ re Fouettard ( French for The whipping Father ) is a character who accompanies St. Nicholas in his rounds during St. Nicholas ' Day ( 6 December ) dispensing lumps of coal and\/or floggings to the naughty children while St. Nick gives gifts to the well behaved . He is known mainly in the Eastern regions of France , although similar characters exist all over Europe ( see Companions of Saint Nicholas ) . This `` Whipping Father '' was said to bring a stick with him to spank all of the naughty kids who misbehaved . The most popular story about the origin of Le PÃ re Fouettard was first told in the year 1150 . An Inn Keeper ( or in other versions a butcher ) captures three boys who appear to be wealthy and on their way to enroll in a religious boarding school . Along with his wife , he kills the children in order to rob them . One gruesome version tells that they drug the children , slit their throats , cut them into pieces , and stew them in a barrel . St. Nicholas discovers the crime and resurrects the children . After this , Le PÃ re Fouettard repents and becomes St. Nick 's partner . A slightly altered version of this story claims that St. Nicholas forced Le PÃ re Fouettard to become his assistant as a punishment for his crimes . Another story states that during the siege of Metz ( a city in Eastern France ) in 1552 , an effigy of king Charles Quint was burned and dragged through the city . Meanwhile , an association of tanners created a grotesque character ( also a tanner ) armed with a whip and bound in chains that punished children . After Metz was liberated , the charred effigy of Charles Quint and the character created by the tanners somehow assimilated into what is now known as Le PÃ re Fouettard . Events surrounding the city 's liberation and the burning of the effigy coincided with the passage of St. Nicholas , hence Le PÃ re Fouettard became his `` bad cop '' counterpart . In the 1930s , Le PÃ re Fouettard appeared in the United States under the translated name Father Flog or Spanky . Although almost identical to the original French personification , Father Flog had nothing to do with Christmas and also had a female accomplice named Mother Flog . The two doled out specific punishments for specific childhood crimes ( e.g. cutting out the tongue for lying ) . Le PÃ re Fouettard is similar if not identical to numerous characters that perform the same function . Knecht Ruprecht , a tradition of the Germanic People , is probably the best known of these characters . In the Alsace region , Le PÃ re Fouettard is known as Hans Trapp . In Switzerland , Schmutzli is nearly identical . Hans Muff , Pelzebock , Drapp or Buzeberg are also used in various parts of Bavaria . In the Netherlands and Flanders they have Zwarte Piet , although he is n't as scary to kids . Similar traditions in the Alpine regions have characters that are more bestial and range from a goat to an actual demon or devil . The most popular of these characters is Krampus , other similar\/identical characters include Klaubauf , Bartel , Bellzebub , and Ä ert ( Devil ) . In some traditions , the bringer of gifts and the bringer of punishment are fused into one . Rumpelklas , Pelzebock , Pelznickel , Belzeniggl , and Belsnickel are examples of this tradition . In Alsace , Le PÃ re Fouettard is synonymous with the bogeyman . The most common depiction of Le PÃ re Fouettard would be of a man with a sinister face dressed in dark robes with scraggly unkempt hair and a long beard . He is armed with either a whip , a large stick , or with bundles of switches . Some incarnations of the character have him wearing a wicker back pack in which children can be placed and carried away . Sometimes he merely carries a large bundle of sticks on his back ( some speculate that the photograph on the cover of Led Zeppelin IV is Le PÃ re Fouettard ) . Often , his face is darkened to varying degrees . Some say it is because of his being born of a burned effigy , others say that it is from the soot in the chimneys that he goes down with St. Nicholas . In other representations , Le PÃ re Fouettard is identical to the Dutch character Zwarte Piet ( Black Peter ) . Further renderings of the character show him as being nearly identical to Saint Nicholas or Santa Claus , but wearing a black suit instead of a red one .

In January 2009 support for CELT was added to the Ekiga and FreeSWITCH VoIP programs . Free goods are what is needed by the society and is available without limits . The free good is a term used in economics to describe a good that is not scarce . A free good is available in as great a quantity as desired with zero opportunity cost to society . A good that is made available at zero price is not necessarily a free good . For example , a shop might give away its stock in its promotion , but producing these goods would still have required the use of scarce resources , so this would not be a free good in an economic sense . Earlier schools of economic thought proposed a third type of free good : resources that are so abundant in nature that there is enough for everyone to have as much as they want . Examples in textbooks included fresh water and the air that we breathe . However , these are now regarded as common goods because competition for them is rivalrous . Copyrights and patents have the effect of converting some goods to scarce goods by law . Although these goods are free goods ( in the economic sense ) once they have been produced , they do require scarce resources , such as skilled labor , to create them in the first place . Thus these laws are sometimes used to give exclusive rights to the creators of such `` intellectual property '' in order to encourage resources to be appropriately allocated to these activities .
Year 3 ( III ) was a common year starting on Monday or Tuesday ( link will display the full calendar ) of the Julian calendar ( the sources differ , see leap year error for further information ) and a common year starting on Monday of the Proleptic Julian calendar . At the time , it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Lamia and Servilius ( or , less frequently , year 756 Ab urbe condita ) . The denomination 3 for this year has been used since the early medieval period , when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years .
For the mathematical form of proof by contradiction , see Proof by contradiction . Reductio ad absurdum ( Latin : `` reduction to the absurd '' ) is a form of argument in which a proposition is disproven by following its implications logically to an absurd consequence . A common species of reductio ad absurdum is proof by contradiction ( also called indirect proof ) where a proposition is proved true by proving that it is impossible for it to be false . For example , if A is false , then B is also false ; but B is true , therefore A can not be false and therefore A is true . In practice such arguments are frequently premised on a false dichotomy making the ostensible proof a logical fallacy . The ontological argument for the existence of God , as it was originally stated by Anselm of Canterbury , is an example of reductio ad absurdum . Another example concerns the following statement , attributed to physicist Niels Bohr : `` The opposite of every great idea is another great idea . '' Carl Sagan used a reductio ad absurdum argument to counter this claim . If this statement is true , he argued , then it would certainly qualify as a great idea - it would automatically lead to a corresponding great idea for every great idea already in existence . But if the statement itself is a great idea , its opposite ( `` It is not true that the opposite of every great idea is another great idea '' , provided `` opposite '' is a synonym of `` negation '' in Bohr 's aphorism ) must also be a great idea . The original statement is disproven because it leads to an absurd conclusion : that an idea can be great regardless of whether it is true or false .
The Black-headed Grosbeak , Pheucticus melanocephalus , is a medium-size seed-eating bird in the same family as the Northern Cardinal , the Cardinalidae . It is sometimes considered conspecific with the Rose-breasted Grosbeak , P. ludovicianus , with which it hybridises on the Great Plains . The 19 cm long , 47 g weight Black-headed Grosbeak is a migratory bird , with nesting grounds from southwestern British Columbia , through the western half of the United States , into central Mexico . It occurs as an accidental further south in Central America . The Black-headed Grosbeak 's approximate length is 18 â `` 19 cm or 6 Â 1\/2 to 7 Â 3\/4 inches ; it is similar in size to a Common Starling . As per its name the male has a black head . It also has black wings and tail with prominent white patches . Its breast is dark to tawny orange in color . Its belly is yellow . The female has a brown head , neck and back with sparrow-like black streaks . She also has white streaks down the middle of her head , over her eyes and on her cheeks . Her breast is white and her wings and tail are greyish-brown with two white wing bars and yellowish wing edges . The Black-headed Grosbeak prefers to live in deciduous and mixed wooded areas . It likes to be in areas where there are large trees as well as thick bushes , such as patches of broadleaved trees and shrubs within conifer forests , including streamside corridors , river bottoms , lakeshores , wetlands , and suburban areas . It also seems to avoid coniferous vegetation . Females build nests among the dense foliage on an outer branch of tall broadleaved trees or shrubs , 3 -- 35 feet above ground . They will occasionally build in dense shrubs such as blackberry . The nest is in the shape of an open saucer , made of fine grass , rootlets twigs , bark and conifer needles . It is often lined with rootlets , hair , and fine plant material . The female lays 2 -- 5 pale green , blue or gray eggs that are spotted with reddish and dark brown . The eggs are incubated by the male and female for 12 -- 14 days . After the eggs have hatched the fledglings leave the nest in about 11 or 12 days , however they are unable to fly for another two weeks . The young are fed by both adults . The Black-headed Grosbeak 's monogamy is under study , but pair bonds generally last for only one breeding season . They typically have one brood per season , though double broods have been documented in foothills of the Sacramento Valley in California . The Grosbeakâ s song is a rich warble that is similar to that of an American Robin but more fluent , faster , softer , sweeter and mellow with rising and falling passages that make the song much longer than the Robinâ s. The note is a sharp ik or eek . Both the male and female sing , but have different songs . The Black-headed Grosbeak eats pine and other seeds , berries and insects , spiders and fruit . During the summer months it mostly eats spiders , snails and insects . It is one of the few birds that can safely eat the poisonous monarch butterfly . In their wintering grounds this grosbeak consumes many monarchs and many seeds . It will come to bird feeders for sunflower and other types of seed , and fruit . Black-headed Grosbeaks range from the Pacific coast to the middle of the US Great Plains and from south western Canada to the mountains of Mexico . US and Canadian are highly migratory , wintering in Mexico . In the Great Plains the range of the Black-headed Grosbeak and the Rose-breasted Grosbeaks overlap and have interbred somewhat . After the breeding season , they tend to seek out berry-rich areas . They migrate south early in the fall and return to the north late in the spring and have been known to do so in flocks . Black-headed Grosbeaks frequently sing from prominent perches . Both the male and female sing , but have different songs , and both are known to sing from the nest while incubating . When trying to court a female , males fly with their wings and tails spread . They forage in the foliage , on the ground or in low vegetation and are prominent berry eaters .

Darko KovaÄ eviÄ ( Serbian Cyrillic : Ð '' Ð Ñ Ð Ð 3\/4 Ð Ð 3\/4 Ð Ð Ñ Ð Ð Ð Ñ ) ( born 18 November 1973 in Kovin , Serbia , SFR Yugoslavia ) is a former Serbian football player . He is known for his spells at Real Sociedad where his partnership with Nihat Kahveci was one of the best in Spain . His key attributes are his strength and aerial ability . KovaÄ eviÄ also had positive spells with Juventus and Olympiakos . Beginning his career with his birth-town club FK RadniÄ ki Kovin , but was soon spoted by Zrenjanin based Serbian top league club FK Proleter and it became clear , at the young age of 19 , that KovaÄ eviÄ would become one of the country 's greatest ever goalscorers . Spending two seasons with the club , Darko managed over a goal every other game , and was quickly snatched up by Serbian giants Red Star Belgrade . KovaÄ eviÄ flourished at the Belgrade club , becoming one of Europe 's hottest prospects and earning a call-up to the Yugoslavia national team . Netting in an astonishing 37 goals in just 47 games , KovaÄ eviÄ was eventually picked up by Premier League club Sheffield Wednesday in December 1995 for Â # 2m . Given the opportunity to showcase his skills in one of the top leagues in Europe , Darko initially looked good , impressive in the air , and scoring 2 goals in one game against Bolton Wanderers in a 4 â `` 2 victory that saw him likened to Les Ferdinand , but the rest of his skills failed to leave any mark with the English club . KovaÄ eviÄ 's transfer turned out to be a disaster for Sheffield Wednesday as the striker managed only 4 goals in his lone half-season at the club . His move to Wednesday from Red Star was in July 2007 named # 10 on The 50 worst transfers in Premier League history list by British newspaper The Times . Hoping to reach top form once again , KovaÄ eviÄ moved to La Liga side Real Sociedad in 1996 . It was with the Spanish club that Darko put on some of his best performances and became one of Europe 's best once again . Larger clubs soon came calling , with Italian giants Juventus acquiring the big Serbian in 1999 . At the Turin based club , KovaÄ eviÄ found goals in both the Serie A and competitions such as the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup becoming their leading European goal scorer one season . Yet the Juventus management felt Darko was underachieving and soon both parties were looking for a move out of Italy , with clubs such as Rangers willing to offer Â # 12m for the Serbian 's services . In 2001 KovaÄ eviÄ spent a brief time with Lazio ( as part-swap deal with Marcelo Salas ) before moving back to Spain in the middle of the season . In 2001 KovaÄ eviÄ eventually returned to the club where he found his most success at , Real Sociedad . KovaÄ eviÄ would go on to spend 6 more seasons at the club , netting in 51 goals in his second spell with Sociedad . The 2006 â `` 07 season would be KovaÄ eviÄ 's last season with the Spanish side , ending in the club 's relegation . In 2007 KovaÄ eviÄ signed with Greek champions Olympiacos . KovaÄ eviÄ once again reached top form for the Piraeus based club , scoring 17 goals in the Greek Superleague to lead Olympiacos to the league championship , and adding 3 goals in the Champions League as the team reached as far as the Round of 16 . KovaÄ eviÄ scored twice in the UEFA Cup 1st round 5 â `` 0 home leg win against FC NordsjÃ lland . In early 2009 , he was diagnosed with a blocked artery ; he successfully underwent heart surgery to improve the flow of blood to his heart . His doctors have advised him that he should retire from football , and Kovacevic officially retired in May 2009 , playing a final friendly match for Olympiakos to celebrate the winning of the Greek domestic double . After his retirement he may take another role for the team . Then Darko Kovacevic and his children Darko Kovacevic jr and Stella Kovacevic who were at St. Lawrence College all went back to Spain . However , Kovacevic returned to Greece as he loved the country and worked for several months as a columnist . In June , 2010 the new president of Olympiakos , Evangelos Marinakis hired Kovacevic as a technical director for the club and he is also the manager of the Olympiacos U-21 team . KovaÄ eviÄ made 59 appearances for the then Yugoslavia national team . Beginning his international career in 1994 , KovaÄ eviÄ would go on to score 10 goals and compete in both EURO 2000 and FIFA World Cup 1998 .
The Brinell scale characterizes the indentation hardness of materials through the scale of penetration of an indenter , loaded on a material test-piece . It is one of several definitions of hardness in materials science . Proposed by Swedish engineer Johan August Brinell in 1900 , it was the first widely used and standardised hardness test in engineering and metallurgy . The large size of indentation and possible damage to test-piece limits its usefulness . The typical test uses a 10 m diameter steel ball as an indenter with a 3000 k force . For softer materials , a smaller force is used ; for harder materials , a tungsten carbide ball is substituted for the steel ball . The indentation is measured and hardness calculated as : The BHN can be converted into the ultimate tensile strength ( UTS ) , although the relationship is dependent on the material , and therefore determined empirically . The relationship is based on Meyer 's index ( n ) from Meyer 's law . If Meyer 's index is less than 2.2 then the ratio of UTS to BHN is 0.36 . If Meyer 's index is greater than 2.2 , then the ratio increases . BHN is designated by the most commonly used test standards ( ASTM E10-08 and ISO 6506-1 :2005 ) as HBW ( H from hardness , B from brinell and W from the material of the indenter , tungsten ( wolfram ) carbide ) . In former standards HB or HBS were used to refer to measurements made with steel indenters . When quoting a Brinell hardness number ( BHN or more commonly HB ) , the conditions of the test used to obtain the number must be specified . The standard format for specifying tests can be seen in the example `` HBW 10\/3000 '' . `` HBW '' means that a tungsten carbide ( from the chemical symbol for tungsten ) ball indenter was used , as opposed to `` HBS '' , which means a hardened steel ball . The `` 10 '' is the ball diameter in millimeters . The `` 3000 '' is the force in kilograms force .

Thomas Anthony `` Tom '' Hollander ( born 25 August 1967 ) is an English actor who has appeared in productions such as Enigma , Gosford Park , Cambridge Spies , Pride and Prejudice , Pirates of the Caribbean , In the Loop , Valkyrie , and upcoming action thriller , Hanna . Tom Hollander was born in Bristol and raised in Oxford , Oxfordshire . He attended the Dragon School and then Abingdon School . As a youngster , he was a member of the National Youth Theatre and the National Youth Music Theatre ( then known as The Children 's Music Theatre ) . In 1981 , at fourteen years of age , he was awarded the lead role in a BBC dramatization of Leon Garfield 's John Diamond . He read English at Selwyn College , Cambridge . He was a member of the Footlights and the president of the Marlowe Society . Fellow student Sam Mendes directed him in several plays while they were at Cambridge , including a critically acclaimed production of Cyrano de Bergerac ( which also featured future Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg ) . After finishing university and failing to secure a place at a drama school , he found work in theater nevertheless . Hollander won the 1992 Ian Charleson Award for his performance in The Way of the World at the Lyric Hammersmith Theatre . He had been nominated the previous year , and was again nominated for his performances in The Government Inspector in 1997 . Hollander 's film and television appearances include Absolutely Fabulous , Martha , Meet Frank , Daniel and Laurence , Wives and Daughters , Harry , Cambridge Spies , Gosford Park , The Lost Prince and Pride and Prejudice for which he received The Evening Standard Film Awards Comedy Award , and London Critics Circle Best Supporting Actor . He has worked repeatedly with Michael Gambon and Bill Nighy and is a good friend of James Purefoy . Although highly respected as a character actor and the recipient of several awards , many of his films will still play on his height ( 5 ' 5 '' \/ 165 cm ) . Hollander has created several memorable comedic characters that draw more on his physical energy and intensity than his height , such as the `` brilliantly foul-mouthed '' Leon in BBC Two 's Freezing , described in The Times as a `` braying swirl of ego and mania '' . Hollander has lent his vocal talents to a number of roles for BBC radio including Mosca in 2004 's Volpone for Radio 3 , and Frank Churchill in Jane Austen 's Emma for Radio 4 . He has voiced a young Joseph Merrick , the `` Elephant Man '' ; a disembodied head named Enzio in an urban gothic comedy and recently , Leon Theremin , the Russian inventor famous for the electronic instrument that bears his name . He provided the vocal texture for Anthony Burgess ' A Clockwork Orange recently with a `` smooth , almost lyrical , crisp voice '' that accomplished the task of rendering the extensive and unique slang of the book instantly understandable to readers . Hollander portrays Lord Cutler Beckett , the `` heavy '' in Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man 's Chest and Pirates of the Caribbean : At Worlds End . He returned to the stage with the premiere of Joe Penhall 's play Landscape with Weapon at the Royal National Theatre . He also appeared in the TNT miniseries The Company as Harold Adrian Russell Kim Philby , having previously played Guy Burgess in the BBC 's Cambridge Spies . In 2008 he made a notable cameo appearance as King George III in the HBO mini-series John Adams , and ended the year as a memorable Col. Heinz Brandt in Valkyrie . In 2009 , Hollander played a symphonic cellist in Joe Wright 's The Soloist . It was his second outing for Wright , who cast him to great effect as the fevered suitor Mr. Collins in 2005 's Pride and Prejudice . Hollander appeared in the lead role in Armando Iannucci 's In the Loop as Secretary of State for International Development Simon Foster MP , which opened 17 April 2009 ; and later in the TV series The Thick Of It made by the same team , though in a different role . He also appeared as John Ruskin in BBC2 's Desperate Romantics . In 2010 he took the lead role in a new sitcom about the vicar of an inner London church , Rev. , which he also helped create . Hollander lives in Notting Hill , London . He has dated Dixie Chassay , Daphne Guinness , and Fran Hickman in the past .
Saxony-Anhalt is a landlocked state of Germany . Its capital is Magdeburg and it is surrounded by the German states of Lower Saxony , Brandenburg , Saxony , and Thuringia . Saxony-Anhalt covers an area of 20447.7 k. It has a population of 2.34 million ( more than 2.8 million in 1990 ) . Saxony-Anhalt should not be confused with Saxony or Lower Saxony , also German states . Saxony-Anhalt is one of 16 states of Germany . It is located in the western part of eastern Germany . By size , it is the 8th largest state in Germany , and by population , the 10th largest . In the north , Saxony-Anhalt is dominated by plain . In the sparsely populated Altmark , old Hanseatic cities like Salzwedel , Gardelegen , Stendal , or TangermÃ 1\/4 nde are located . The transition from the Altmark region to the Elbe-B Ã rde-Heath region with its fertile , sparsely wooded Magdeburg BÃ rde is accomplished by the Colbitz-Letzlingen Heath and the DrÃ mling near Wolfsburg . In the Magdeburg BÃ rde you can find the cities of Haldensleben , Oschersleben ( Bode ) , Wanzleben , SchÃ nebeck ( Elbe ) , Aschersleben , and Magdeburg , from which the region derives its name . In the south-west , the Harz mountains are located , comprising the Harz National Park , the Harz foreland and the Mansfeld Land . The highest mountain in the vicinity is Brocken , with an elevation of 1,141 meters ( 3,735 ft ) , which at the same time is the highest elevation in northern Germany . In this area , one can find the cities of Halberstadt , Wernigerode , Thale , Eisleben , or Quedlinburg . Located at the River Saale and Unstrut in the south of the state , you find the winegrowing area Saale-Unstrut and the cities of Zeitz , Naumburg ( Saale ) , WeiÃ enfeld , and Freyburg ( Unstrut ) . Neighboring Saxony , you can find the metropolitan area of Halle ( Saale ) \/ Merseburg\/Bitterfeld-Wolfen ( called Chemiedreieck - chemical triangle ) which reaches to the Leipzig agglomeration . In former times , the chemical industry had its economical focus on this area around Leuna . Finally , in the east , Dessau-Ro Ã lau is situated at the River Elbe ( as is the capital Magdeburg ) amidst the Anhalt-Wittenberg region . The capital of Saxony-Anhalt is Magdeburg . It is the second largest city in the state , head-to-head with Halle . Saxony-Anhalt is subdivided into eleven rural districts and three urban districts . The current state was created by two districts reforms . By the first one in 1994 , 37 districts were reformed into 21 new districts . The last reform took place on January 1st , 2004 , when the 21 districts were reordered into now eleven districts . From 1994 to 2003 , Saxony-Anhalt was divided into 21 rural districts ( `` Landkreise '' ) . Above this level , there were three governmental districts ( Regierungsbezirke ) : Dessau , Halle and Magdeburg . On 1 January 2004 these three governmental districts were abolished . Saxony-Anhalt was formed as a province of Prussia in 1945 , from the territories of the former Prussian Province of Saxony ( except the Regierungsbezirk Erfurt ) , the Free State of Anhalt , the Free State of Brunswick ( CalvÃ rde and the eastern part of the former Blankenburg district ) and the formerly Thuringian town Allstedt . See the respective articles for the history of the area before 1945 . Anhalt takes its name from Anhalt Castle near Harzgerode ; the origin of the name of the castle remains unknown . When Prussia was disbanded in 1947 , the province became the state Saxony-Anhalt . It became part of the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) in 1949 . From 1952 to 1990 Saxony-Anhalt was divided into the East German districts of Halle and Magdeburg . In 1990 , in the course of German reunification , the districts were reintegrated as a state . Former Minister-president Wolfgang BÃ hmer ( CDU ) did not run for re-election . Saxony-Anhalt is famous for its good soil . The `` Magdeburger BÃ rde '' contains the best soil in all of Germany and some of the best of Europe . It is often said by the local populace that the smoothness of the soil is more luxurious than balls of silk . The food industry has an important role in this state . Some of the best known products are `` Baumkuchen '' from Salzwedel ( Altmark ) or `` Hallorenkugeln '' from Halle . In the industrial sector the chemical industry is quite important . One of the biggest chemical producing areas can be found around the cities of Wolfen and Bitterfeld . Because of the chemical industry , Saxony-Anhalt is the largest receiver of foreign direct investments in all of eastern Germany . Saxony-Anhalt is also the location of numerous `` wind farms '' throughout the state producing wind-turbine energy . In 2010 80 % of citizens in Saxony-Anhalt were undenominational and more were leaving the churches than entering them . In 2005 an estimated 14.2 % of all persons living in Saxony-Anhalt lived on the welfare lines , either receiving Arbeitslosengeld II or Sozialgeld . In 2006 36,1 % of all children younger than 15 lived on welfare ( Sozialgeld ) .
Rethymno ( Greek : Î Î Î Ï Î 1\/4 Î 1\/2 Î , , also Rethimno , Rethymnon , RÃ thymnon , and RhÃ thymnos ) is a city of approximately 40,000 people in Greece , the capital of Rethymno peripheral unit in the island of Crete . It was built in antiquity ( ancient Rhithymna and Arsinoe ) , even though was never a competitive Minoan center . It was , however , strong enough to mint its own coins and maintain urban growth . One of these coins is today depicted as the crest of the town with two dolphins in a circle . This region as a whole is rich with ancient history , most notably through the Minoan civilisation centred at Kydonia east of Rethymno . Rethymno itself began a period of growth when the Venetian conquerors of the island decided to put an intermediate commercial station between Heraklion and Chania , acquiring its own bishop and nobility in the process . Today 's old town ( palia poli ) is almost entirely built by the Venetians . It is one of the best preserved old towns in Crete . The town still maintains its old aristocratic appearance , with its buildings dating from the 16th century , arched doorways , stone staircases , Byzantine and Hellenic-Roman remains , the small Venetian harbor and narrow streets . The Venetian Loggia today houses the information office of the Ministry of Culture . A Wine Festival is held there annually at the beginning of July . Another festival is held on 7-8 November , in memory of the destruction of the Arkadi Monastery . The city 's Venetian-era citadel , the Fortezza , is one of the best-preserved castles in Crete . Other monuments include the Neratze mosque ( the Municipal Odeon arts center ) , the Great Gate ( Î Î Î Î Î '' Î Î Ï Ï Ï Î , Porta Guora ) , the Piazza Rimondi ( Rimondi square ) and the Venetian Loggia . The town was also captured by the Ottoman Turks in 1646 and was ruled by them for almost three centuries . The town ( Resmo in Turkish ) was the center of a sanjak during Ottoman rule . During the Battle of Crete , the Battle of Rethymno was fought between German Paratroopers and Australian and Greek forces . Although initially unsuccessful , the Germans won the battle after receiving reinforcements from Maleme . Today the city 's main income is from tourism , many new facilities having been built in the past 20 years . Agriculture is also notable , especially for olive oil and other Mediterranean products . It is also the base of the Philosophical School and the University Library of the University of Crete and the School of Social and Political Sciences having 8000 students on its University Campus per annum at `` Galos '' , where the Academic Institute of Mediterranean Studies is situated . The city has an Archaeological Museum and a Historical and Folklore Museum . Pandelis Prevelakis wrote Î Î Ï Ï Î Î 1\/2 Î Î Ï Î 1\/4 Î Î Ï Ï Î Î '' Î Ï Î Î Î Ï ( 1937 ) , The Chronicle of my Town , a nostalgic depiction of Rethymno from the period of the Cretan State ( 1898 ) to the expulsion of the Cretan Turks ( 1924 ) .
Sodium selenide is a inorganic compound of sodium and selenium with the chemical formula Na2Se . This colourless solid is prepared by the reaction of selenium with a solution of sodium in ammonia . Like other alkali metal chalcogenides , this material is highly sensitive to water , easily undergoing hydrolysis to give mixtures of the biselenide and hydroxide . This hydrolysis occurs because of the extreme basicity of the Se2 - ion . Similarly , sodium selenide is readily oxidized to polyselenides , a conversion signaled by off-white samples . Sodium selenide reacts with acids to produce toxic hydrogen selenide gas . The compound reacts with electrophiles to produce the selenium compounds . With alkyl halides , one obtains a variety of organoselenium compounds :

The South Caucasus is a geopolitical region located on the border of Eastern Europe and Southwest Asia also referred to as Transcaucasia , or The Transcaucasus . More specifically , the South Caucasus area spans the southern portion of the Caucasus Mountains and its lowlands , lying between the two continents of Europe and Asia and extending from the southern part of the Greater Caucasus Mountain range of southwestern Russia and going southerly to the Turkish and Armenian borders , traveling between the Black and Caspian Seas . The area includes the southern part of the Greater Caucasus Mountain range , the entire Lesser Caucasus Mountain range , the Colchis Lowlands and Kura-Aras Lowlands , the Talysh Mountains , the Lenkoran Lowlands , Javakheti and the Armenian highlands . The Transcaucasus , or South Caucasus area , is a part of the entire Caucasus geographical region that essentially divides the Eurasian transcontinent into two . All of Armenia is in Southern Caucasus ; the majority of Georgia and Azerbaijan , including the exclave of NaxÃ ivan , fall within this area . The countries of the region are producers of oil , manganese ore , tea , citrus fruits , and wine . In Western languages , the terms Transcaucasus and Transcaucasia are translations of the Russian zakavkazie meaning `` the area beyond the Caucasus Mountains '' , i.e. , as seen from the Russian capital ( analogous to the Roman terms Transalpine and Transpadania ) . The region remains one of the most complicated in the post-Soviet area , and comprises three heavily disputed areas â `` Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia , and Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan . Several wars , including the 2008 South Ossetia war , Ossetian-Georgian conflict , and the Nagorno-Karabakh war have been waged in this region . Located on the peripheries of Turkey , Iran and Russia , the region has been an arena for political , military , religious , and cultural rivalries and expansionism for centuries . However , throughout history the Caucasus has usually been incorporated in political entities belonging to the Iranian world , at the beginning of the 13th\/19th century Russia took it , along with the Transcaucasus , from the Qajars ( 1133-1342\/1779 -1924 ) , severing those historical ties . Ancient kingdoms of the region included Armenia , Albania , and Iberia , among others . These kingdoms were later incorporated into various Iranian empires , including Achaemenid Empire , Parthian Empire , Sassanid Empire , during which Zoroastrianism followed by Eastern Christianity became the dominant religions in the region . In 8th century A.D. , most of South Caucasus became part of the Caliphate and Islam spread throughout the region . In the middle centuries , kingdom of Georgia dominated the most of South Caucasus . The region was later conquered by the Seljuks , Mongols , local Turkic dynasties , Safavid dynasty . In the first quarter of 19th century , after two Russo-Persian wars , the region was conquered by Russian Empire . The region was unified as a single political entity twice â `` during the Russian Civil War ( Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic ) from 9 April 1918 to 26 May 1918 , and under the Soviet rule ( Transcaucasian SFSR ) from 12 March 1922 to 5 December 1936 . Transcaucasia , in particular where modern day Georgia and Armenia are located , is one of the native areas of the wine producing vine Vitis vinifera . Some experts speculate that it may be the birthplace of wine production . Archeological excavation and carbon dating of grape pips from the area have dated back to 7000-5000 BC .

The Sierra Nevada ( meaning `` snowy range '' in Spanish ) is a mountain range in the region of provinces of Granada and AlmerÃ a in Spain . It contains the highest point of continental Spain , MulhacÃ n at 3478 m ( 11,411 ft. ) above sea level . It is a popular tourist destination , as its high peaks make skiing possible in one of Europe 's most southerly ski resorts , in an area along the Mediterranean Sea predominantly known for its warm temperatures and abundant sunshine . At its foothills is found the city of Granada and , a little further , AlmerÃ a and MÃ laga . Parts of the range have been included in the Sierra Nevada National Park . The range has also been declared a biosphere reserve . The Sierra Nevada Observatory is located on the northern slopes at an elevation of 2800 m ( 9186 ft. ) . The Sierra Nevada was formed during the Alpine Orogeny , a mountain-building event that also formed the European Alps to the east and the Atlas Mountains of northern Africa across the Mediterranean Sea to the south . The Sierra as observed today formed during the Tertiary Period ( 65 to 1.8 million years ago ) from the collision of the African and Eurasian continental plates . Central to the mountain range is a ridge running broadly west-south-west - east-north-east . For a substantial distance , the watershed stays consistently above 3000 m ( 9842 ft. ) . On the southern side of the range , several long but narrow river valleys lead off towards the south-west , separated by a number of subsidiary ridges . On the steeper and craggier northern side , the valleys have less regular orientations . This side is dominated by the Rio Genil which starts near MulhacÃ n and into which many of the other rivers flow .

A muster drill ( also sometimes referred to as a lifeboat drill or a boat drill ) is an exercise conducted by the crew of a ship prior to embarking on a voyage . The purpose of a muster drill is to prepare passengers for safe evacuation in the event of an emergency while onboard the ship and to familiarize crew and passengers with escape routes . In a muster drill , passengers are educated on the use of life vests and escape routes from the ship . It is typically conducted approximately 30 minutes prior to the ship 's scheduled departure time and all guests must remain silent during the drill so that everyone will be able to hear the safety announcements from the Captain . During the drill , the ship 's general emergency signal ( seven short blasts , followed by one long blast ) is sounded to notify passengers . By international law , a passenger muster drill must be conducted by the ship within 24 hours of departure , but many cruise lines choose to conduct the drill before the ship departs port for the first time . It is the responsibility of the crew to ensure that a muster drill is held , and that every passenger and crew member is aware that it is being held . If a muster drill can not be held , a report in the log book must be made stating the circumstances . Laws in some places hold crew members liable to face civil charges if they voluntarily do not attend the muster drill . For example , in some U.S. states , those who do not attend are fined varying amounts , depending on their rank . Muster drills are typically not conducted and are not usually required on short trips on the water , including ferries , dinner cruises , or riverboats . An announcement is normally made to passengers , informing them that a mandatory muster drill will begin shortly . After this , another announcement is made , informing crew and passengers , that the `` General Emergency Alarm '' is about to be sounded , for exercise purposes only . After the alarm has been sounded , passengers are told to retrieve their life jackets if they are near their cabins , then make their way to their Muster Station . The `` General Emergency Alarm '' is 7 short and 1 long beep or whistle , which is sounded by the ship 's horn and , in most cases , by the ship 's internal alarm and PA systems with a tone . The muster drill must take place within 24 hours of passengers boarding the ship . Its length will vary depending on the size of the ship and cooperation of passengers .

Pont - Ã - Celles is a Walloon municipality located in the Belgian province of Hainaut . On January 1 , 2006 , Pont - Ã - Celles had a total population of 16,292 . The total area is 55.73 kmÂ which gives a population density of 292 inhabitants per kmÂ . Buzet , Liberchies , Luttre , Obaix , Pont - Ã - Celles ( village that gave its name to the municipality ) , Thimeon , Viesville . Pont - Ã - Celles draws its name from Latin Cella , meaning room or cell of monk , probably because of the presence of the monastery founded in VIIe century , by Saint Amand ( apostle of Belgium ) . The jurisdiction on which this primitive monastery was established , and then the priory of the Park , was called Celles , and later Pont - Ã - Celles . The name of Pont - Ã - Celles appears for the first time during the 16th century , when the monks of the Park built a bridge on the Pieton river near to the church . The parishioners of Luttre and Hairiamont then had to cross the bridge for going to service ( bridge to Celles , Pont - Ã - Celles ) . Gradually , this name extended to all the parish whose territory covered six seigniories . When in 1795 , the French replaced these six seigniories by a newly created municipality , they adopted the name of the parish ( Pont - Ã - Celles ) . In 1815 , after the defeat of Napoleon in Waterloo , our territories were annexed to The Netherlands . With this occasion , the department of Jemappes ( to which belonged Pont - Ã - Celles ) became the province of Hainaut . The famous Jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt was born in Liberchies . Every May , the community honors him with the open air Django Reinhardt Jazz Festival .

Lucien Laurent ( 10 December 1907 -- 11 April 2005 ) was a French association football player . He is famous for having scored the first ever FIFA World Cup goal . Laurent was born in Saint-Maur-des-Foss Ã s , Val-de-Marne , near Paris . Between 1921 and 1930 , he played for the semi-professional team Cercle AthlÃ tique de Paris , before being taken on by Sochaux , then a works team for the car manufacturer Peugeot , where he worked . As an amateur player , he only received basic expenses from the French Football Federation while at the tournament in Uruguay . It was in Uruguay that Laurent made history by scoring the first ever World Cup goal : a volley in the 19th minute of a game against Mexico on 13 July 1930 . France won the game 4-1 , but lost their remaining group matches to Argentina and Chile , and were thus eliminated . Laurent was ruled out of the third game due to injury . Injury then also denied Laurent a place in the squad for the 1934 World Cup and he moved to Rennes , playing for them until 1937 , then for RC Strasbourg until 1939 . In all , Laurent played 10 times for France , but scored only one other goal . When World War II came , Laurent was called up to join the armed forces and was taken prisoner by the Germans .

He was the only surviving member of the 1930 French team to see France lift the 1998 World Cup on home soil , and died seven years later at the age of 97 in BesanÃ on .
Bosconian was a multi-directional shooter arcade game that was developed by Namco in 1981 . It runs on Namco Galaga hardware but with a video system like that used in Rally-X . The object of Bosconian is to score as many points as possible by destroying enemy bases and ships . The player controls a small fighter ship that can move in eight directions and can fire both forward and backward . Each level consists of a number of green space stations that must all be destroyed to advance to the next level ( a semi-transparent mini-map helps identify their location ) . Each station consists of six cannons arranged in a hexagon , surrounding a central core . The player must either destroy all six cannons or shoot the core to destroy a station , and in later levels the core is capable of defending itself . Additionally , the player must avoid or destroy asteroids , mines , and a variety of enemy missiles and ships that attempt to collide with the player 's ship . Enemies occasionally launch formation attacks â '' destroying the leader causes all remaining enemies to disperse , but destroying all enemies in a formation scores extra bonus points . A spy ship ( worth a random bonus value ) also appears occasionally , which must be destroyed or the enemies will go berserk . Like many games made during the Golden Age of Arcade Games , the game has no definite end , continuing until the player has lost all of his\/her lives . Similar to Galaga , Bosconian `` rolls over '' from Level 255 to Level 0 , causing the game to behave abnormally during this level . If the player can successfully complete Level 0 , the game continues to Level 1 as though the player had started a new game . Also , after the first ten levels , some of the previous levels will repeat in placement of the space stations ( the only differences are the direction of the opening in the stations , the number of asteroids astray in the levels , and an increase in the number of enemy ships needed to be fought off ) . It was ported to several computer systems , including the Sharp X68000 , MSX , Commodore 64 and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum , and later appeared in several of Namco 's Namco Museum compilations for PlayStation and other consoles . The game has also been seen in Jakks Pacific 's TV game controllers . A home computer sequel , Bosconian ' 87 , was released in 1987 for the Amstrad CPC , Commodore 64 , and ZX Spectrum . An arcade sequel of sorts called Blast Off was released in 1989 only in Japan , a vertical-scrolling shooter which had more in common gameplay-wise with Namco 's own Dragon Spirit than with Bosconian . Dedicated Bosconian arcade machines have become somewhat of a rarity for arcade collectors , because many of them were converted to other , more profitable games over the years . Galaga was the most common conversion choice , because it uses the same basic hardware platform and wiring harness as Bosconian . Bosconian was the first game to include the now-standard continue screen and timer at the end of a game , giving a player who just lost his\/her last life a certain number of seconds to insert more money to continue the game from the same level . The continue feature could also be disabled entirely for arcade owners who did not want it by changing a DIP Switch setting . However , there is some debate over whether Bosconian or Tempest should be credited as the first video game to introduce the concept of continuing . Tempest is the older of the two games , but it did not have a continue screen and timer . Instead , it gave the player a choice of starting levels at the beginning of the game , up to the highest level currently unlocked on the machine . If it was the same player as the previous game , then he\/she could opt to `` continue '' by selecting the same level where the previous game ended . Any future Tempest player was also free to start a new game at the higher level , though , whereas once Bosconian 's continue timer expired , the next person to play had no choice but to start over at Level 1 .

Safe mode is a diagnostic mode of a computer operating system ( OS ) . It can also refer to a mode of operation by application software . Safe mode is intended to fix most , if not all problems within an operating system . Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X are examples of contemporary operating systems that implement a safe mode ( called `` Safe Boot '' in Mac OS X ) ; as well as other complex electronic devices . An operating system in safe mode will have reduced functionality , but the task of isolating problems is easier because many non-core components are disabled ( turned off ) . An installation that will only boot into its safe mode typically has a major problem , such as disk corruption or the installation of poorly configured software that prevents the operating system from successfully booting into its normal operating mode . Though it varies by operating system , typically safe mode loads as few executable modules as possible and usually disables devices , except for the minimum necessary to display information and accept input . Safe mode can also take the form of a parallel `` miniature '' operating system that has no configuration information shared with the normal operating system . For example , on Microsoft Windows , the user can also choose to boot to the Recovery Console , a small text-based troubleshooting mode kept separate from the main operating system ( and can also be accessed by booting the install CD ) , or to various `` safe mode '' options that run the dysfunctional operating system , but with features such as video drivers , audio and networking disabled . Safe mode typically provides access to utility and diagnostic programs so a user can troubleshoot what is preventing the operating system from working normally . Safe mode is intended for maintenance , not functionality , and provides minimal access to features . Microsoft Windows ' safe mode is accessed by pressing the F8 key as the operating system boots . Also , in a multi-boot environment with multiple versions of Windows installed side by side , the F8 key can be pressed at the OS selector prompt to get to safe mode . An equivalently minimal setting in Unix-like operating systems is single-user mode , in which daemons and the X Window System are not started , and only the root user can log in and which allows a administrative account commonly known as `` root '' to have its password reset without knowing what it is first . On Mac OS versions 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 , a similar mode is achieved by holding down the shift key while booting , which starts the system without extensions . In Mac OS X holding the shift key after powering up activates Safe Boot that has background maintenance features ( Besides the mode selection , it runs a file system repair , and in Mac OS 10.4 , it disables all fonts other than those in \/ System\/Library\/Fonts , moves to the Trash all font caches normally stored in \/ Library\/Caches\/com . apple . ATS \/ ( uid ) \/ , where ( uid ) is a user ID number such as 501 , and disables all startup items and any Login Items ) and can reset an administrative accounts ' password . In Windows , safe mode with networking , one of the variations of safe mode , can be used to troubleshoot network issues . In OS X , Safe Boot always includes networking . Application software sometimes offers a safe mode as well . In the PHP interpreter , prior to version 6 , safe mode offers stricter security measures . Mozilla Firefox 's safe mode allows the user to remove extensions which may be preventing the browser from loading . Internet Explorer can run in `` No Add-Ons '' mode and Protected Mode .

Most of the time , the wicket is one of the two sets of three stumps and two bails at either end of the pitch . The wicket is guarded by a batsman who , with his bat , attempts to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket . The origin of the word is from the standard definition of wicket as a small gate . Historically , cricket wickets had only two stumps and one bail and looked like a gate . The third ( middle ) stump was introduced in 1775 . Wicket also refers to the event of a batsman getting out . The batsman is said to have lost his wicket . If dismissed by a bowler , the bowler is said to have taken his wicket . The number of wickets taken is the primary measure of a bowler 's ability . For a batsman to be dismissed by being bowled , run out , stumped or hit wicket , his wicket needs to be put down . What this means is defined by Law 28 of the Laws of cricket . The wicket is put down if a bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps , or a stump is struck out of the ground by the ball , the striker 's bat , the striker 's person ( or by any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached from his person ) , a fielder ( with his hand or arm , and providing that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used , or in the hand of the arm so used ) . The wicket is also put down if a fielder pulls a stump out of the ground in the same manner . If one bail is off , removing the remaining bail or striking or pulling any of the three stumps out of the ground is sufficient to put the wicket down . A fielder may remake the wicket , if necessary , in order to put it down to have an opportunity of running out a batsman . If however both bails are off , a fielder must remove one of the three stumps out of the ground with the ball , or pull it out of the ground with a hand or arm , providing that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used , or in the hand of the arm so used . If the umpires have agreed to dispense with bails , because , for example , it is too windy for the bails to remain on the stumps , the decision as to whether the wicket has been put down is one for the umpire concerned to decide . After a decision to play without bails , the wicket has been put down if the umpire concerned is satisfied that the wicket has been struck by the ball , by the striker 's bat , person , or items of his clothing or equipment separated from his person as described above , or by a fielder with the hand holding the ball or with the arm of the hand holding the ball . The sequence of time over which two particular batsmen bat together , a partnership , is referred to as a specifically numbered wicket when discriminating it from other partnerships in the innings . A team can win a match by a certain number of wickets . This means that they were batting last , and reached the winning target with a certain number of batsmen still not dismissed . A team 's innings ends when ten batsmen are dismissed , so , for example , if the side scored the required number of runs to win with only three batsmen dismissed , they are said to have won by seven wickets . The word wicket is also sometimes used to refer to the cricket pitch itself . According to the Laws of Cricket , this usage is incorrect , but it is in common usage and commonly understood by cricket followers . This usage probably derives from the days when the outfield was kept short by grazing sheep on it and the playing surface , which was specially prepared , was protected from them by a light wicker fence around it . Since many regular grounds had resident bat-makers it is quite possible that the branches cut off from the willow wood used for the bats formed all or part of this fence . The term sticky wicket refers to a situation in which the pitch has become damp , typically due to rain or high humidity . This makes the path of the ball more unpredictable thus making the job of defending the stumps that much more difficult . The full phrase is thought to have originally been `` to bat on a sticky wicket . '' Such pitches were commonplace at all levels of the game ( i.e. up to Test Match level ) until the late 1950s . The arches used in croquet and roque are sometimes referred to as wickets , especially in American English . These arches descend from the ancestral game of ground billiards ( which may also be related to cricket ) , and were formerly called the hoop , arch or port . The port remained a prominent feature of indoor table billiards until well into the 18th century .
Lysithea is a prograde irregular satellite of Jupiter . It was discovered by Seth Barnes Nicholson in 1938 at Mount Wilson Observatory and is named after the mythological Lysithea , daughter of Oceanus and one of Zeus ' lovers .

Nymphaea is a genus of aquatic plants in the family Nymphaeaceae . There are about 50 species in the genus , which has a cosmopolitan distribution . The common name , shared with some other genera in the same family , is Water Lily . The name Nymphaea comes from the Greek term '' Î Ï Î 1\/4 Ï Î Î Î '' , possibly related to '' Î Ï Î 1\/4 Ï Î '' meaning `` nymph '' . The nymphs in Greek mythology were supernatural feminine beings associated with springs , so the application of the name to delicately flowered aquatic plants is understandable . Nymphaea leaves have a radial notch from the circumference to the petiole ( leaf stem ) in the center . Despite their name , water-lilies are not related to the true lilies ( family Liliaceae ) . The name `` lily '' is applied to a number of plants that are not at all closely related , such as day lilies , spider lilies and arum lilies , in addition to the water lilies . Nymphaea ( Egyptian lotuses ) are also not related to the Chinese and Indian lotus of genus Nelumbo , which are used in Asian cooking and sacred to Hinduism and Buddhism . However , the genus Nymphaea is closely related to Nuphar , another genus commonly called `` lotus '' . In Nymphaea , the flower petals are much larger than the sepals , whereas in Nuphar the petals are much smaller than its sepals . The fruit maturation also differs , with Nymphaea fruit sinking below the water level immediately after the flower closes , whereas Nuphar fruit are held above water level to maturity . Both genera share leaves with a radial notch from the circumference to the petiole ( leaf stem ) in the center . The ancient Egyptians revered the Nile water-lilies , or lotuses as they were also called . The lotus motif is a frequent feature of temple column architecture . The Egyptian Blue Water-lily , N. caerulea , opens its flowers in the morning and then sinks beneath the water at dusk , while the Egyptian White Water-lily , N. lotus , flowers at night and closes in the morning . This symbolizes the Egyptian separation of deities and is a motif associated with Egyptian beliefs concerning death and the afterlife . The recent discovery of psychedelic properties of the blue lotus may also have been known to the Egyptians and explain its ceremonial role . Remains of both flowers have been found in the burial tomb of Ramesses II . A syrian terra-cotta plaque from the 14th-13th century B.C.E. shows the goddess Asherah holding two lotus blossoms . An ivory panel from the 9th-8th century B.C.E. shows the god Horus seated on a lotus blossom , flanked by two Cherubs . The French painter Claude Monet is famous for his paintings of water lilies . Many of the water-lilies familiar in water gardening are hybrids .

Ernest `` Ernie '' Arthur Coombs , CM ( November 26 , 1927-September 18 , 2001 ) was a children 's entertainer , best known for the long-running Canadian television series Mr. Dressup . Ernest Coombs was born in Lewiston , Maine , and pursued a career in children 's entertainment after attending North Yarmouth Academy in Yarmouth , Maine . As an understudy to Fred Rogers , he traveled to Canada in 1963 to work for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on an early version of Mister Rogers ' Neighborhood . Rogers moved back to the United States the following year , but Coombs decided to stay in Canada , joining a new show called Butternut Square . Butternut Square ran from 1964 to 1967 . After Butternut Square ended , Coombs developed Mr. Dressup , which became one of English Canada 's longest-running and most beloved children 's programs . As Mr. Dressup , he presented arts and crafts , songs , stories and games for children with his friends Casey and Finnegan , a child and a dog who lived in a treehouse in Mr. Dressup 's back yard . Casey was n't given a unisex name intentionally , but it was a serendipitous choice because the character 's childlike voice left Casey 's gender ambiguous . Over the years , when viewers would ask Coombs whether Casey was a boy or a girl , he would ask , `` What do you think ? '' However the questioner responded , he would say , `` You 're right ! '' Later in the series , when the show 's principal puppeteer , Judith Lawrence , retired , Casey and Finnegan were replaced by a small cast of anthropomorphic animal puppets . Coombs believed very strongly in gentle , wholesome children 's programming that encouraged kids to use their creativity and imagination . In each episode , Mr. Dressup would dress up ( hence his name ) in a costume from his Tickle Trunk , and lead children in an imagination game . Many times his puppets would also appear in costume as well . Coombs became a Canadian citizen in 1994 . The series continued production until its final taping in February 1996 , when Coombs retired . The same year , he was named a Member of the Order of Canada . Repeats continued to be shown on CBC Television until they were discontinued in 2006 . After retirement , Coombs continued to work as an entertainer , playing roles in Ross Petty 's Christmas pantomimes of Peter Pan , Cinderella and Aladdin , and acted as a spokesman for children 's charities . Coombs also did a traveling stage show called `` Tales from the Tickle Trunk . '' In this show he would share stories about the making of the Mr. Dressup show , as well as the origins , and fates , of some of the characters . Coombs lived with his family in the Toronto suburb of Pickering . His wife Marlene ran a day care in downtown Toronto , called the Butternut Day Care . She was killed in a traffic accident in 1992 ; she was walking on the sidewalk of Yonge Street in Toronto , when a car hit her . The driver may have had a seizure causing the vehicle , resulting in a loss of control . Coombs suffered a stroke on September 10 , 2001 , and died on September 18 , 2001 in Toronto , Ontario at the age of 73 .

Acacia baileyana , commonly known as Cootamundra Wattle , is a shrub or tree in the genus Acacia . The scientific name of the species honors the botanist Frederick Manson Bailey . It is indigenous to a small area of southern New South Wales in Australia , but it has been widely planted in other Australian states . In many areas of Victoria , Cootamundra Wattle has become naturalised and is regarded as a weed , out-competing indigenous Victorian species . Almost all wattles have cream to golden flowers . The small flowers are arranged in spherical to cylindrical inflorescences , with only the stamens prominent . Wattles have been extensively introduced into New Zealand . A. baileyana is used in Europe in the cut flower industry . It is also used as food for bees in the production of honey . Less than 0.02 % alkaloids were found in a chemical analysis of Acacia baileyana . This plant is adaptable and easy to grow . Unfortunately it has an ability to naturalise ( i.e. escape ) into surrounding bushland . Also , it hybridises with some other wattles , notably the rare and endangered Sydney Basin species Acacia pubescens . A prostrate weeping form is in cultivation . Its origin is unknown , but it itself is a popular garden plant , its cascading horizontal branches good for rockeries . The fine foliage of the original Cootamundra wattle is grey-green , but a blue-purple foliaged form , known as ` Purpurea ' is very popular . The color Cootamundra Wattle is used currently by the Australian Capital Territory Fire Brigade as their color scheme for firefighting appliances .

Wintonotitan ( meaning `` Winton titan '' ) is a genus of titanosauriform dinosaur from late Albian ( Early Cretaceous ) - age rocks of Australia . It is known from partial postcranial remains . Fossils that are now known under the name Wintonotitan were first found in 1974 by Keith Watts . At the time , the specimens were assigned to an Austrosaurus sp . , Austrosaurus then being the only named Australian Cretaceous sauropod genus . These fossils , catalogued as QMF 7292 , consisted of a left shoulder blade , much of the forelimbs , a number of back , hip , and tail vertebrae , part of the right hip , ribs , chevrons , and unidentifiable fragments . QMF 7292 was established as the type specimen of Wintonotitan in 2009 by Scott Hocknull and colleagues . The type species is W. wattsi , honoring the original discoverer . A phylogenetic analysis found Wintonotitan to be a basal titanosauriform sauropod , in a comparable part of the titanosauriform tree to Phuwiangosaurus . QMF 7292 was found about 60 k northwest of Winton , near Elderslie Station . A second specimen , QMF 10916 , consisting of isolated tail vertebrae , was found at Chorregan . Both were recovered from the lower part of the Winton Formation , dated to the latest Albian . QMF 7292 was found in sandstone interpreted as a point bar of a river . Also found at the site were fish fragments , a theropod tooth , and a variety of plant fossils , including woody stems , branch impressions , cones and cone scales , and pieces of leaves . The Winton Formation had a faunal assemblage including bivalves , gastropods , insects , the lungfish Metaceratodus , turtles , the crocodilian Isisfordia , pterosaurs , and several types of dinosaurs , such as the theropod Australovenator , the sauropod Diamantinasaurus , and unnamed ankylosaurians and hypsilophodonts . Wintonotitan bones can be distinguished from Diamantinasaurus bones because Wintonotitan bones are not as robust . Plants known from the formation include ferns , ginkgoes , gymnosperms , and angiosperms . Like other sauropods , Wintonotitan would have been a large quadrupedal herbivore .

A Pyrrhic victory is a victory with devastating cost to the victor ; it carries the implication that another such victory will ultimately cause defeat . The phrase is named after King Pyrrhus of Epirus , whose army suffered irreplaceable casualties in defeating the Romans at Heraclea in 280 BC and Asculum in 279 BC during the Pyrrhic War . After the latter battle , Plutarch relates in a report by Dionysius : In both of Pyrrhus 's victories , the Romans suffered greater casualties than Pyrrhus did . However , the Romans had a much larger supply of men from which to draw soldiers , so their casualties did less damage to their war effort than Pyrrhus 's casualties did to his . The report is often quoted as `` Another such victory and I come back to Epirus alone , '' or `` If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans , we shall be utterly ruined . '' Although it is most closely associated with a military battle , the term is used by analogy in fields such as business , politics , law , literature , and sports to describe any similar struggle which is ruinous for the victor . For example , the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr , writing of the need for coercion in the cause of justice , warned , `` Moral reason must learn how to make coercion its ally without running the risk of a Pyrrhic victory in which the ally exploits and negates the triumph . '' Further , in Beauharnais v. Illinois , a United States Supreme Court decision involving a charge under an Illinois statute proscribing group libel , Justice Black , in his dissent , warned that '' ( i ) f minority groups who hail this holding as their victory , they might consider the possible relevancy of this ancient remark : ` Another such victory and I am undone . ' ''

Mineral water is water containing minerals or other dissolved substances that alter its taste or give it therapeutic value , generally obtained from a naturally occurring mineral spring or source . Dissolved substances in the water may include various salts and sulfur compounds . Mineral water can be sparkling ( with effervescence ) , or still ( without effervescence ) . Traditionally , mineral waters were used or consumed at their source , often referred to as `` taking the waters '' or `` taking the cure , '' at sites such as spas , baths or wells . The term spa was used for a place where the water was consumed and bathed in ; bath where the water was used primarily for bathing , therapeutics , or recreation ; and well where the water was to be consumed . Active tourist centres have grown up around many mineral water sites since ancient times , such as Hungary , Hisarya ( Bulgaria ) , Vichy ( France ) , Jermuk ( Armenia ) , Yessentuki ( Russia ) , Spa ( Belgium ) , Krynica-Zdr Ã j ( Poland ) , Sulphur Baths ( Tbilisi , Republic of Georgia ) , Bath ( England ) or Borsec ( Romania ) . Tourist development resulted in spa towns and hydropathic hotels ( often shortened to `` hydros '' ) . In modern times , it is far more common for mineral waters to be bottled at source for distributed consumption . Travelling to the mineral water site for direct access to the water is now uncommon , and in many cases not possible ( because of exclusive commercial ownership rights ) . There are more than 3,000 brands of mineral water commercially available worldwide . The more calcium plus magnesium ions are dissolved in water , the harder it is said to be ; water with few dissolved calcium plus magnesium ions is described as being soft . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration classifies mineral water as water containing at least 250 parts per million total dissolved solids ( TDS ) , originating from a geologically and physically protected underground water source . No minerals may be added to this water . However , in many places , the term `` mineral water '' is colloquially used to mean any bottled carbonated water or soda water , as opposed to tap water .

The Mulde is a river in Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt , Germany . It is a left tributary of the Elbe and 124 km in length . The river is formed by the confluence , near Colditz , of the Zwickauer Mulde ( running through Zwickau ) and the Freiberger Mulde ( with Freiberg on its banks ) , both rising from the Ore Mountains . From here the river runs northwards through Saxony ( Grimma , Wurzen , Eilenburg , Bad DÃ 1\/4 ben ) and Saxony-Anhalt ( JeÃ nitz and Dessau , the old capital of Anhalt ) . The Mulde flows in to the Elbe 3 km north of Dessau . In August 2002 a flood caused severe damage , that even endangered the UNESCO World Heritage Site `` Dessau-W Ã rlitzer Gartenreich '' and the city Dessau . Especially the cities of DÃ beln and Grimma suffered from the damages of the flood . Its name could be derived from Old German ( possibly Gothic ) `` Mulda '' ( ð 1\/4 á cents ð '' á á ) , meaning `` dust '' and a cognate of English `` mould '' ) . But more possibly it is related to the German `` mahlen '' which means `` to mill '' . Therefore , Mulde probably means `` the milling river '' and corresponds to the great number of water mills driven by the river in former times . Nowadays , there are hydroelectric power stations in use .
Cascais is near Estoril , where Alekhine died . Smoke grenades are canister-type grenades used as ground-to-ground or ground-to-air signaling devices , target or landing zone marking devices , or as screening devices for unit movements . Smoke grenades are normally considered non-lethal , although incorrect use may cause death . The body consists of a sheet steel cylinder with a four emission holes on top and one on the bottom to allow smoke release when the grenade is ignited . The filler consists of 250 to 350 grams of colored ( red , green , orange , gray , yellow , blue , white , black , or violet ) smoke composition ( mostly potassium chlorate , lactose , and a dye ) . The reaction is exothermic and grenade casings will often remain scalding hot for some time even after the grenade is no longer emitting smoke . Another type of smoke grenades are the bursting kind . These are filled with white phosphorus ( WP ) , which is spread by explosive action . White phosphorus catches fire in the presence of air , and burns with a brilliant yellow flame , while producing copious amounts of white smoke ( phosphorus pentoxide ) . These double as incendiary grenades , and a variant of these are also launched from infantry-portable or armored fighting vehicle-mounted grenade launchers . Users must also be wary of wind direction when using smoke grenades . Smoke grenades should not be confused with smoke bombs , which are typically started with an external fuse rather than a pin . Smoke grenades often cost around $ 40 USD compared to smoke bombs , which can often cost just a few cents . Smoke grenades generally emit a far larger amount of smoke than smoke bombs that are sold as fireworks . Used to create smoke screens , the grenades can be used to provide opportunity for movement over ground covered by fire . Smoke grenades can also be used to signal aircraft . Thermal imaging is able to ` see ' through smoke screens and , as such , fighting vehicles equipped with thermal imaging can use smoke to blind the enemy infantry while still being able to see them using thermal cameras . Smoke grenades are sometimes used in paintball or airsoft events , though these are not necessarily of military grade . Some devices utilized for the purpose of generating concealing smoke are high-volume smoke candles . Smoke grenades used in paintball and airsoft are typically `` cool burning '' smoke grenades . `` Cool '' or `` cold '' burning is an industry term indicating that the smoke grenade burns at a cooler temperature than military canister style smoke grenades . Additionally , a cool burning smoke grenade does not emit flame or sparks upon ignition or throughout the burn cycle .

Polygyros ( Greek : Î Î Î '' Ï Î Ï Ï Î Ï ) is a town and municipality in Central Macedonia , Greece . It is the capital of Chalkidiki . Polygyros town ( pop . 5,040 at the 2001 census ) is built in the shape of an amphitheatre on a plateau on the south west side of the mountain Cholomontas . It is south of Greek National Road 16 ( Thessaloniki - Arnaia ) . Polygyros is located SE of Thessaloniki , NE of Nea Moudania , NW of Sithonia and SW of Arnaia . The municipal unit ( the municipality before 2011 ) has a population of 10,721 inhabitants and a land area of 470.933 kmÂ . Other large villages in the municipal unit are KalÃ 1\/2 vai PolygÃ 1\/2 rou ( 1,136 ) , Ã `` lynthos ( 1,131 ) , TaxiÃ rchis ( 1,070 ) , and VrÃ stama ( 793 ) . There are different speculations about the origin of Polygyros ' name . Some claim that it comes from the combination of poly ( much ) and geros ( strong ) , because of the healthy climate . Others believe that the words poly and ieros ( sacred ) have given the present name , because of an ancient temple in the area . Also an old landowner , named Polyaros , offers a possible etymology . According to another possible etymology , the name derives from poly and gyros ( round ) , possible due to the town 's amphitheatric position . Some situate in the broader area of modern Polygyros the ancient city of Apollonia . Apollonia was one of the 32 cities , which , under the leadership of the Olynthus , constituted the Koinon ton Chalkideon ( Chalkidian League ) . The Koinon was destroyed in 379 BCE by the Spartans , while in 348 BCE Philipp II of Macedon annexed the whole Chalcidice into the Macedonian Kingdom . In 168 BCE Chalcidice was subjected by the Romans . The town of Polygyros is first mentioned in a medieval imperial document , chryssovoulon ( with golden stamp ) , of Eastern Roman Emperor Nikephoros III Botaneiates about 1080 CE . In 1430 , as the rest of the Eastern Roman Empire , Polygyros was conquered by the Ottomans and belonged to the Sanjak of Thessaloniki . On 17 May 1821 the people of Polygyros rose against the Ottoman authority and managed , temporarily , to expel the ottoman guard . Many residents of Polygyros took part in the 1854 's unsuccessful revolutionary movement against the Ottomans . Finally , on November 2 1912 the Greek army , as one of the winners of the First Balkan War , entered Polygyros and incorporated the town in the Greek State . Polygyros is famous for its carnival celebrations , which attracts visitors from all over Greece . A nearby location called Panagia ( Virgin Mary ) is the setting of a famous religious celebration on August 15 . Also , cultural societies are active in the fields of folk music and dance . Classic and modern music is cultivated in the municipal conservatory . Niki ( victory ) is the name of Polygyros ' football club , which participates in the Greek National Fourth Division Professional League . AOP ( Athletic Club of Polygyros ) is the local basketball team , participant in the Third National Basketball Division . The Archaeological Museum of Polygyros has exhibits containing findings from all over Halkidiki and referring to paleolithical and neolithical age , geometric , archaic , classic , hellenistic and Roman period .
Sandro Cois ( born 9 June 1972 in Fossano ) is a retired Italian football player . He has enjoyed a long career playing primarily as a defensive midfielder . He played for several clubs , including Torino and Piacenza . He is perhaps best known for his spell at Fiorentina in the mid-late 90s where he won over the fans with his tireless running and tenacious play , becoming important to the side as the less glamorous foil to playmakers like Rui Costa and Domenico Morfeo . It was during this period that he broke into the Italy national football team and was a participant at the 1998 FIFA World Cup , although he never became a regular in the side , winning just 2 caps . ; Torino F.C.
Calvi is a commune in the Haute-Corse department of France on the island of Corsica . It is the seat of the Canton of Calvi , which contains Calvi and one other commune , Lumio . Calvi is also the capital of the Arrondissement of Calvi , which contains , besides the Canton of Calvi , three other cantons : L' Ã le-Rousse , BelgodÃ re , and Calenzana . The 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment ( 2 Ã me REP ) of the French Foreign Legion is based in the citadel of Calvi . According to legend , Christopher Columbus supposedly came from Calvi , which at the time was part of the Genoese Empire . Because the often subversive elements of the island gave its inhabitants a bad reputation , he would have been expected to mask his exact birthplace . Calvi is located on the northwest coast of the island of Corsica , 95 k from Bastia and 24 k from L' Ã le-Rousse . It is the fifth-largest commune in Corsica ; however , the arrondissement is the smallest . Calvi is a subprefecture of the Haute-Corse . The motto , `` Calvi semper fidelis , '' ( `` Calvi Always Faithful '' ) referred originally to its loyaly to the Republic of Genoa . During the war with Revolutionary France , British forces under Admiral Nelson and Lieutenant-General Charles Stuart captured the city in the Siege of Calvi . It was during the bombardment of Calvi that Nelson sustained the injury that cost him his eye . The economy of Calvi is essentially based on summer tourism , which started in 1950 due to the pioneering efforts of Vladimir Raitz . Calvi is served by the international Calvi - Sainte-Catherine Airport , the Xavier Colonna Port , and a railway line to L' Ã le-Rousse and Ponte-Leccia , where it connects with the main line Ajaccio - Bastia .

The Meliaceae , or the Mahogany family , is a flowering plant family of mostly trees and shrubs ( and a few herbaceous plants , mangroves ) in the order Sapindales . They are characterised by alternate , usually pinnate leaves without stipules , and by syncarpous , apparently bisexual ( but actually mostly cryptically unisexual ) flowers borne in panicles , cymes , spikes , or clusters . Most species are evergreen , but some are deciduous , either in the dry season or in winter . The family includes about 50 genera and 550 species , with a pantropical distribution ; one genus ( Toona ) extends north into temperate China and south into southeast Australia , and another ( Melia ) nearly as far north . Various species are used for vegetable oil , soap-making , insecticides , and highly prized wood ( mahogany ) .

The Networker is a family of trains which operate on the UK railway system . They were built in the late 1980s and early 1990s by BREL ( which became part of ABB in the 1990s ) . The trains were built for the Network SouthEast sector of British Rail . They are all multiple unit trains . The Networker design was to become effectively the third generation of British Rail multiple units , and was originally intended to become one of the largest families of trains , bigger even than the largely Mark 3 based Second Generation , and was supposed to cover all the requirements for all future NSE multiple units but , the poor state of the economy in the early 1990s and privatisation prevented this from happening . Subsequently Bombardier Transportation has used the Networker as the basis for their successful post-privatisation Turbostar and Electrostar units ; having obtained the design through their acquisition of ADtranz which had absorbed ABB . The Turbos were built as a result of electrification not being possible on the lines out of the London terminals , Marylebone and Paddington . Since the privatisation of British Rail , many of the new train operating companies have purchased Turbostar trains from Bombardier Transportation ( formerly ADtranz ) , which are derived from the Networker-turbo design . The Class 165 is a 2 and 3 car Diesel multiple unit ( DMU ) , built for outer suburban workings . Upon privatisation , Chiltern Railways and Thames Trains operated the class . Chiltern Trains still uses the class , whilst Thames Trains have been replaced by First Great Western Link , and in turn First Great Western . The Class 165\/0 batch are one of the few units in Britain to have ATP installed . 76 units of the class were built between 1990 and 1992 . The Class 166 is a 3 car Diesel multiple unit ( DMU ) , built for mainline workings . This class is also related to the Turbo family of trains . Used by Network SouthEast , upon privatisation Thames Trains ( replaced by First Great Western Link , now First Great Western ) . 21 units of the class were built between 1992 and 1993 . These were actually a single four car EMU that was used as a research prototype . Class 457 was assigned for the tests using third rail DC traction , following which it was converted to test AC OHLE traction and renumbered as Class 316 . The Class 365 is a 4 car Electric Multiple Unit ( EMU ) . Although capable of dual voltage operation they have only ever been used in single voltage mode . They were initially supplied with only pick up shoes for use with 750V DC via third rail to Network SouthEast , which became Connex South Eastern upon privatisation , and then South Eastern Trains when the franchise changed . They were then transferred to WAGN ( now First Capital Connect ) where the shoe gear was removed and a Brecknell Willis pantograph was fitted for use with 25kv AC overhead line equipment . 41 units of the class were built between 1994 and 1995 . The Class 465 is a 4 car Electric Multiple Unit ( EMU ) . It is powered from 750V DC third rail . Built by both GEC Alsthom 465\/2s and BREL , ABB 465\/0 and 465\/1s in slightly different versions and are known as Metro units . Later some of the GEC Alsthom units received an internal overhaul and a first class section was added these units . They were numbered 465201-465234 and are now numbered 465901-465934 and are known as Weald units . Used by Network SouthEast , then Connex South Eastern upon privatisation , succeeded by South Eastern Trains and currently Southeastern . The Class 466 is a 2 car Electric Multiple Unit ( EMU ) . It is powered from 750V DC third rail and used extensively in multiple with 4 car 465s to form 6 car and 10 car formations . They were built by GEC Alsthom ( who built the 465\/2s ) and powered by GEC traction . The 466s are numbered 466001-466043 . The arrival of new electrostar ( class 376\/0 ) stock has seen some units move to rural lines to operate 2 car shuttles , displacing half the Class 508s . Used by Network SouthEast , then Connex South Eastern upon privatisation , succeeded by South Eastern Trains and currently Southeastern . 43 units of the class were built between 1993 and 1994 . Class 341 and 342 were two EMU types that were proposed but never built . Class 341 was intended to be the rolling stock for Crossrail prior to its cancellation in the early 1990s . The specifications for Class 341 have been utilised in drawing up the rolling stock specifications for the current incarnation of Crossrail . Class 342 was intended for use in the provision of domestic services on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link when it opened in 1994 . In the end these services were abandoned , and no trains were constructed Class 371 , 381 and 471 were three further EMU types intended as part of the Networker series . Classes 371 and 381 were proposed as the `` Universal Networker '' , a dual voltage train type for a multitude of various services including Kent Coast , Great Northern , Thameslink and LTS routes . Class 471 was the proposed `` main line Networker '' intended for long distance services from London to Kent and Sussex .
Tostock is a small village around eight miles east of Bury St. Edmunds in the county of Suffolk . It is a very traditional Suffolk village , with a good example of a fourteenth century church . The village is host to around 176 houses , with approximately 414 residents in total . The village 's houses are primarily located around two greens , The Green , forming the center of the village and The Leys , to the south side of the village and home to the village pond . The Parish Church of St. Andrew is Grade 1 listed . There was a church in Tostock mentioned in the Domesday survey of 1086 but the present building is believed to date from the 12th century . The tower was constructed in stages from about 1350 . It is believed that the tower was completed in the 1460s as the oldest of its four bells dates from that time . The Gardener 's Arms public house stands next to the village green alongside the chestnut tree that was planted in 1935 to commemorate the silver jubilee of King George V. Tostock 's Victorian school building was opened in 1874 and closed in 1945 . Today , most children attend either Norton Primary School or Woolpit Primary School , Beyton Middle School and Thurston Community College .
Segura ( , ; Latin : Thader , Arabic : War-Alabiat ) is a medium-sized river in southeastern Spain . It starts at Santiago Pontones ( province of JaÃ n ) , passes Calasparra , Cieza , Murcia , BeniajÃ n , Orihuela , Rojales and ends in the Mediterranean Sea near Guardamar del Segura in the province of Alicante . Some of its tributaries are the Mundo ( which starts near RiÃ par ) , the AlhÃ rabe ( which starts in Moratalla ) , the Mula and the GuadalentÃ n. The Segura is usually in a state of semi-permanent drought , however , now and then , it does occasionally flood as the consequence of the torrential rains which typically take place once every 6 â `` 9 years approximately , always in Autumn . In the twentieth century significant flooding occurred in 1946 , 1948 , 1973 , 1982 , 1987 and 1989 . Since 1990 the lower reaches of the river have been canalized , removing meanders and hence improving the evacuation of flood waters . The new canal was put to the test in September 1997 and October 2000 when heavy rainfall resulted in significant runoff . The alluvial plain is called the Vega del Segura and is a very productive agricultural region growing a wide variety of fruit , vegetables and flowers . The Vegas are divided into three areas : Alta , Media and Baja ( upper , medium , and lower ) . The Segura is one of the most polluted rivers in Europe . However , in recent years extensive water management techniques and the implementation of waste water treatment plants have greatly improved the situation . What must be considered is that the mean discharge is around 2 to 3 mÂ \/ s in Murcia city making it very difficult to dilute illegal pollutants .
Superparamagnetism is a form of magnetism , which appears in small ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic nanoparticles . In sufficiently small nanoparticles , magnetization can randomly flip direction under the influence of temperature . The typical time between two flips is called the NÃ el relaxation time . In the absence of external magnetic field , when the time used to measure the magnetization of the nanoparticles is much longer than the NÃ el relaxation time , their magnetization appears to be in average zero : they are said to be in the superparamagnetic state . In this state , an external magnetic field is able to magnetize the nanoparticles , similarly to a paramagnet . However , their magnetic susceptibility is much larger than the one of paramagnets . Normally , any ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material undergoes a transition to a paramagnetic state above its Curie temperature . Superparamagnetism is different from this standard transition since it occurs below the Curie temperature of the material . Superparamagnetism occurs in nanoparticles which are single-domain , i.e. composed of a single magnetic domain . This is possible when their diameter is below 3 â `` 50 nm , depending on the materials . In this condition , it is considered that the magnetization of the nanoparticles is a single giant magnetic moment , sum of all the individual magnetic moments carried by the atoms of the nanoparticle . This is what people working in the field of superparamagnetism call the â macro-spin approximationâ . Because of the nanoparticleâ s magnetic anisotropy , the magnetic moment has usually only two stable orientations antiparallel to each other , separated by an energy barrier . The stable orientations define the nanoparticleâ s so called â easy axisâ . At finite temperature , there is a finite probability for the magnetization to flip and reverse its direction . The mean time between two flips is called the NÃ el relaxation time and is given by the following NÃ el-Arrhenius equation : This length of time can be anywhere from a few nanoseconds to years or much longer . In particular , it can be seen that the NÃ el relaxation time is an exponential function of the grain volume , which explains why the flipping probability becomes rapidly negligible for bulk materials or large nanoparticles . Let us imagine that the magnetization of a single superparamagnetic nanoparticle is measured and let us define as the measurement time . If , the nanoparticle magnetization will flip several times during the measurement , then the measured magnetization will average to zero . If , the magnetization will not flip during the measurement , so the measured magnetization will be what the instantaneous magnetization was at the beginning of the measurement . In the former case , the nanoparticle will appear to be in the superparamagnetic state whereas in the latter case it will appear to be â blockedâ in its initial state . The state of the nanoparticle ( superparamagnetic or blocked ) depends on the measurement time . A transition between superparamagnetism and blocked state occurs when . In several experiments , the measurement time is kept constant but the temperature is varied , so the transition between superparamagnetism and blocked state is seen as a function of the temperature . The temperature for which is called the blocking temperature : For typical laboratory measurements , the value of the logarithm in the previous equation is in the order of 20 â `` 25 . When an external magnetic field is applied to an assembly of superparamagnetic nanoparticles , their magnetic moments tend to align along the applied field , leading to a net magnetization . The magnetization curve of the assembly , i.e. the magnetization as a function of the applied field , is a reversible S-shaped increasing function . This function is quite complicated but for some simple cases : in the first case in the second case . The later susceptibility is also valid for all temperatures if the easy axes of the nanoparticles are randomly oriented . It can be seen from these equations that large nanoparticles have a larger Â and so a larger susceptibility . This explains why superparamagnetic nanoparticles have a much larger susceptibility than standard paramagnets : they behave exactly as a paramagnet with a huge magnetic moment . There is no time-dependence of the magnetization when the nanoparticles are either completely blocked or completely superparamagnetic . There is , however , a narrow window around where the measurement time and the relaxation time have comparable magnitude . In this case , a frequency-dependence of the susceptibility can be observed . For a randomly-oriented sample , the complex susceptibility is : A superparamagnetic system can be measured with AC susceptibility measurements , where an applied magnetic field varies in time , and the magnetic response of the system is measured . A superparamagnetic system will show a characteristic frequency dependence : When the frequency is much higher than 1 \/ Ï N , there will be a different magnetic response than when the frequency is much lower than 1 \/ Ï N , since in the latter case , but not the former , the ferromagnetic clusters will have time to respond to the field by flipping their magnetization . The precise dependence can be calculated from the NÃ el-Arrhenius equation , assuming that the neighboring clusters behave independently of one another ( if clusters interact , their behavior becomes more complicated ) . Superparamagnetism sets a limit on the storage density of hard disk drives due to the minimum size of particles that can be used . This limit is known as the superparamagnetic limit .
The Universal Media Disc ( UMD ) is an optical disc medium developed by Sony for use on the PlayStation Portable . It can hold up to 1.8 gigabytes of data . ECMA-365 : Data Interchange on 60 mm Read-Only ODC â `` Capacity : 1.8 GB ( UMD ) DVD region coding has been applied to most UMD movies and music . On the other hand regional lockout is not applied to games , making them region free . The primary application for UMD discs is as a storage medium for PSP games , although the format is also used for the storage of motion pictures and , to a lesser degree , television shows for playback on the PSP . The video is encoded in the H. 264\/MPEG -4 AVC format , with the audio in ATRAC3plus . The BBC released a number of its TV titles on UMD in the UK , including The Office , The Mighty Boosh , Doctor Who and Little Britain . Some adult films have been released on UMD in Japan . Although it was implied that UMD piracy was impossible due to the proprietary nature of the discs , a combination of software security flaws in early PlayStation Portable firmware builds made it possible to extract images of a disc in the standard ISO 9660 format . Sony had always included methods for loading game images from other storage mediums , as a means of future proofing the system . This has been exploited to allow full retail UMD images to be run , making piracy possible with no hardware modifications . The UMD discs offer large capacity and the capability to store quality audio\/video content ; however , the format 's proprietary nature and the lack of writers and blank media has made adoption difficult . In comparison to Sony 's MiniDisc format , there are a number of features lacking ; the sliding shield which prevents direct disc contact on MiniDiscs is absent from all UMDs released to date , though it is an option according to the ECMA specification . According to the official ECMA specification Sony designed the UMD to support two possible future enhancements and products . 1 . Protective Shutter : Similar to the MiniDisc and 3 Â 1\/2 '' floppy disc , this protective shutter will shield the inner disc from accidental contact . 2 . Auto-Loading : UMDs were designed for possible future slot loading devices with Auto-Loading mechanisms . These would be very similar to the auto-loading mechanism used in slot loading MiniDisc home and car decks . It would also be similar to the VHS U-Matic auto-loading mechanism . Unlike the current clamshell loading design the PSP uses , a slot loading device using an Auto-Loading mechanism would be motorized and completely automatic . The user would insert the disc into the device slot , the motorized mechanism would then take over and draw the disc inside the drive completing the loading process . The disc would also be ejected fully automatically by the motorized mechanism , like a VCR . This would also mean that power would be required in order to insert or eject a disc . The UMD format never saw implementation on any device other than the PlayStation Portable . As a result , the market is very limited compared to those for other optical media formats . Although poor sales early in the format 's life had caused major studios Universal and Paramount to rescind their support ( and even Sony had announced they would cease UMD video production ) , Sony , Columbia , and other film publishers continue to distribute their films on UMD . Capcom , HBO , Disney and various other content producers have also continued their support of the format , releasing TV shows , cartoons and OVAs on UMD as well . Retail support of the film experienced similar troubles , with speculation in 2006 that Wal-Mart would soon be pulling UMD videos from their stores completely . In August 2007 , Multimedia Recovery brought to the market their UMD Replacement Case after many complaints from PlayStation Portable owners that the outer casing of the UMD disc was cracking or pulling apart due to the poor design . This causes the UMD to become unreadable in the PlayStation Portable . In late 2009 , Sony began pushing developers away from the UMD format and towards digital distribution on the PlayStation Network in preparation for the launch of the digital-download-only PSP Go , which is the first PSP model to not include a UMD drive . However , the new system has experienced lackluster sales compared to previous models , with most consumers still choosing the UMD-compatible PSP-3000 model , which continues to be sold along side the PSP Go . And despite the earlier push for PlayStation Network releases around the PSP Go 's launch , over half of the PSP 's library is still only available in UMD format , though there have been a few PlayStation Network-only releases since the PSP Go 's launch , such as LocoRoco Midnight Carnival . Still , most new games continue to be distributed via UMD , and , aside from those published by SCE , not all have been released on PlayStation Network . The successor of the PlayStation Portable , tentatively known as the Next Generation Portable , was announced to introduce the use of a new type of media for its software , Hence , UMD is expected to be abandoned for use on future systems .
Real Sociedad de FÃ tbol , S.A.D. ( more commonly referred to as Real Sociedad ) is a Basque football club based in the city of San SebastiÃ n , founded on 7 September 1909 . Their home stadium is Anoeta , which seats 32,200 spectators . The club is known in Basque as Erreala or the txuri-urdin ( meaning `` white-blue '' in Basque ) , from their colors : blue with white vertical stripes and white shorts . The club name means Royal Society of Football . A blue quarter on white also appears in the flag of their home town . Football was introduced to San SebastiÃ n in the early 1900s by students and workers returning from Britain . In 1904 they formed the San Sebastian Recreation Club and in 1905 they competed in the Copa del Rey . In May 1905 the San Sebastian Football Club was formed as a separate branch of the club . In 1909 they applied to enter the Copa del Rey but complications over registration permits saw them compete as Club Ciclista de San Sebastian . This team beat Club EspaÃ ol de Madrid 3 â `` 1 in the final . Out of the confusion the Sociedad de Futbol was formed on 7 September 1909 . In 1910 Spanish clubs played in two rival cup competitions and Sociedad de Futbol entered the Copa UECF as Vasconia de San Sebastian . In the same year the King Alfonso XIII , who used San SebastiÃ n as his summer capital , gave the club his patronage . They subsequently became known as Real Sociedad de FÃ tbol . Real Sociedad were founder members of La Liga in 1928 . The team came fourth with Francisco `` Paco '' Bienzobas finishing as top scorer . The team 's name was changed to Donostia Club de Futbol in 1931 , with the advent of the Second Spanish Republic , but changed back to Real Sociedad after the Spanish Civil War in 1939 . The team has generally fluctuated between the Primera and Segunda divisions , in one period ( during the 1940s ) managing to be relegated and promoted seven times . Around that time the sculptor Eduardo Chillida was the team 's goalkeeper until injury put a stop to his football career . The best period of the team 's history must be the early 1980s where they won the Primera two seasons running . For many years , Real Sociedad followed the practice of their Basque rivals Athletic Bilbao of signing only Basque players . They abandoned the policy in 1989 when they signed Irish international John Aldridge from Liverpool . Real Sociedad 's best league performance in recent years is their 2nd place finish in La Liga in 2002 â `` 03 . Key contributors to that side included a Serb ( Darko KovaÄ eviÄ ) , two Turks ( Nihat Kahveci and Tayfun Korkut ) , a Russian ( Valeri Karpin ) , a Dutch goalkeeper ( Sander Westerveld ) , and Spanish home-grown talent Xabi Alonso , coached by French manager Raynald Denoueix . Key moments from that season came when Real Sociedad beat Real Madrid in April 4 â `` 2 at the Anoeta in San SebastiÃ n. They kept first place in La Liga until matchday 37 when they were due to play Celta de Vigo in a match that ended up 3 â `` 2 in favor of Celta , while on the other hand Real Madrid had beaten city rivals Atletico Madrid 4 â `` 0 . This meant that the team from Madrid secured first place two points clear of Real Sociedad just ahead of the last matchday of the season when a 3 â `` 0 Sociedad victory against Atletico Madrid was just not enough because Real Madrid had just secured another victory against Athletic Bilbao . The team qualified directly for the UEFA Champions League 2003 â `` 04 by finishing 2nd , they ended up unbeaten at home with 71 goals scored and defeated on 6 occasions only . Strikers Nihat and KovaÄ eviÄ finished 2nd and 3rd respectively on the Pichichi chart with 23 and 20 goals . While Real Sociedad still attempt to keep a core of Basque players , whether coming from their own teams or signed from other clubs , they also employ non-Basque Spanish players , as well as foreigners . They were relegated from La Liga in 2006 â `` 07 , finishing 19th . On 9 July 2007 , former Welsh international and Fulham manager Chris Coleman was appointed as the new club coach , on the recommendation of former Real Sociedad manager John Toshack , who remains a respected and influential figure at the club . Coleman resigned on 16 January 2008 . On 13 June 2010 , Real Sociedad returned to La Liga . The numbers are established according to the official website : www.realsociedad.com and www.lfp.es . The EU flags indicate players who , although foreign , are still members of the European Economic Community , thus the club is not restricted in playing such foreigners .
In mathematics , a lemma ( plural lemmata or lemmas from the Greek Î '' Î Î 1\/4 Î 1\/4 Î , `` lemma '' meaning `` anything which is received , such as a gift , profit , or a bribe '' ) is a proven proposition which is used as a stepping stone to a larger result rather than as a statement in-and-of itself . A good stepping stone leads to many others , so some of the most powerful results in mathematics are known as lemmata , such as BÃ zout 's lemma , Urysohn 's lemma , Dehn 's lemma , Fatou 's lemma , Gauss 's lemma , Nakayama 's lemma , PoincarÃ 's lemma , Riesz 's lemma , Schwarz 's lemma , ItÅ 's lemma and Zorn 's lemma . There is no formal distinction between a lemma and a theorem , only one of usage and convention .
The orbital speed of a body , generally a planet , a natural satellite , an artificial satellite , or a multiple star , is the speed at which it orbits around the barycenter of a system , usually around a more massive body . It can be used to refer to either the mean orbital speed , the average speed as it completes an orbit , or instantaneous orbital speed , the speed at a particular point in its orbit . The orbital speed at any position in the orbit can be computed from the distance to the central body at that position , and the specific orbital energy , which is independent of position : the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the potential energy . The transverse orbital speed is inversely proportional to the distance to the central body because of the law of conservation of angular momentum , or equivalently , Kepler 's second law . This states that as a body moves around its orbit during a fixed amount of time , the line from the barycenter to the body sweeps a constant area of the orbital plane , regardless of which part of its orbit the body traces during that period of time . This means that the body moves faster near its periapsis than near its apoapsis , because at the smaller distance it needs to trace a greater arc to cover the same area . This law is usually stated as `` equal areas in equal time . '' For orbits with small eccentricity , the length of the orbit is close to that of a circular one , and the mean orbital speed can be approximated either from observations of the orbital period and the semimajor axis of its orbit , or from knowledge of the masses of the two bodies and the semimajor axis . where is the orbital velocity , is the length of the semimajor axis , is the orbital period , and is the standard gravitational parameter . Note that this is only an approximation that holds true when the orbiting body is of considerably lesser mass than the central one , and eccentricity is close to zero . where is now the mass of the body under consideration , is the mass of the body being orbited , is specifically the distance between the two bodies ( which is the sum of the distances from each to the center of mass ) , and is the gravitational constant . This is still a simplified version ; it does n't allow for elliptical orbits , but it does at least allow for bodies of similar masses . Where M is the ( greater ) mass around which this negligible mass or body is orbiting , and ve is the escape velocity . For an object in an eccentric orbit orbiting a much larger body , the length of the orbit decreases with eccentricity , and is given at ellipse . The mean orbital speed decreases with eccentricity .
In cryptography , MacGuffin is a block cipher created in 1994 by Bruce Schneier and Matt Blaze at a Fast Software Encryption workshop . It was intended as a catalyst for analysis of a new cipher structure , known as Generalized Unbalanced Feistel Networks ( GUFNs ) . The cryptanalysis proceeded very quickly , so quickly that the cipher was broken at the same workshop by Vincent Rijmen and Bart Preneel . Schneier and Blaze based MacGuffin on DES , their main change being that the data block is not split into equal halves in the Feistel network . Instead , 48 bits of the 64-bit data block are fed through the round function , whose output is XORed with the other 16 bits of the data block . The algorithm was experimental , intended to explore the security properties of unbalanced Feistel networks . The diagram to the right shows one round of MacGuffin . The 64-bit data block is broken into four 16-bit words ( each represented by one line ) . The rightmost three are XORed with subkey bits derived from the secret key . They are then fed through eight S-boxes , each of which takes six bits of input and produces two bits of output . The output ( a total of 16 bits ) is then recombined and XORed with the leftmost word of the data block . The new leftmost block is then rotated into the rightmost position of the resulting data block . The algorithm then continues with more rounds . MacGuffin 's key schedule is a modified version of the encryption algorithm itself . Since MacGuffin is a Feistel network , decryption is easy ; simply run the encryption algorithm in reverse . Schneier and Blaze recommended using 32 rounds , and specified MacGuffin with a 128-bit key . At the same workshop where MacGuffin was introduced , Rijmen and Preneel showed that it was vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis . They showed that 32 rounds of MacGuffin is weaker than 16 rounds of DES , since it took `` a few hours '' to get good differential characteristics for DES with good starting values , and the same time to get good differential characteristics for MacGuffin with no starting values . They found that it is possible to get the last round key with differential cryptanalysis , and from that reverse the last round and repeat the attack for the rest of the rounds . Rijmen and Preneel tried attacking MacGuffin with different S-boxes , taken directly from DES . This version proved to be slightly stronger , but they warn that designing an algorithm to resist only known attacks is generally not a good design principle .
It is a part of North Kosovo , a region with an ethnic Serb majority that functions largely autonomously from the remainder of the ethnic-Albanian-majority Kosovo . The municipality covers an area of 104 k , and consists of 35 villages . As of 2008 , the municipality has a population of approximately 17,000 . In November 2005 , it was estimated that the municipality was 95 % Serb , with only 4 Albanian families in the area . According to 2006 estimates , the municipality of ZveÄ an had a population of 16,600 people . As of 2008 , the municipality has a population of approximately 17,000 inhabitants , of which ca . 16,050 ( ca . 94 % ) are Serbs . Some 350 Albanians are concentrated in the villages of Boljetin , Lipa and Å 1\/2 aÅ 3\/4 a , with 80 Kosovo Albanian families having returned to the municipality since 2000 . A small number of other minorities also reside in the munnicipality . About 4,000 Kosovo Serbs are located in the municipality as Internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) as well as 250 refugees from Croatia . The town of ZveÄ an is located near Kosovska Mitrovica . It was mentioned for the first time in connection with the border clashes between the Serbs and Byzantines between 1091 and 1094 . There is also an inscription that Stephen Nemanja , after the victory over the Byzantines in 1170 , ordered that a prayer for the successful outcome of the battle be held in the church of St. George at ZveÄ an . In the 13th and 14th centuries ZveÄ an was one of the royal residences of the Serbian court . Queen Theodora died there in December 1322 , and nine years later her husband , Stefan UroÅ III was imprisoned and strangled there . On the highest spot , i.e. the Upper Town , there are remains of the church of St. George , cistern and the main octagonal tower . The ramparts of this part of the fort are reinforced by massive towers . The main entrance to the town was on the western side . In 1389 , after the Battle of Kosovo , it was integrated into the Ottoman Empire and later became part of the Sanjak of Novi Pazar . From 1878 to 1908 it , along with the rest of the Sanjak , was administered by the Austro-Hungarian Empire as a result of the Congress of Berlin . But in 1908 it was returned to Turkey . The largest employer in ZveÄ an is the lead and zinc smelting factory â TrepÄ a. â Its large smokestack is with 306 metres the tallest structure in Kosbo . Due to the serious environmental pollution from the factory , however , UN and KFOR shut it down and the only ongoing operation is alloy production for batteries and battery recycling . Once employing up to 4,000 , the very low operations of â TrepÄ aâ has had a devastating effect on the local economy . Today , in the municipality only about 500 people are working at 60 small private companies and 150 shops . In ZveÄ an is situated the Faculty of Arts of Pristina , part of the University of Pristina at Kosovska Mitrovica . ZveÄ an has hosted annually two international music festivals : The North City Jazz & Blues Festival , and international rock festival Overdrive , as well as international art colony Sokolica and children song festival Cvrkuti sa Ibra ( Chirrups from the Ibar River ) . The ZveÄ an Fortress and Sokolica monastery , both from the Middle Ages , have been located in the ZveÄ an area . ZveÄ an is the hometown of famous Serbian tennis player Novak Ä okoviÄ .
Cape Fear is a prominent headland jutting into the Atlantic Ocean from Bald Head Island on the coast of North Carolina in the southeastern United States . It is largely formed of barrier beaches and the silty outwash of the Cape Fear River as it drains the southeast coast of North Carolina through an estuary south of Wilmington . Cape Fear is formed by the intersection of two sweeping arcs of shifting , low-lying beach , the result of longshore currents which also form the treacherous , shifting Frying Pan Shoals , part of the Graveyard of the Atlantic . Dunes dominated by sea oats occur from the upper beach driftline back to the stable secondary dunes , where they mix with other grasses such as Saltmeadow Cordgrass and panic grass , as well as seaside goldenrod , spurge , and other herbs to form a stable salt-tolerant grassland . The Cape Fear estuary drains the largest watershed in North Carolina , containing 27 % of the state 's population . Giovanni da Verrazzano , the Italian explorer sailing for France , made landfall after crossing the Atlantic at or near Cape Fear on March 1 , 1524 . The name comes from the 1585 expedition of Sir Richard Grenville . Sailing to Roanoke Island , his ship became embayed behind the cape . Some of the crew were afraid they would wreck , giving rise to the name Cape Fear . It is the fifth oldest surviving English place-name in the U.S. It was the landing place of General Sir Henry Clinton during the American Revolutionary War on May 3 , 1775 . The 1962 movie Cape Fear was set at Cape Fear .
Soignies is a Walloon municipality located in the Belgian province of Hainaut . The municipality is composed of the Town of Soignies together with the villages of Casteau , ChaussÃ e-Notre-Dame-Louvignies , Horrues , Neufvilles , Naast and Thieusies . Casteau is known worldwide because SHAPE , the military headquarters of NATO , has been based at the village since 1967 . The name of Soignies comes from the Latin word suniacum , which means `` on the Senne '' . The spring of the Senne is near Soignies . After Soignies , the river passes through Brussels . Soignies is also well known for its blue limestone ( from the CarriÃ res du Hainaut ) and its glass industry ( Durobor ) . The history of the region starts in the second half of the 7th century . In the 670s , Madelgaire , a wealthy former governor under King Dagobert I , and his wife Waltrude decided to separate and devote themselves to a religious life . Both of them founded an abbey , Madelgaire in Soignies and Waltrude in neighbouring Mons . Madelgaire took the religious name of Vincent . Like his wife , he was canonized after his death and later became the patron saint of the city that would eventually grow around the monastery . At that time , a large forest covered the whole area , the remnants of which near Brussels are still called the Sonian Forest ( French : ForÃ t de Soignes , Dutch : ZoniÃ `` nwoud ) today . The existence of the abbey of Soignies is mentioned for the first time in the Treaty of Meersen , dated August 8 , 870 , as one of King Charles the Bald 's possessions . At the end of the 9th century , a general decline in religious life led to a chapter of powerful canons -- who did not take any vow of poverty -- taking the place of the monks . These canons would remain in power for eight centuries , until the French Revolution . By the 10th century , the canons started the construction of the church of Saint Vincent ( Madelgaire ) , which was to be completed during the following century in the prevalent Romanesque style of the period . The first known charter by Baldwin IV , Count of Hainaut was granted to Soignies in 1142 . The fame of the church of Saint Vincent grew in the 13th century , when the bishop of Cambrai granted a 40-day indulgence to every visitor to the church . The city itself grew to urban proportions at around the same time , coinciding with the development of the textile industry and the building of a defensive wall . The first stone quarries mentioned in the archives date from around 1400 , but several clues lead to believe that local stone was already quarried much earlier . The cut-stone industry , however , started only around 1700 . On September 1 , 1796 , the revolutionary council disbanded the local administration by the canons , thereby also dealing a heavy blow to the local economy . In 1812 , only 92 people worked in the quarries on a total population of about 4,000 people . The industry , however , rebounded under the Dutch regime , and even more after the Belgian Revolution of 1830 . Today , the cut-stone and glass industries are still active . Soignies is also the center of a vibrant service industry , especially in education and health .

The Christian Community is a Christian denomination . It was founded in 1922 in Switzerland by a group of mainly Lutheran theologians and ministers led by Friedrich Rittelmeyer , inspired by Rudolf Steiner , the Austrian philosopher and founder of anthroposophy . Christian Community congregations exist as financially independent groups with regional and international administrative bodies overseeing their work . There are approximately 350 worldwide . The international headquarters are in Berlin , Germany . The Christian Community is led by the `` circle of priests , '' with leaders known as coordinators appointed within the circle . A first coordinator ( Erzoberlenker ) is consulted by two second coordinators ( Oberlenkers ) . There are also third coordinators ( Lenkers ) on the regional level and a synod of priests . There is no additional ordination for the leadership . The priesthood of the Christian Community has always been open to women . The Christian Community does not require its members to conform to any specific teaching or behavior . Seven sacraments are celebrated within the Community : the Eucharist , generally called the Act of Consecration of Man , and six other sacraments : Baptism , Confirmation , Marriage , The Last Anointing , Sacramental Consultation ( replacing Confession ) , and Ordination .
The 1936 Winter Olympics , officially known as the IV Olympic Winter Games , were a winter multi-sport event which was celebrated in 1936 in the market town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Bavaria , Germany . Germany also hosted the Summer Olympics the same year in Berlin . 1936 is the last year in which the Summer and Winter Games were both held in the same country ( the canceled 1940 games would have been held in Japan , with that country likewise hosting the Winter and Summer games ) . The 1936 Winter Olympics were organized on behalf of the Sports Office of the Third Reich ( DRL ) by Karl Ritter von Halt . Von Halt had been named President of the Committee for the organization of the Fourth Winter Olympics in Garmisch by ReichssportfÃ 1\/4 hrer Hans von Tschammer und Osten . Medals were awarded in 17 events in 6 sports ( 8 disciplines ) . 28 nations sent athletes to compete in Germany . Australia , Bulgaria , Greece , Liechtenstein , Spain , and Turkey all made their Winter Olympic debut in Garmisch-Partenkirchen , and Estonia , Latvia , the Netherlands , and Yugoslavia all returned to the Games after having missed the 1932 Winter Olympics .
Marlesford is a village and a civil parish in the Suffolk Coastal District , in the English county of Suffolk . It is about 2 miles away from the small town of Wickham Market . Marlesford has a place of worship and a pub . The area of the village that is on the A12 road ( where the pub is ) is due to be by-passed , the scheme will not be implemented until after 2016 . It once had a railway station called Marlesford railway station but it was closed in 1952 .
RÃ 1\/4 ppell 's Fox ( Vulpes rueppellii ) , also spelled Rueppell 's Fox and also called the Sand Fox , is a species of fox living in North Africa and the Middle East , from Morocco and the Sahel region to an Afghanistan hills . It is named after the German collector Eduard RÃ 1\/4 ppell . RÃ 1\/4 pell 's Fox is also called the Sand Fox , but this terminology is confusing because the Corsac Fox ( Vulpes corsac ) and the Tibetan Sand Fox ( Vulpes ferrilata ) are also known as the `` Sand Fox '' . It has an average life expectancy of up to 6 or 7 years in the wild , but can live much longer in captivity . RÃ 1\/4 ppell 's Fox is 40-52 centimeters ( 15.75-20 .5 inches ) long and has an average weight of 1.7 kilograms ( 3.75 lbs ) . It is a very small canine , and is considerably smaller than the Red Fox . It is sandy in color and has black patches on the muzzle , as well as a white tipped tail . RÃ 1\/4 ppell 's Fox has fur on the pads on its feet , that possibly helps distribute their weight and move easily on sand , and definitely keeps the hot sand from burning their feet . Similar to other desert dwelling foxes , RÃ 1\/4 ppell 's Fox has massive ears to cool it off . The tail is long and bushy . These features make RÃ 1\/4 ppell 's Fox look almost like a large Fennec Fox . RÃ 1\/4 ppell 's Fox relies on scent glands for many activities . It uses them to mark territories as well as to spray unwanted predators , similar to the behavior of the skunk . The female RÃ 1\/4 ppell 's Fox uses her scent glands to mark the cubbing den . Another use for the scent glands is that the foxes use them to greet each other . RÃ 1\/4 ppell 's Fox can bark , in a way similar to a dog . Around mating season , RÃ 1\/4 ppell 's Fox travels in monogamous groups , or a male and a female , but after breeding season , the fox reportedly moves in family groups of 3-15 individuals . One animal occupies about 50-69 square kilometers of territory , though the male 's territory is larger than that of the female 's . RÃ 1\/4 ppell 's Fox is nocturnal and gregarious . The animals change dens often , and will abandon a den if there is a dangerous disturbance in the area . Most dens are dug under rocks , or under trees . RÃ 1\/4 ppell 's Fox was pushed to living in the desert biome due to competition with its larger cousin , the Red Fox . It is known as being an extremely good survivor . RÃ 1\/4 ppell 's Fox 's only predators are the Steppe Eagle and the Eagle Owl . RÃ 1\/4 ppell 's Fox is a solitary forager . It is an omnivore , and will eat almost anything that crosses its path . Mostly , it is an insectivore , but its diet also consists of tubers and roots , as well as small mammals , reptiles , eggs , and arachnids . The female RÃ 1\/4 ppell 's Fox has a gestation period of around 51 â `` 53 days . She has 2-3 kits , and each are born blind . They are weaned at 6 â `` 8 weeks of age . They are born underground , to protect them from predators . For about 100 years , RÃ 1\/4 ppell 's Fox has been treated like a pest . RÃ 1\/4 ppell 's Fox preys on many livestock animals in Arabia , including chickens , lambs , and young goats . RÃ 1\/4 ppell 's Fox has no conservation status as of now , for it is too hard to estimate the actual numbers . As such , the IUCN lists them as Data Deficient . The Libyan Posts ( General Posts and Telecommunications Company , GPTC ) in cooperation with WWF ( World Wide Fund for Nature ) , dedicated a postal stamps issue to RÃ 1\/4 ppell 's Fox on May 1 , 2008 . The issue is made of a set of four stamps printed in minisheet of two sets . The issue was completed with a special First day of issue Cover having a special postmark .

Massa is a town and comune in Tuscany , central Italy , the administrative center of the province of Massa-Carrara . It is located in the Frigido River Valley , near the Alpi Apuane , some 5 kilometers from the Tyrrhenian Sea . The Massa area is of high touristic value and also hosts a concentration of some 600 industrial and craft activities , located within the so-called Apuan Industrial Zone , with a direct employment of more than 7,000 people . Together with the twin town of Carrara , Massa is worldwide known for the extraction and production of marble . From the 15th to the 19th century , Massa was the capital of the independent Principate ( later Duchy ) of Massa and Carrara , ruled by the Malaspina and Cybo-Malaspina families . Massa is the first recorded town in Europe in which the magnetic needle compass was used in mines to map them and determine the extent of various mine owners ' properties . In 1829 the city was handed over to the Austrian branch of the Este family . In 1859 , during the unification of Italy process , it joined the Kingdom of Sardinia .

This is a list of the 77 counties in the U.S. state of Oklahoma . Oklahoma is ranked 20th size and 17th in the number of counties , between Mississippi with 82 counties and Arkansas with 75 counties . Oklahoma originally had seven counties when it was first organized as the Oklahoma Territory . These counties were designated numerically , first through seventh . New counties added after this were designated by letters of the alphabet . The first seven counties were later renamed . The Oklahoma Constitutional Convention named all of the counties that were formed when Oklahoma entered statehood in 1907 . Only two counties have been formed since then . According to the Oklahoma Constitution , a county can be disorganized if the sum of all taxable property is less than two and half million dollars . If so , then a petition must be signed by one-fourth of the population and then a vote would occur . If a majority vote for dissolution of the county , the county will combined with an adjacent county with the lowest valuation of taxable property . The Federal Information Processing Standard ( FIPS ) code , which is used by the United States government to uniquely identify counties , is provided with each entry . The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county . The Area in these tables is land area , and does not include water area . Oklahoma 's postal abbreviation is OK and its FIPS state code is 40 .
In atmospheric sciences ( meteorology , climatology and related fields ) , the pressure gradient ( typically of air , more generally of any fluid ) is a physical quantity that describes in which direction and at what rate the pressure changes the most rapidly around a particular location . The pressure gradient is a dimensional quantity expressed in units of pressure per unit length . The SI unit is pascal per metre ( Pa\/m ) . Assuming that the pressure p is an intensive quantity , i.e. , a single-valued , continuous and differentiable function of three-dimensional space ( often called a scalar field ) , i.e. , that Strictly speaking , the concept of pressure gradient is a local characterization of the air ( more generally of the fluid under investigation ) . The pressure gradient is defined only at those spatial scales at which pressure ( more generally fluid dynamics ) itself is defined . Within planetary atmospheres ( including the Earth 's ) , the pressure gradient is a vector pointing roughly downwards , because the pressure changes most rapidly vertically , increasing downwards . The value of the strength ( or norm ) of the pressure gradient in the troposphere is typically of the order 9 Pa\/m ( or 90 hPa\/km ) . The pressure gradient often has a small but critical horizontal component , which is largely responsible for the wind circulation . The horizontal pressure gradient is a 2-dimensional vector resulting from the projection of the pressure gradient onto a local horizontal plane . Near the Earth 's surface , this horizontal pressure gradient is typically pointing towards high pressure air masses ( anticyclones ) , its particular orientation at any one time and place depends strongly on the weather situation . At mid-latitudes , the typical horizontal pressure gradient may take on values of the order of 10 â ' 2 Pa\/m ( or 10 Pa\/km ) , although rather higher values occur within meteorological fronts . Differences in air pressure between different locations are critical in weather forecasting and climate . As indicated above , the pressure gradient constitutes one of the main forces acting on the air to make it move as wind . Note that the pressure gradient force points from high towards low pressure zones , it is thus oriented in the opposite direction from the pressure gradient itself . Sound waves and shock waves are events that can induce very large pressure gradients , but these are often transitory disturbances .

With funding from donors , investment income and government grants , the hall ended the that season with $ 1.9 million more in total revenues than total costs . The hall 's employee who oversees props was paid $ 530,000 in salary and benefits during the fiscal year that ended in June 2008 . The four other members of the full-time stage crewâ '' two carpenters and two electriciansâ '' had an average income of $ 430,000 during that period . By comparison , the top highest paid non-union employees were the Artistic and Executive Director , Clive Gillinson , who was paid $ 946,000 in salary and benefits ; the Chief Financial Officer , at $ 352,000 , and the General Manager , at $ 341,000 . Wiener Musikverein , , commonly shortened to The Musikverein , has a twofold meaning : it is the name of a famous Vienna concert hall , as well as the short name for the music society , Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde ( Society of Music Friends ) , that owns the building . This building is located on DumbastraÃ e behind the Imperial Hotel , between BÃ sendorferstraÃ e and Karlsplatz . However , because BÃ sendorferstraÃ e is so small a street , the building is better known as being between Karlsplatz and KÃ rntner Ring ( part of RingstraÃ e loop ) . The back of the building faces Canovagasse ( Canova lane ) . The concert hall was built by the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde , on a piece of land given by Emperor Franz Joseph , and it was opened on January 6 , 1870 . A historic organ was installed in it by the Austrian firm Rieger , in 1907 . The Musikverein is famous for its acoustics and is considered to be one of the five finest concert\/opera venues in the world . None of these halls was built in the modern era with the application of acoustics science , and , with the partial exception of the horseshoe-shaped Colon , all share a long , tall , and narrow shape . It is the home to the Vienna Philharmonic .
Manganese ( II ) oxide is the inorganic compound with formula MnO . MnO is a basic oxide that is insoluble in water but dissolves in acids , forming manganese ( II ) salts . MnO can be prepared by the reduction of any higher oxide with hydrogen e.g. : MnCO3 â ' MnO + CO2 This calcining process is conducted anaerobically to prevent formation of Mn2O3 . MnO occurs in nature as the rare mineral manganosite . MnO has the NaCl , rock salt structure , where cations and anions are both octahedrally coordinated . The composition of MnO can vary from MnO to MnO1 .045 . Below 118 K MnO is antiferromagnetic . MnO has the distinction of being one of the first compounds to have its magnetic structure determined by neutron diffraction in 1951 . . This study showed that the Mn2 + ions form a face centered cubic magnetic sub-lattice where there are ferromagnetically coupled sheets which are anti-parallel with adjacent sheets . Together with manganese sulfate , MnO is a component of fertilizer and feed additives . Many thousands of tons are consumed annually for this purpose .

Anna 's Hummingbird ( Calypte anna ) is a medium-sized hummingbird native to the west coast of North America . This bird was named after Anna MassÃ na , Duchess of Rivoli . Anna 's Hummingbird is 3.9 to 4.3 inches ( 10 to 11 centimeters ) long . It has a bronze-green back , a pale gray chest and belly , and green flanks . Its bill is long , straight and slender . The adult male has an iridescent crimson-red crown and throat , and a dark , slightly forked tail . Anna 's is the only North American hummingbird species with a red crown . Females and juveniles have a green crown , a gray throat with some red markings , a gray chest and belly , and a dark , rounded tail with white tips on the outer feathers . These birds feed on nectar from flowers using a long extendable tongue . They also consume small insects caught in flight . A PBS documentary that first aired January 10 , 2010 shows how Anna 's Hummingbirds eat flying insects . They aim for the flying insect , then open their beaks very wide . That technique has a greater success rate than trying to aim the end of a long beak at the insect would have . While collecting nectar , they also assist in plant pollination . This species sometimes consumes tree sap . Open-wooded or shrubby areas and mountain meadows along the Pacific coast from British Columbia to Arizona make up C. annas breeding habitat . The female raises the young without the assistance of the male . The female bird builds a large nest in a shrub or tree , or in vines or on wires . The round , 3.8 t diameter nest is built of very small twigs , lichen and other mosses , and often lined with downy feathers or animal hair . The nest materials are bound together with spider silk or other sticky materials . They are known to nest early as mid-December and as late as June . Unlike most hummingbirds , the male Anna 's Hummingbird sings during courtship . The song is thin and squeaky . During the breeding season , males can be observed performing a remarkable display , called a display dive , on their territories . When a female flies onto a male 's territory , he rises up approximately 30 m before diving over the recipient . As he approaches the bottom of the dive the males reach an average speed of 27 m\/s , which is 385 body lengths per second . At the bottom of the dive the male travels 23 m , and produces a loud sound described by some as an `` explosive squeak '' with their outer tail-feathers . Anna 's Hummingbirds will sometimes hybridize with other species , but this is not very common . These natural hybrids have been mistaken for new species . A bird , allegedly collected in BolaÃ os , Mexico , was described and named Selasphorus floresii ( Gould , 1861 ) , or Floresi 's Hummingbird . Several more specimens were collected in California over a long period , and the species was considered extremely rare . It was later determined that the specimens were the hybrid offspring of an Anna 's Hummingbird and an Allen 's Hummingbird . A single bird collected in Santa Barbara , California , was described and named Trochilus violajugulum ( Jeffries , 1888 ) , or Violet-throated Hummingbird . It was later determined to be a hybrid between an Anna 's Hummingbird and a Black-chinned Hummingbird . Anna 's Hummingbirds are found along the western coast of North America , from southern Canada to northern Baja California , and inland to southern Arizona . They tend to be permanent residents within their range , and are very territorial . However , birds have been spotted far outside their range in such places as southern Alaska , Saskatchewan , New York , Florida , Louisiana and Newfoundland _ ( island ) . Anna 's hummingbirds are the only hummingbirds to spend the winter in northern climates ; they are able to do this as there are enough winter flowers and food to support them . During cold temperatures , Anna 's Hummingbirds gradually gain weight during the day as they convert sugar to fat . In addition , hummingbirds with inadequate stores of body fat or insufficient plumage are able to survive periods of sub-freezing weather by lowering their metabolic rate and entering a state of torpor . There are an estimated 1.5 million Anna 's Hummingbirds . Their population appears to be stable , and they are not considered an endangered species .
Sivasspor is a Turkish sports club based in Sivas , Turkey . They plays in the Turkish SÃ 1\/4 per Lig . Sivasspor were originally formed on May 14 , 1932 in Sivas as Sivas GenÃ lik . They sported KÄ rmÄ zÄ - Beyaz ( Red-White ) shirts and Beyaz ( White ) shorts . They played many matches at the amateur level in their early years before they were allowed to play professionally . By the mid-1960s , Sivas GenÃ lik merged with Yolspor and KÄ zÄ lÄ rmak . They had hoped that this merger would help their push to join the professional leagues , the league closed their doors to Sivasspor once more . There were several boycotts until July 1 , 1967 , when Sivasspor was allowed to play professional football in Turkey . Sivasspor started out in the Second League , White Group . Due to there being many new clubs , the Turkish Football Federation decided to create a third league . They were permitted into the Second League along with Afyonspor , BalÄ kesirspor , Giresunspor , Kastamonuspor , Malatyaspor , Orduspor , UÅ akspor , and Taksim GK . During their first professional season , Sivasspor finished 16th in their group , a mere 4 points from relegation . They also finished in the bottom half of the table the following season . They approached to First League in 1971 â `` 72 and 1972 â `` 73 seasons but finished 2nd after orderly Å ekerspor and Adana Demirspor and did n't promote to it . Sivasspor would remain in the lower leagues until winning the Second League in 2005 , gaining automatic promotion . The club finished 8th in their first season in the Turkcell Super League . Werner Lorant lead the team to key victories over clubs like BeÅ iktaÅ J.K. and GenÃ lerbirliÄ i. At the end of their first season in the top flight , they finished with a record of ten wins , thirteen draws , and eleven losses , totaling out to 43 points . The clubthen finished 4th in the 2007 â `` 08 season , finishing on the same number of points as the second and third place teams but with an inferior goal difference . TSivasspor had the championship in their sights until the penultimate match , when they were beaten 5-3 by eventual champions Galatasaray . The 2008 â `` 09 season saw them finish 2nd after leading the table for much of the season . The finished behind leaders BeÅ iktaÅ by 5 points . On September 17 , 1967 during a match against Kayseri Erciyesspor ( Then Kayserispor ) played at the Kayseri AtatÃ 1\/4 rk Stadium , a disaster occurred with 40 dead and at least 300 injuries among the fans , which was the worst sporting-related event in Turkey . The match was finished 1 â `` 0 favor of Kayseri side . After the disaster , Kayseri Erciyesspor and Sivasspor played different groups of 2nd league until 1990 â `` 91 season . The two teams played in Fourth Group of Third League ( now TFF Second League ) in this season and were reconciled . Kayseri Erciyesspor were champions and promoted to Second League .
The Tyrrhenian Sea is part of the Mediterranean Sea off the western coast of Italy . The sea is bounded by Corsica and Sardinia ( to the west ) , Tuscany , Lazio , Campania , Basilicata and Calabria ( to the east ) and Sicily ( to the south ) . The maximum depth of the sea is 3785 m. The Tyrrhenian Sea is situated near where the African and European Plates meet ; therefore mountain chains and active volcanoes such as Mount Marsili are found in its depths . The eight Aeolian Islands are located in the southern part of the sea , north of Sicily . The Tyrrhenian Sea is divided into two basins ( or plains ) , the Vavilov plain and the Marsili plain . They are separated by the undersea ridge known as the Issel Bridge , after Arturo Issel . Its name derives from the Greek name for the Etruscans , who were said to be emigrants from Lydia and led by the prince Tyrrhenus . The Etruscans settled along the coast of modern Tuscany and referred to the water as the `` Sea of the Etruscans '' . In Greek mythology , it is believed that the cliffs above the Tyrrhenian Sea housed the four winds kept by Aeolus . Winds are Mistral from the RhÃ ne valley , Libeccio from the south-west , Sirocco and Ostro from the south .
The Prestige is a 1995 novel by British writer Christopher Priest . The novel is epistolary in structure ; that is , it purports to be a collection of real diaries that were kept by the protagonists and later collated . The title derives from the novel 's fictional practice of stage illusions having three parts : the setup , the performance , and the prestige ( effect ) . The novel received the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for best fiction and the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel . Alfred Borden and Rupert `` Robbie '' Angier rise to become world-renowned stage magicians . Early in their careers , they meet but a bitter feud develops as they ruin each other 's acts . The frame story involves the great-grandchildren of Borden and Angier and their investigations into how their own lives have been affected by their ancestors ' conflict . The events of the past are revealed primarily through each of the magicians ' diaries . Borden develops a teleportation act called The Transported Man , and an improved version named The New Transported Man , which appears to move him from one closed cabinet to another in the blink of an eye without appearing to pass through the intervening space . The act seems to defy physics and puts all previous acts to shame . Over the course of the diaries we learn Alfred Borden is a name used by identical twin brothers , Albert and Frederick . Both men are living the life of Alfred , committed to maintaining their secret to ensure their professional success with The New Transported Man . Angier suspects that Borden uses a double but dismisses the idea when he can not find evidence to prove it . Unable to discern the method that Borden uses , Angier desperately tries to equal him , and with the help of the acclaimed physicist Nikola Tesla , develops an act named In A Flash , which has a similar result , though a starkly different method . For Angier 's trick , Tesla successfully creates a device capable of teleporting a being from one place to another , but which has a surprising side-effect . As well as re-creating the subject wherever is deigned by the device , the original , now lifeless body of the subject is also left behind in its original position forcing Angier to devise a way to drop it out of sight to preserve the illusion . Angier , with bitter humor , refers to these shells as ` prestiges ' . Angier 's new act is equal to Borden 's . Borden , in retaliation , attempts to discover how In A Flash is performed . During one performance he breaks into the backstage area , and turns off the power to Angier 's device , though he does not discover what it does , during the act itself . As a result , the teleportation is incomplete , and both the new Angier and the old , ` prestige ' Angier continue to live , though the old feels constantly weak while the new seems to have a lack of physical substance . The real Angier fakes the death of his magic act alter-ego and returns to his family estate , where he becomes terminally ill. The clone Angier , alienated from the world by his ghostly form and realizing Borden 's secret , attacks one of them before a performance . However , Borden 's apparent poor health and Angier 's sense of morality intervene and Angier does not carry through with the murder . It is implied that this Borden dies a few days later , and the incorporeal Angier travels to meet the corporeal Angier , now living as Lord Colderdale . They obtain Borden 's diary and publish it after omitting the brothers ' secret . Shortly afterwards , the corporeal Angier dies and his ghostly twin uses the device to teleport himself into the body , hoping that either he would return it back to life and be one person again or kill himself instantly . It is discovered in the final chapter that some form of Angier has continued to survive to the present day . A motion picture adaptation , directed by Christopher Nolan , was released on October 20 , 2006 in the United States It stars Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as Borden and Angier respectively , as well as Michael Caine , Scarlett Johansson and David Bowie . The novel was adapted by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan .
Latina is the capital of the province of Latina in the Lazio region , in central Italy . The city has about 115,426 inhabitants and is thus the second largest city of the region . It was founded in 1932 under the name Littoria when the area surrounding it , which had been a swamp since Antiquity , was drained . Latina was founded by Benito Mussolini on June 30 , 1932 as `` Littoria '' , named for the fascio littorio . The city was inaugurated on December 18 of the same year . Littoria was populated with settlers coming mainly from Friuli and Veneto , who formed the so-called Venetian-Pontine community ( today surviving only in some peripherical boroughs ) . The edifices and the monuments , mainly in rationalist style , were designed by famous architects and artists such as Marcello Piacentini , Angiolo Mazzoni and Duilio Cambellotti . In 1934 it became a provincial capital and , after World War II , renamed Latina in 1946 . With the arrival of other people mostly from Lazio itself , the original Venetian-like dialect was increasingly substituted by a form of Romanesco dialect . The city has some pharmaceutical , chemical industry , cheese production and has a strong service sector . Latina is also an important center for agriculture ( vegetables , flowers , sugar , fruit , cheese and derivates ) . The former Latina nuclear power plant is now shutdown and undergoing decommissioning . Latina Scalo , Latina Lido , Borgo Sabotino , Borgo Santa Maria , Borgo Bainsizza , Borgo Montello , Borgo Podgora , Borgo Piave , Borgo Carso , Chiesuola , Tor Tre Ponti , Borgo Faiti , Borgo San Michele , Borgo Grappa , Borgo Isonzo . Latina is located in the Province of Latina , part of the southern section of the region of Lazio . The city is about 62 k south of Rome The municipality borders on Aprilia , Cisterna di Latina , Nettuno , Pontinia , Sabaudia , Sermoneta and Sezze . Latina has a Mediterranean climate ( KÃ ppen climate classification Csa ) like most of southern Italy . The Italian film My Brother Is an Only Child is set in Latina .
The terpsitone was an electronic musical instrument , invented by LÃ on Theremin , which consisted of a platform fitted with space-controlling antennae , through and around which a dancer would control the musical performance . By most accounts , the instrument was nearly impossible to control . Of the three instruments built , only the last one , made by Theremin in 1978 for his niece Lydia Kavina , survives today . The instrument was named after the Greek muse of dance , Terpsichore ( from the Greek words Ï Î Ï Ï Ï , `` delight '' , and Ï oÏ Ï Ï , `` dance '' ) .

Alexander Francis Wojciechowicz ( August 12 , 1915 -- July 13 , 1992 ) was a professional American football player in the National Football League . He was an NFL Hall of Famer as a offensive lineman and linebacker for the Detroit Lions and Philadelphia Eagles . Producer Danny Arnold , a New Yorker and fan of Fordham University athletics , named one of the detectives on the sitcom Barney Miller Stan Wojciehowicz , in honor of Wojie . He played college football at Fordham University , the center on the famed Seven Blocks of Granite offensive line , which included an undersized right guard named Vince Lombardi . He was named All-American in 1936 and 1937 and was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1955 . Wojciechowicz was the Detroit Lions ' first pick in the 1938 NFL Draft and won the starting center job in his first game as a Lion . Even though the Lions were in decline as a team , Alex would play with full effort on both offense and defense . In 1944 , he demonstrated his defensive talents when he intercepted seven passes , a Lions record for several years . Although Wojciechowicz received his fair share of personal recognition , he yearned to play on a championship team . That never happened in Detroit . But when he was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles in the middle of the 1946 season , the two-time All-Pro selection joined a team that seemed poised to deliver him his dream . At age 30 , Wojciechowicz went to the Eagles as their most well-known defensive player . His veteran leadership made him a major contributor to the Eaglesâ championship runs in 1948 and 1949 . From the time he was picked as Detroit 's number-one draft choice in 1938 until he retired in 1950 after 13 seasons of professional football . He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1968 . A resident of South River , New Jersey , he died there on July 13 , 1992 at the age of 76 .

Minimal genomes for minimal multicellular organisms may pave the way to understand such complex processes in vivo . The 1920s was the decade that started on January 1 , 1920 and ended on December 31 , 1929 . It is sometimes referred to as the Roaring Twenties or the Jazz Age , when speaking about the United States , Canada or the United Kingdom . In Europe the decade is sometimes referred to as the `` Golden Twenties '' because of the economic boom following World War I. Since the end of the 20th century , the economic strength during the 1920s has drawn close comparison with the 1950s and 1990s , especially in the United States of America . These three decades are regarded as periods of economic prosperity , which lasted throughout nearly each entire decade . Each of the three decades followed a tremendous event that occurred in the previous decade ( World War I and Spanish flu in the 1910s , World War II in the 1940s , and the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s ) . However , not all countries enjoyed this prosperity . The Weimar Republic , like many other European countries , had to face a severe economic downturn in the opening years of the decade , because of the enormous debt caused by the war as well as the Treaty of Versailles . Such a crisis would culminate with a devaluation of the Mark in 1923 , eventually leading to severe economic problems and , in the long term , favor the rise of the Nazi Party . Additionally , the decade was characterized by the rise of radical political movements , especially in regions that were once part of empires . Communism began attracting large numbers of followers following the success of the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks ' determination to win the subsequent Russian Civil War . The Bolsheviks would eventually adopt a policy of mixed economics , from 1921 to 1928 , and also give birth to the Soviet Union , at the end of 1922 . The 1920s marked the first time in the United States that the population in the cities surpassed the population of rural areas . This was due to rapid urbanization starting in the 1920s . The 1920s also experienced the rise of the far right and fascism in Europe and elsewhere , being perceived as a solution to prevent the spread of Communism . The knotty economic problems also favored the rise of dictators in Eastern Europe and the Balkans , such as JÃ zef PiÅ sudski in the Second Polish Republic and Peter and Alexander KaraÄ ` orÄ ` eviÄ in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia .
In physics , a lever ( from French lever , `` to raise '' , cf . a levant ) is a rigid object that is used with an appropriate fulcrum or pivot point to either multiply the mechanical force ( effort ) that can be applied to another object or resistance force ( load ) , or multiply the distance and speed at which the opposite end of the rigid object travels . This leverage is also termed mechanical advantage , and is one example of the principle of moments . A lever is one of the six simple machines . The earliest remaining writings regarding levers date from the 3rd century BC and were provided by Archimedes . `` Give me a place to stand , and I shall move the earth with a lever '' is a remark of Archimedes who formally stated the correct mathematical principle of levers ( quoted by Pappus of Alexandria ) . It is assumed that in ancient Egypt , constructors used the lever to move and uplift obelisks weighting more than 100 tons . The force applied ( at end points of the lever ) is proportional to the ratio of the length of the lever arm measured between the fulcrum ( pivoting point ) and application point of the force applied at each end of the lever . Mathematically , this is expressed by , where is the force , is the perpendicular distance between the force and the fulcrum , and is the turning force known as the moment or torque . For the classical mechanics formulas to work , or to be a good approximation of real world applications , the lever must be made from a combination of rigid bodies , ( i.e. , a beam ) and a rigid fulcrum . Any bending or other deformation must be negligible .

Pedobear is an Internet meme that became popular through the imageboard 4chan . As the name suggests ( `` pedo '' being short for pedophile ) , it is portrayed as a pedophilic bear . The image was described as a mascot among pedophiles , and cosplay participants dressed as the character were accused of being pedophiles , after the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff 's Department issued a warning that Pedobear was a sign of the presence of pedophiles and other people with inappropriate sexual behavior . The bear character originates from the popular bulletin board system ( BBS ) website 2channel in Japan , where it was introduced as ã ã ã 1\/4 ( KumÄ ) , which is an interjection of the word ã ã 3\/4 ( Kuma ) meaning bear in Japanese . In spite of the impression of Pedobear in Europe and the United States , KumÄ is not associated with any sexual thing such as pedophilia . Pedobear is a popular joke on the website 4chan , which adopted the character primarily as a way to get users to start posting child pornography or sexualized images of children . Pedobear eventually became known outside 4chan as it was referenced by newspapers and prominent websites . Pedobear has been associated with the pedophilia scandals involving priests ; the character was used in a CollegeHumor video . On 3 July 2009 , Canadian artist Michael R. Barrick created two composite images depicting Pedobear grouped together with the mascots of 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games . One is based on the official art , and the other is based on a fanart created by Angela Melick . This image was then mistakenly used by other media , most notably the Polish newspaper Gazeta OlsztyÅ ska for a 4 February 2010 front page story about the Olympics in Vancouver . On 24 July 2009 , a column by conservative commentator Pat Buchanan about the early months of Barack Obama 's presidency included an image of Pedobear , which generated considerable reaction from non-political commentators . In June 2010 , felt collages depicting icons from video game and internet culture , including Pedobear , were presented at Brooklyn 's Renegade Craft Fair . Other uses of Pedobear include an iStockphoto wallpaper , a cover of the auto magazine Import Tuner , and a flyer of a costume store in Portland , Oregon which accidentally featured a Pedobear-like figure , being later covered by a local news station , which provided a detailed history of Pedobear , and even interviewed Cheezburger Network 's CEO Ben Huh about Pedobear 's cultural significance . In December 2010 Big Fish Games published a flash game called `` Teddy Bear 's Christmas '' featuring Pedobear as the main character . The game was removed later . On March 22 , 2011 , internet blog Urlesque posted a photograph of a coupon book advertisement for a Florida-based computer parts distribution service called â CP Distributor . â Whether the inclusion of Pedobear was intentional or accidental remains unclear , but the combination of child pornography mascot and the â CP Distributorâ seems highly exploitable .
Tomohiro Hasumi ( born 6 June 1972 ) is a former Japanese football player .
Terry Goodkind ( born 1948 in Omaha , Nebraska , USA ) lives in the Western United States . Goodkind is a contemporary American writer and author of the best-selling epic fantasy series The Sword of Truth which , by August 2006 , had more than 10 million copies in print and had been translated into 20 different languages . In a recent Publishers Weekly article , it was reported that Goodkind has sold 25 million copies worldwide . Goodkind was born in 1948 and raised in Omaha , Nebraska , where he also attended schooling in art and Catholic Catechism Instruction . Goodkind learned early in his life that he suffered from dyslexia , a cause of constant frustration while he was in high school . He later dropped out of college and has worked as a carpenter , a violin maker , and a restorer of rare and exotic artifacts and antiques . Before starting his career as a writer , Goodkind was best known for his realistic marine and wildlife paintings . In 1993 , during the construction of his home on the forested Mount Desert Island off the coast of Maine with his wife Jeri , he began to write his first novel , Wizard 's First Rule , and his writing career was launched with its publication in 1994 . In addition to his home in Maine , Goodkind and his wife built a second home in the desert southwest where he now spends the majority of his time . Goodkind 's first book , Wizard 's First Rule , was auctioned to publishers in 1994 for six times more than the record price previously paid for a first fantasy novel . It had a first print run of 60,000 copies , where 3,000 â `` 5,000 is more usual , and became an international bestseller . Goodkind has subsequently published 11 other novels and one novella to great commercial success . All of his books , with the exceptions of Stone of Tears and Wizard 's First Rule , have appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List . Of his latest novels , Chainfire , debuted at # 3 ; in January 2005 , Phantom at # 1 in August 2006 ; and Confessor at # 2 in November 2007 on the NYT Best Sellers List . While he acknowledges writing in the fantasy genre , he perceives his novels to be more than just traditional fantasy because of their focus on philosophical and human themes . Goodkind believes that using the fantasy genre allows him to better tell his stories and better convey the human themes and emotions that he desires to share with the reader . Regardless of the genre of his novels , Goodkind states his main goal in writing is to inspire . Goodkind has been largely influenced by the books of Ayn Rand and is a strong supporter of her works and of Objectivist philosophy . `` To the people in the United States Intelligence Community , who , for decades , have valiantly fought to preserve life and liberty , while being ridiculed , condemned , demonized , and shackled by the jackals of evil '' . Goodkind wrote a novella titled Debt of Bones for the 1998 anthology Legends , edited by Robert Silverberg . The novel takes place in the Sword of Truth universe and is set a few decades before the events in the main series . In 2001 , the story was published as a stand-alone book . The last book in the current story arc , titled Confessor , was released on November 13 , 2007 . In June 2008 , Goodkind signed a contract to publish three mainstream novels with G.P. Putnam 's Sons\/Penguin Books . The first of these novels is titled The Law of Nines , and was released August 18 , 2009 . In April 2010 , Goodkind signed a contract to publish three fiction novels with Tor Books . The first of these will be a new Richard and Kahlan novel . The teaser announcement was released April 1 , on Terry Goodkind 's official website . The title of the new Richard and Kahlan novel was announced on June 14 , 2010 . The new novel will be called The Omen Machine and will be published in early 2011 by Tor Books . On July 24 , 2006 , it was originally announced that the Sword of Truth series would be produced as a mini-series . According to the press release , Sam Raimi , the director of Spider-Man , and Joshua Dohen would produce the mini-series . However , in January 2008 , it was announced that a full series would be produced instead by ABC Studios . As of Comic-Con 2008 , the series was dubbed Legend of the Seeker . Sam Raimi , Robert Tapert , Joshua Donen , and Ned Nalle served as executive producers . The first episode aired in syndication on November 1 , 2008 . The show lasted for two seasons , with the final episode airing the weekend of May 22 , 2010 .
MiklÃ s `` Miki '' FehÃ r ( 20 July 1979 â '' 25 January 2004 ) was a Hungarian footballer , who played as a striker . On 25 January 2004 , FehÃ r died of a cardiac arrest during a match between VitÃ ria de GuimarÃ # es and his team Benfica in GuimarÃ # es , Portugal . FehÃ r started his playing career at GyÅ ` ri ETO FC , where he was spotted by F.C. Porto scouts . He was signed in 1998 but never really made a breakthrough onto the team . Relatively young , he was loaned to gain experience , to another two northern sides , S.C. Salgueiros and Sporting de Braga . At Braga , FehÃ r had his best professional season , netting 14 goals in 26 matches in 2000 â `` 01 . After Porto chairman Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa quarreled with agent JosÃ Veiga ( FehÃ r 's agent ) , FehÃ r refused to let go of his agent and left . He joined Lisbon side S.L. Benfica , going on to score seven goals in 29 matches during two seasons . On 25 January 2004 , Benfica traveled to GuimarÃ # es to play against VitÃ ria de GuimarÃ # es . The game was being broadcast live on television , and Benfica was leading 1 â `` 0 . FehÃ r had just come on as a substitute . He assisted another player brought from the bench , Fernando Aguiar , for the match 's only goal , but received a yellow card in injury time and suddenly bent forward , seemingly in pain . He then fell backwards to the ground . Teammates rushed immediately to aid FehÃ r before medical personnel arrived on the pitch . CPR was performed as players looked on in visible distress . An ambulance arrived on the pitch and FehÃ r was rushed to the hospital . His condition was covered by the Portuguese media throughout the day . However , before midnight , FehÃ r 's death was confirmed . The cause of death was cardiac arrhythmia , brought on by Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . In his memory , Benfica retired the number 29 shirt , which he wore during his time at the club . He was remembered by many and his death caused a profound shock in Portuguese sports . Among others , Reinaldo Teles ( director of football of Porto ) and JosÃ Mourinho ( Porto 's manager at the time ) paid their respects at the EstÃ dio da Luz , where the player 's body remained before his burial in his native Hungary . A club delegation , which included the entire squad , traveled to Hungary , presenting FehÃ r 's parents with the 2004 â `` 05 league championship medal , in respect for the player and his time with the club . On 9 October 2009 , the day before their World Cup qualifier against Portugal in Lisbon , the Hungarian national team squad laid a wreath next to a metal bust of Feher at Benfica 's homeground EstÃ dio da Luz , in tribute to his memory . FehÃ r made his first international appearance for Hungary in October 1998 against Azerbaijan , and went on to score seven goals in 25 international matches . On 11 October 2000 , he netted a hat-trick in a 6 â `` 1 away thrashing of Lithuania , in a 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifier .
The following list of cat breeds includes domestic cat breeds and domestic\/wild hybrids . The list includes established breeds recognized by various cat registries , new and experimental breeds , distinct domestic population not being actively developed and lapsed breeds . Inconsistency in breed classification among registries means that an individual animal may be considered different breeds by different registries . For example , The International Cat Association 's Himalayan is considered a colorpoint version of the Persian by the Cat Fanciers ' Association while the CFA 's Javanese is considered a color variation of the Balinese by TICA . The domestic shorthair and domestic longhair are not breeds but terms used in cat fancy to describe cats that do not belong to a particular breed .

Trichomes ( from the Greek Ï Ï Î Ï Ï Î 1\/4 Î - trikhoma meaning `` growth of hair '' ) are fine outgrowths or appendages on plants and certain protists . These are of diverse structure and function . Examples are hairs , glandular hairs , scales , and papillae . Certain -- usually filamentous -- algae , have the terminal cell produced into an elongate `` hair-like '' structure called a trichome . The same term is applied to such structures in some cyanobacteria . Trichomes on plants are epidermal outgrowths of various kinds . The terms emergences or prickles refer to outgrowths that involve more than the epidermis . This distinction is not always easily applied ( see Wait-a-minute tree ) . Also , there are nontrichomatous epidermal cells that protrude from the surface . A common type of trichome is a hair . Plant hairs may be unicellular or multicellular , branched or unbranched . Multicellular hairs may have one or several layers of cells . Branched hairs can be dendritic ( tree-like ) , tufted , or stellate ( star-shaped ) . A common type of trichome is the scale or peltate hair : a plate or shield-shaped cluster of cells attached directly to the surface or borne on a stalk of some kind . Any of the various types of hairs may be glandular . In describing the surface appearance of plant organs , such as stems and leaves , many terms are used in reference to the presence , form , and appearance of trichomes . The most basic terms used are glabrous -- lacking hairs -- and pubescent -- having hairs . Details are provided by : Hairs on plants are extremely variable in their presence across species , location on plant organs , density ( even within a species ) , and therefore functionality . However , several basic functions or advantages of having surface hairs can be listed . It is likely that in many cases , hairs interfere with the feeding of at least some small herbivores and , depending upon stiffness and irritability to the `` palate '' , large herbivores as well . Hairs on plants growing in areas subject to frost keep the frost away from the living surface cells . In windy locations , hairs break-up the flow of air across the plant surface , reducing evaporation . Dense coatings of hairs reflect solar radiation , protecting the more delicate tissues underneath in hot , dry , open habitats . And in locations where much of the available moisture comes from cloud drip , hairs appear to enhance this process . Root hairs , the rhizoids of many vascular plants , are tubular outgrowths of trichoblasts , the hair-forming cells on the epidermis of a plant root . That is , root hairs are lateral extensions of a single cell and only rarely branched . Just prior to the root hair development , there is a point of elevated phosphorylase activity . Root hairs vary between 5 and 17 micrometres in diameter , and 80 to 1,500 micrometres in length ( Dittmar , cited in Esau , 1965 ) . Root hairs can survive for 2 to 3 weeks and then die off . At the same time new root hairs are continually being formed at the top of the root . This way , the root hair coverage stays the same . It is therefore understandable that repotting must be done with care , because the root hairs are being pulled off for the most part . This is why planting out may cause plants to wilt . Though trichomes are rarely found preserved in fossils , trichome bases are regularly found , and in some cases their cellular structure is an important diagnostic with respect to systematics .
A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship . The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is a Formula One race . It was announced in early 2007 at the Abu Dhabi F1 Festival in the United Arab Emirates . The first race took place on November 1 , 2009 , held at the Hermann Tilke designed Yas Marina Circuit . On June 25 , 2008 the FIA announced the provisional Formula One calendar including the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as the 19th and final race of the season on November 15 . On November 5 , 2008 , however , it was announced that the race would be held as the season finale on November 1 , two weeks before the initially planned date , as the 17th and final race . The race was Formula One 's first ever day-night race , starting at 17:00 local time . Floodlights used to illuminate the circuit were switched on from the start of the event to ensure there is a seamless transition from daylight to darkness . Formula 1 first came to Abu Dhabi in 2007 in the guise of the first ever Formula One Festival . Announced in January 2007 , the event which took place on 3 February 2007 was free , and the largest gathering of current Formula One cars and drivers outside of a Grand Prix . At the festival it was announced that Abu Dhabi had won the rights to host a Grand Prix from 2009 until 2016 . Later that year , Etihad Airways negotiated a three-year deal for them to become sponsors of the Grand Prix . For the 2009 Formula One season , the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was added to the schedule . It was provisionally announced as being held on 15 November 2009 , as the 19th and final Grand Prix of the season . Both the Canadian Grand Prix and French Grand Prix were later removed from the provisional schedule , and as a result the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was moved to 1 November 2009 where it would become the last of 17 meetings . In August 2009 , it was announced that the start time would be 1700 local time ( 1300 UTC ) , and that the race would be floodlit . The inaugural race was won by Sebastian Vettel for Red Bull Racing . For the 2010 Formula One season , the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was held on the Yas Marina Circuit , for the weekend of 12 , 13 , 14 November 2010 . The first race in Abu Dhabi in 2009 was a dead rubber as the both championships had been sealed in Brazil . This time the drivers championship was decided in Abu Dhabi for the first time . With favorite Fernando Alonso losing out and Sebastian Vettel completing his second victory and subsequently sealing the world championship . It has been revealed that the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix will be the 19th and second last race of the 2011 Formula One season . The race will take place on 13 November , the last race of the season will be the Brazilian Grand Prix on 27 November . The Yas Marina Circuit is located on Yas Island -- a 2550 h island on the east coast of Abu Dhabi -- and the 2009 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was the first major event to take place on the circuit .

Horst Eckel ( born 8 February 1932 ) is a former German football player . He was part of the West German team that won the 1954 FIFA World Cup . He also participated in the 1958 FIFA World Cup . In total he earned 32 caps . During his club career he played for 1 . FC Kaiserslautern and SV RÃ chling VÃ lklingen .

He won the German football championship with Kaiserslautern in 1951 and 1953 . Eckel was playing as a right half back . As a player , Eckel was assiduous and adroit . During the 1954 FIFA World Cup Eckel became an important pillar of the successful West German team . The strength of the right side of Sepp Herberger 's team was made possible due to Eckel 's high defensive workrate and his passes , from which outside right Helmut Rahn and inside right Max Morlock benefitted enormously . After his career , he retrained from toolmaker to teacher , a profession he practiced until his retirement . He was an advisor for SÃ nke Wortmann 's movie about the 1954 FIFA World Cup , The Miracle of Bern .
Peter Michael Ainsworth ( born 16 November 1956 ) is a former Conservative politician in the United Kingdom . He was the Member of Parliament for East Surrey from 1992 to 2010 .

The son of a naval officer , Ainsworth was educated at the Ludgrove School in Wokingham , Bradfield College , and Lincoln College , Oxford , from which he graduated in 1979 , with an MA in English Literature and Language . On leaving university he became a researcher to the former Conservative Member of the European Parliament , Sir John Stewart-Clark , and then in 1981 became a merchant banker . He worked as an investments analyst for Laing & Cruickshank Investment Management ( bought by UBS in 2004 ) from 1981-5 , and then in corporate finance for S.G. Warburg Securities ( bought by UBS in 1994 ) from 1985 â `` 92 , where he became a director from 1990-2 .

He was elected as a councillor to the London Borough of Wandsworth in 1986 and at the 1992 general election was elected to Parliament for the seat of East Surrey , succeeding Sir Geoffrey Howe . In 1994 Ainsworth became the Parliamentary Private Secretary ( PPS ) to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury , Jonathan Aitken , and in 1995 became PPS to the Secretary of State for National Heritage , Virginia Bottomley . He was promoted by John Major in 1996 to the Whips ' Office .

In 1998 he entered the Shadow Cabinet , shadowing the Department for Culture , Media and Sport and from 2001 the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs . Ainsworth resigned from Iain Duncan Smith 's frontbench for family reasons in 2002 . From 2003 he chaired the Environmental Audit Select Committee , before rejoining the Shadow Cabinet under David Cameron in December 2005 as Shadow Secretary of State for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs . The post has had a heightened importance given the Conservative 's new emphasis on environmental policies under Cameron . Speaking in March 2006 , Ainsworth set out the possible new direction for Conservative policy stating that `` Achieving a sustainable world and combating the threat of climate change will require some really fresh ideas and radical thinking . We can not expect to meet the challenges of this century by toying with the structures and technologies we have inherited from the past , and the concept of Decentralised Energy should to be taken seriously . '' Ainsworth was notable as the only member of the shadow cabinet to have voted against the war in Iraq . Ainsworth lost his position in the Shadow Cabinet in the January 2009 reshuffle when Nick Herbert took the post of Shadow Secretary of State for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs .
This article is about the vertebrate jawbone . For the arthropod mandibles , see Mandible ( arthropod mouthpart ) and Mandible ( insect mouthpart ) . See also : Human mandible and Mandibular ( disambiguation ) . In vertebrates , the mandible , lower jaw or jawbone is a bone forming the skull with the cranium . In lobe-finned fishes and the early fossil tetrapods , the bone homologous to the mandible of mammals is merely the largest of several bones in the lower jaw . In such animals , it is referred to as the dentary bone , and forms the body of the outer surface of the jaw . It is bordered below by a number of splenial bones , while the angle of the jaw is formed by a lower angular bone and a suprangular bone just above it . The inner surface of the jaw is lined by a prearticular bone , while the articular bone forms the articulation with the skull proper . Finally a set of three narrow coronoid bones lie above the prearticular bone . As the name implies , the majority of the teeth are attached to the dentary , but there are commonly also teeth on the coronoid bones , and sometimes on the prearticular as well . This complex primitive pattern has , however , been simplified to various degrees in the great majority of vertebrates , as bones have either fused or vanished entirely . In teleosts , only the dentary , articular , and angular bones remain , while in living amphibians , the dentary is accompanied only by the prearticular , and , in salamanders , one of the coronoids . The lower jaw of reptiles has only a single coronoid and splenial , but retains all the other primitive bones except the prearticular . While , in birds , these various bones have fused into a single structure , in mammals most of them have disappeared , leaving an enlarged dentary as the only remaining bone in the lower jaw - the mandible . As a result of this , the primitive jaw articulation , between the articular and quadrate bones , has been lost , and replaced with an entirely new articulation between the mandible and the temporal bone . An intermediate stage can be seen in some therapsids , in which both points of articulation are present . Aside from the dentary , only few other bones of the primitive lower jaw remain in mammals ; the former articular and quadrate bones survive as the malleus and the incus of the middle ear . Finally , the cartilagenous fish , such as sharks , do not have any of the bones found in the lower jaw of other vertebrates . Instead , their lower jaw is composed of a cartilagenous structure homologous with the Meckel 's cartilage of other groups . This also remains a significant element of the jaw in some primitive bony fish , such as sturgeons .

The Arockalypse is the third studio album by the hard rock band Lordi . It features the hit single `` Hard Rock Hallelujah '' , which won the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 for Finland . The album has sold triple platinum in Finland and gold in Sweden and Germany . The album cover features OX and Awa , but it was Kalma and Enary who played bass and keyboards on the album . The Arockalypse features many guest-stars on its tracks : Dee Snider and Jay Jay French from Twisted Sister , Udo Dirkschneider from Accept and Bruce Kulick from Kiss . Before the album was released in Finland , there were rumors about other possible guest-stars to feature on the album , including Sebastian Bach from Skid Row , Alice Cooper , King Diamond , Rob Zombie , and other members of Kiss , the latter being Lordi 's greatest influence . In reality , only Sebastian Bach and Alice Cooper were ever asked to be guests on the album , but neither were able to make it . In November 2006 , The Arockalypse was re-released in Finland as a `` Special Edition '' , which included 3 bonus tracks and a DVD . This version was also the first Lordi album to be released in the United States . Also , the song `` It Snows In Hell '' was slightly remixed for this version , using instead the music video version , which had a different set of vocals in the opening . In 2007 , a limited edition of The Arockalypse was released on vinyl in the US , available in four versions : black , clear , blue with red splatter or clear with red splatter . The album consists of two records and includes all the tracks from the special edition release , as well as three live bonus tracks on Side D :

The Old World consists of those parts of Earth known to classical antiquity and the European Middle Ages . It is used in the context of , and contrast with , the `` New World '' ( i.e. , the Americas ) . Oceania and Antarctica are also not considered part of the Old World . The Old World includes Africa , Asia , and Europe ( collectively known as Afro-Eurasia ) , plus surrounding islands ( or at least those parts which were known to classical geography before the 15th century ) . The mainland of Afro-Eurasia ( excluding islands such as the British Isles , Japan , Madagascar and the Malay Archipelago ) has been referred to as the World Island . ( The term may have been coined by Sir Halford John Mackinder in The Geographical Pivot of History . ) Medieval geography considered Asia as a continent â `` a distinct landmass . The European concept of the three continents in the Old World goes back to Classical Antiquity , but during the Middle Ages was notably due to Isidore of Sevilla ( see T and O map ) .
Makran was an autonomous princely state of both British India and Pakistan , which ceased to exist in 1955 . It was located in the extreme southwest of Pakistan , an area occupied by the districts of Gwadar , Kech and Panjgur . The state did not include the enclave of Gwadar which was under Omani rule until 1958 . The state of Makran was established in the eighteenth century . Ruled by the Sardars of the Gichki Family of Makran , a status which remained until 1948 . On 17 March 1948 , Makran acceded to Pakistan and on 3 October 1952 it joined Kalat , Kharan and Las Bela to form the Baluchistan States Union . The state was dissolved on 14 October 1955 when most regions of the western wing of Pakistan were merged to form the province of West Pakistan . When that province was dissolved in 1970 , the territory of the former state of Makran was organised as Makran District and later Makran Division of the province of Baluchistan ( later changed to Balochistan ) . The population of the province was mainly Baloch tribes with some Arabs and Iranians . The rulers of Makran were originally styled as Sardar and from 1922 as Nawab . Details on earlier rulers are sketchy with the first definite dates from 1898 CE onwards . The Gichki family ruled this region before the Makran State and after when the Makran State was formed the Gichki Sardar of Kech was made the Nawab of Makran .
The Nemean lion ( Greek , Î Î Ï Î 1\/2 Ï Î Ï Î Î Î 1\/4 Î Î Ï ( LÃ Å n tÄ `` s NemÃ as ) ; ) was a vicious monster in Greek mythology that lived at Nemea . It was eventually killed by Heracles . It could not be killed with mortal weapons because its golden fur was impervious to attack . Its claws were sharper than mortal swords and could cut through any armor . The lion is usually considered to have been the offspring of Typhon ( or Orthrus ) and Echidna ; it is also said to have fallen from the moon as the offspring of Zeus and Selene , or alternatively born of the Chimera . The Nemean lion was sent to Nemea in the Peloponnesus to terrorize the city . The first of Heracles ' twelve labors , set by King Eurystheus ( his cousin ) was to slay the Nemean lion . According to one version of the myth , the lion took women as hostages to its lair in a cave near Nemea , luring warriors from nearby towns to save the damsel in distress . After entering the cave , the warrior would see the woman ( usually feigning injury ) and rush to her side . Once he was close , the woman would turn into a lion and kill the warrior , devouring his remains and giving the bones to Hades . Heracles wandered the area until he came to the town of Cleonae . There he met a boy who said that if Heracles slew the Nemean lion and returned alive within 30 days , the town would sacrifice a lion to Zeus ; but if he did not return within 30 days or he died , the boy would sacrifice himself to Zeus . Another version claims that he met Molorchos , a shepherd who had lost his son to the lion , saying that if he came back within 30 days , a ram would be sacrificed to Zeus . If he did not return within 30 days , it would be sacrificed to him as a dead hero . While searching for the lion , Heracles fetched some arrows to use against it , not knowing that its golden fur was impenetrable ; when he found and shot the lion and firing at it with his bow , he discovered the fur 's protective property when the arrow bounced harmlessly off the creature 's thigh . After some time , Heracles made the lion return to his cave . The cave had two entrances , one of which Heracles blocked ; he then entered the other . In those dark and close quarters , Heracles stunned the beast with his club and , using his immense strength , strangled it to death . Others say that he shot arrows at it , eventually shooting it in the unarmored mouth . After slaying the lion , he tried to skin it with a knife from his belt , but failed . He then tried sharpening the knife with a stone and even tried with the stone itself . Finally , Athena , noticing the hero 's plight , told Heracles to use one of the lion 's own claws to skin the pelt . Others say that Heracles ' armor was , in fact , the hide of the lion of Cithaeron . When he returned , King Eurystheus was shocked . Eurystheus warned him that the tasks set for him would become increasingly difficult . He then sent Heracles off to complete his next quest , which was to destroy the Lernaean hydra .
Mass media refers collectively to all media technologies , including the Internet , television , newspapers , and radio , which are used for mass communications , and to the organizations which control these technologies . Since the 1950s , in the countries that have reached a high level of industrialization , the mass media of cinema , radio and TV have a key role in political power . Mass media play a significant role in shaping public perceptions on a variety of important issues , both through the information that is dispensed through them , and through the interpretations they place upon this information . The also play a large role in shaping modern culture , by selecting and portraying a particular set of beliefs , values , and traditions ( an entire way of life ) , as reality . That is , by portraying a certain interpretation of reality , they shape reality to be more in line with that interpretation . Contemporary research demonstrates an increasing level of concentration of media ownership , with many media industries already highly concentrated and dominated by a very small number of firms . The phrase `` the media '' began to be used in the 1920s , but referred to something that had its origins much further in the past . The invention of the printing press in the late 15th century gave rise to some of the first forms of mass communication , by enabling the publication of books and newspapers on a scale much larger than was previously possible . The first high-circulation newspapers arose in the eastern United States in the early 1800s , and were made possible by the invention of high-speed rotary steam printing presses , and railroads which allowed large-scale distribution over wide geographical areas . The increase in circulation , however , led to a decline in feedback and interactivity from the readership , making newspapers a more one-way medium . Since the beginning , high-circulation newspapers have been a medium for conditioning public opinion . In the 1840s , the first commercial electrical telegraph was developed , allowing to separate communications from transportation , enabling messages to be transmitted instantaneously over large distances . Cinema began to be a large-scale entertainment industry in 1894 , with the first commercial exhibition of film . The first films with a narrative bagan to be distributed in 1987 . The first commercial broadcasts in the United States began in the 1920s . The first television broadcasts for a mass audience began in 1936 Germany and UK . Regular mass TV broadcasts in the United States only began in 1948 , with a show hosted by Arturo Toscanini and starring comedian Milton Berle . Since the '50s , when cinema , radio and TV began to be the primary or the only source of information for a larger and larger percentage of the population , these media began to be considered as central instruments of mass control . Up to the point that it emerged the idea that when a country has reached a high level of industrialization , the country itself `` belongs to the person who controls communications . '' Mass media play a significant role in shaping public perceptions on a variety of important issues , both through the information that is dispensed through them , and through the interpretations they place upon this information . The also play a large role in shaping modern culture , by selecting and portraying a particular set of beliefs , values , and traditions ( an entire way of life ) , as reality . That is , by portraying a certain interpretation of reality , they shape reality to be more in line with that interpretation .

Susumu Tonegawa ( å æ å é Tonegawa Susumu , born September 6 , 1939 ) is a Japanese scientist who won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1987 for his discovery of the genetic mechanism that produces antibody diversity . Although he won the Nobel Prize for his work in immunology , Tonegawa is a molecular biologist by training . In his later years , he has turned his attention to the molecular and cellular basis of memory formation . Tonegawa is best known for elucidating the genetic mechanism in the adaptive immune system . To achieve the diversity of antibodies needed to protect against any type of antigen , the immune system would require millions of genes coding for different antibodies , if each antibody was encoded by one gene . Instead , as Tonegawa showed in a landmark series of experiments beginning in 1976 , genetic material can rearrange itself to form the vast array of available antibodies . Comparing the DNA of B cells ( a type of white blood cell ) in embryonic and adult mice , he observed that genes in the mature B cells of the adult mice are moved around , recombined , and deleted to form the diversity of the variable region of antibodies . Tonegawa was born in Nagoya , Japan and attended the Hibiya High School in Tokyo . He received his bachelor 's degree from Kyoto University in 1963 . He received his doctorate from the University of California , San Diego where he worked with Dr Masaki Hayashi . He did post-doctoral work at the Salk Institute in San Diego in the laboratory of Renato Dulbecco , then worked at the Basel Institute for Immunology in Basel , Switzerland , where he performed his landmark immunology experiments . In 1981 , he became a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and founded and directed what is now called the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT . In 1982 , he was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University together with Barbara McClintock , another Nobel Prize winner in 1983 . He is a member of the Scientific Board of Governors at The Scripps Research Institute . He is currently the director of the RIKEN-MIT Center for Neural Circuit Genetics at MIT . While he heads a full research laboratory at MIT , as of April 1 , 2009 , he serves as the director of the RIKEN Brain Science Institute ( BSI ) in Wako-shi , Japan .
Clerow Wilson , Jr. ( December 8 , 1933 -- November 25 , 1998 ) , known professionally as Flip Wilson , was an American comedian and actor . Wilson was the first African American entertainer to host his own weekly variety series , The Flip Wilson Show . The popular series earned Wilson a Golden Globe and two Emmy Awards . In January 1972 , Time magazine featured Wilson 's image on their cover and named him `` TV 's first black superstar '' . Born in Jersey City , New Jersey , he was one of eighteen children in an impoverished household . After years of bouncing from foster homes to reform school , 16-year-old Wilson lied about his age and joined the United States Air Force . His outgoing personality and funny stories made him popular ; he was even asked to tour military bases to cheer up other servicemen . Claiming that he was always `` flipped out '' , Wilson 's barracks mates gave him his famous nickname . Discharged in 1954 , Wilson started working as a bellhop in San Francisco 's Manor Plaza Hotel . At the Plaza 's nightclub , Wilson found extra work playing a drunken patron in between regularly scheduled acts . His inebriated character proved popular and Wilson began performing it in clubs throughout California . He managed to get jobs at various comedy clubs using his nickname , Flip . At first Wilson would simply ad-lib on-stage , but in time , he added written material and his act became more sophisticated . During the 1960s , Wilson became a regular at the Apollo Theater in Harlem and was a favorite guest on The Tonight Show , Laugh-In , and The Ed Sullivan Show . In 1970 , Wilson won a Grammy Award for his comedy album The Devil Made Me Buy This Dress . A routine titled `` Columbus , '' from the album Cowboys and Colored People , brought Wilson to Hollywood industry attention and would lead to the development of his own television show . In this bit , Wilson re-tells the story of Christopher Columbus from a slightly ` urban ' perspective , in which Columbus finally convinces the Spanish monarchs to fund his voyage by noting that discovering America means that he can thus also discover Ray Charles . Hearing this , Queen Isabella , sounding not unlike Wilson 's celebrated `` Geraldine , '' says that `` Chris '' can have `` all the money you want , honey -- You go find Ray Charles ! ! '' When Columbus departs from the dock , Isabella is there , testifying to one and all that `` Chris gonna find Ray Charles ! ! '' In 1970 , Wilson 's variety series , The Flip Wilson Show , debuted on NBC . He played host to many African-American entertainers , including The Jackson Five , and performed in comedy sketches . He greeted all his guests with the `` Flip Wilson Handshake , '' : four hand slaps , two elbow bumps finishing with two hip-bumps . George Carlin was one of the show 's writers along with him . Wilson 's characters included Reverend Leroy , pastor of the ` Church of Whatâ s Happening Now ' , and his most popular character , Geraldine Jones , always referring to boyfriend ` Killer ' and whose line â The devil made me do itâ became a national expression . The Flip Wilson Show aired through 1974 , generating high ratings and popularity among viewers and winning strong critical acclaim , with an unprecedented eleven Emmy Award nominations during its run , winning two . Wilson also won a Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Television Series . After the end of The Flip Wilson Show , Wilson went on to make guest appearances on numerous TV comedies and variety shows , such as Here 's Lucy starring Lucille Ball and The Dean Martin Show among others . Ed Sullivan invited Wilson to perform several times on his popular Sunday night show , and Wilson would later single out Sullivan as providing his biggest career boost . Wilson acted in TV and theatrical movies including Uptown Saturday Night and The Fish that Saved Pittsburgh . In 1976 , he appeared as the Fox in a television musical adaptation of Pinocchio , starring Sandy Duncan in the title role and Danny Kaye as Mister Geppetto , with songs by Laugh-In composer Billy Barnes . In 1984 , he hosted the remake of People Are Funny . From 1985 to 1986 , Wilson played the lead role in the CBS sitcom Charlie & Co. . Wilson 's last role was a cameo appearance in the sitcom Living Single in November 1993 . Wilson was married twice ; he married first wife , Lovenia Wilson , in 1957 : they divorced in 1967 . Then , in 1979 , he married Tuanchai MacKenzie . They divorced in 1984 . After winning custody of his children in 1979 , Wilson performed less in order to spend time with his family . Before becoming ill , he was an active lighter-than-air pilot . On November 25 , 1998 , Wilson died of liver cancer in Malibu , California , at the age of 64 . The phrase `` What you see is what you get '' was often used by Wilson 's Geraldine character and inspired researchers at PARC and elsewhere to create the acronym WYSIWYG .
Concentric objects share the same center , axis or origin with one inside the other . Circles , tubes , cylindrical shafts , disks , and spheres may be concentric to one another . Concentric objects generally have different radii , as concentric objects with the same radius are equal . One of the most familiar examples of concentric circles are the evenly spaced circles of a target used in target archery or firearms , and accordingly any concentric design may be called a `` target '' or a `` bullseye '' ( after the center ) . Concentric cable is a cable type used in TN-C-S earthing systems where the combined neutral and earth core completely surrounds the live core ( s ) . This minimizes the risk of completely cutting through the combined neutral and earth without first completely cutting through the live cores . Concentric muscles contractions are those in which the muscle shortens .
The skepticism turned to outrage when news surfaced that Sony , the distributor of Burlesque , had `` treated '' Globes voters to an all-expenses-paid trip to Las Vegas , culminating in a concert by Cher , the film 's star . Allmusic ( previously All Music Guide or AMG , stylized as allmusic ) is a service of music guide , owned by All Media Guide . Allmusic was founded in 1991 by popular-culture archivist Michael Erlewine as a guide for consumers . Its first reference book was published the following year . AMG on the Internet predates the World Wide Web and was first available as a Gopher site . Reviewers include Jason Ankeny , Roxanne Blanford , Marisa Brown , John Bush , Al Campbell , Eugene Chadbourne , Matt Collar , Ken Dryden , Bruce Eder , Stephen Thomas Erlewine , Katherine Fulton , Jo-Anne Greene , David Jeffries , Thom Jurek , Andy Kellman , Rudyard Kennedy , Don Kline , the late Cub Koda , Andrew Leahey , Steve Leggett , Jason Lymangrover , Scott McClintock , Greg McIntosh , Opal Louis Nations , Wilson Neate , Heather Phares , Greg Prato , Ned Raggett , Margaret Reges , Eduardo Rivadavia , John Phillip Roberts , William Ruhlmann , Tim Sendra , Michael Sutton , Rob Theakston , Richie Unterberger , Joe Viglione , Sean Westergaard , and Scott Yanow . Allmusic also claims to have the largest digital archive of music , including about six million digital songs , as well as the largest cover art library , with more than half a million cover image scans . The website allmusic.com is a sample of what is available in the database . The site was launched in 1995 as an online demonstration for potential database licensees of the breadth of content included in the database . The Allmusic database is also used by several generations of Windows Media Player and Musicmatch Jukebox to identify and organize music collections . Windows Media Player 11 and the integrated MTV Urge music store have expanded the use of Allmusic data to include related artists , biographies , reviews , playlists and other data . Allmusic is also used to provide catalog data , artist biographies , album reviews , related artist information , playlists and other information in the iTunes Music Store , Zune Marketplace , Zune player , eMusic , AOL , Yahoo ! , Amazon.com and other music stores . Allmusic is also at the heart of the Naim Extended Music database used by the Naim HDX hard disk player . The web version of AMG has much more information on most forms of popular music than the 1,176 pages of the 1992 book edited by Michael Erlewine and Scott Bultman ( All Music Guide : the best CDs , albums & tapes , published by Miller Freeman Inc. , San Francisco ) , but it is missing much of the information on classical music that appeared in the book . One could look up a composer in the book and identify specific recordings recommended by AMG reviewers , but the website only provides a list of recordings .
Timo Hildebrand ( born 5 April 1979 ) is a German professional football goalkeeper who currently plays for Sporting CP after his contract with TSG 1899 Hoffenheim was not renewed in the summer of 2010 . Hildebrand holds a Bundesliga record for keeping a clean sheet for 884 consecutive minutes in 2003 â `` 04 . After starting his career at the little known FV Hofheim\/Ried , Hildebrand joined the Stuttgart youth team in 1994 . From the summer of 2000 , he was the club 's number one goalkeeper and contributed largely to Stuttgart 's successes , particularly as part of what became known as `` Stuttgart 's young wild ones '' team under coach Felix Magath who , due to financial restraints , had to rely on young players . Largely thanks to Hildebrand 's steady performances , VfB Stuttgart managed to be Bundesliga runners-up in 2003 and survived the Champions League group stage the following season , before bowing out to Chelsea FC in the second round . Hildebrand also played a significant role in Stuttgart 's victorious 2006 â `` 07 Bundesliga campaign , figuring as a backbone for the next generation of `` wild ones '' like Serdar Tasci or Mario Gomez and helping Stuttgart provide the third-best defense of the season . The 2006-07 campaign remains his greatest domestic success to this day , and his last season with Stuttgart as in December 2006 he did not accept the club 's offer to extend his contract . Hildebrand joined the Spanish club Valencia on a free transfer on 3 July 2007 , with Valencia unveiling Hildebrand via a news conference the next day on 4 July 2007 . He stated in the news conference that he would `` give everything '' to the club . Hildebrand was being viewed as a replacement to the club 's long-serving goalkeeper Santiago CaÃ izares . He made his debut for Valencia on 29 August , for the third qualification round second leg of UEFA Champions League against IF Elfsborg . He played the full 90 minutes of that game . Hildebrand was Valencia 's first-choice goalkeeper for most part of the 2007-08 season , collecting a Copa del Rey trophy on the way . After Ronald Koeman 's departure as Valencia manager , Hildebrand lost his place in the first team as Koeman 's successor Unai Emery preferred newly signed Renan Brito instead . According to media coverage , he refused to take place on the bench and was eventually cut from the squad altogether . Hildebrand had not been playing for Valencia for several months since the Supercopa de EspaÃ a second leg on 24 August 2008 . On 4 December 2008 , he left Valencia by mutual consent . On 10 December 2008 , Hildebrand signed for the Bundesliga side 1899 Hoffenheim . He made his Bundesliga debut for Hoffenheim on 31 January 2009 in their 2 â `` 0 win at home to Energie Cottbus , being substituted in the 60th minute due to an injury . In summer 2010 Hildebrand left Hoffenheim . Hildebrand signed a one-year deal with Portuguese Sporting CP and debuted on 16 October 2010 in a 2 â `` 1 win over GD Estoril Praia in the Portuguese cup . After collecting 18 Under-21-caps , Hildebrand made his full international debut for Germany on 28 April 2004 in a friendly against Romania in Bucharest as he came on to substitute Oliver Kahn after the first half and a 0 â `` 4 halftime score ( Germany eventually lost 1 â `` 5 ) . Hildebrand participated in three consecutive tournaments for Germany , Euro 2004 , 2005 Confederations Cup and World Cup 2006 , as Germany 's third-choice goalkeeper , playing his first competitive game for Germany at the 2005 Confederations Cup against Argentina ( final score 2-2 ) . After Kahn 's retirement from international football in 2006 , Hildebrand stepped up to become Germany 's number 2 and was Jens Lehmann 's natural replacement during the Euro 2008 qualification . Somewhat surprisingly , Joachim LÃ w dropped Hildebrand from the final squad for the tournament and picked Robert Enke and RenÃ Adler ahead of him . Although LÃ w stated that Hildebrand was an important player and may return to the set-up in near future , he has yet to appear for Germany since Euro 2008 .
Pakistan Tamaddun Majlish ( commonly known as Tamaddun Majlish ) ( Bangla : à à 3\/4 à à à à à à 3\/4 à à à à à à à à à à à à à ) was an Islamic cultural organization in erstwhile East Pakistan , now known as Bangladesh . Tamddun Majlish was the founder of the historic Language Movement . It was established immediately after the partition of India on September 1 , 1947 in Dhaka by Principal Abul Kashem , who also was a professor of the Physics department of Dhaka University at that time . Tamaddun Majlish was very active during the initial part of its existence . It played a vital role at the first part of the Bengali Language Movement . The members of this organization were influenced to a marked extent by the mentality of the Calcutta Renaissance Society . After the partition , Majlish realized that , Pakistan was no longer run by the idealism that it promised . This drifted most of the members of the Tamuddun Majlish away from the Muslim League . Although the main intent of Tamaddun Majlish was to invigorate Islamic spirit and culture among the citizens of the new nation of Pakistan , the vigorous role played by this pro-Islamic organization made it clear to the Bengali speaking Muslim population of East Pakistan that the demand for adopting Bengali as one of the State languages was `` not at all motivated by the anti-state elements and communists of East Bengal . '' Tamuddun Majlis issued on September 15 , 1947 , a well-written pamphlet titled Pakistaner Rashtra Bhasha : Bangla Na Urdu ? ( `` Pakistanâ s State Language : Bangla or Urdu ? '' ) . Among the authors of this historic booklet , Kazi Motahar Hossain , Abul Mansur Ahmed and Principal Abul Kashem ( General Secretary of Tamuddun Majlish ) made a strong case in favor of introducing Bengali as the only language of instruction , offices and courts of East Bengal . They also forcefully articulated the demand for Bengali to be one of the State languages of Pakistan . The seminal booklet also contained a succinct proposal , authored by Principal Abul Kashem in favor of Bengali language . Given the landmark nature of the demand for recognition of Bengali , the gist of that proposal is listed as follows : Aimed at providing an organized resistance against the anti-Bengali policies of the Central Government of Pakistan and to lodge protest against the irresponsible and slanderous comments about Bengali language and script made by Fazlur Rahman , the Central Education Minister , the Tamuddun Majlish took the lead in the formation of the first Rastrabhasa Sangram Parishad ( State Language Movement Council ) in October 1947 . While Professor Nurul Huque Bhuyain of Dhaka University was elected to be the Convenor of the first Rastrabhasa Sangram Parishad , Professor Abul Kashem , the General Secretary of Tamudhun Majlish , played a pivotal role in that rudimentary stage of the language movement . Professor Abul Kashem , almost a forgotten hero of the earlier phases of the Bengali language movement , provided a yeomanâ s service for garnering widespread support for adopting Bengali as one of the State languages of Pakistan . He succeeded in enlisting of the younger generations in general , and the teachers and students of Dhaka University and other educational institutions , in particular . Thus the first Rastrabhasa Sangram Parishad provided the needed organizational structure for launching the language movement in later part of 1947 and early months of 1948 . The first protest meeting was assembled at the campus of Dhaka University on December 6 , 1947 , under the auspices of Rastrabhasa Sangram Parishad , to protest the unilateral decision of the National Education Conference , held in Karachi , for adopting Urdu as the only State language of Pakistan . The protest meeting had attracted a large number of students , teachers and informed public from Dhaka University and other educational institutions . While the protest meeting was presided over by Professor Abul Kashem , a number of students and teachers including Munir Choudhury , Abdur Rahman , Kallayan Dasgupta , A.K.M. Ahsan , S. Ahmed , and Farid Ahmed , the Vice President of Dhaka University Central Students Union ( DUCSU ) addressed the public meeting . Position of Tamuddun Majlish about the Bengali Language Movement also reflected the aspirations of the common people of East Bengal . Tamuddun Majlish published a weekly named Shaptahik Shainik in 1948 , it was call as mouthpiece of the Bengali Language Movement which was active in encouraging the ideals of Bengali Language Movement . It was published till 1961 .
An emirate is a political territory that is ruled by a dynastic Muslim Monarch styled emir . Etymologically emirate or amirate ( , ImÄ rah ; plural : Ø Ù Ø Ø Ø Ø , ImarÄ t ) is the quality , dignity , office or territorial competence of any emir ( prince , governor etc. ) . The United Arab Emirates is a federal state that comprises seven federal emirates , each administered by a hereditary emir , these seven forming the electoral college for the federation 's President and Prime Minister . As most emirates have either disappeared , been integrated in a larger modern state or changed their rulers ' styles , e.g. to Malik ( Arabic for King ) or Sultan , such true emirate-states have become rare . Furthermore , in Arabic the term can be generalized to mean any province of a country that is administered by a member of the ruling class , especially of a member ( usually styled emir ) of the royal family , as in Saudi Arabian governorates .

The London Underground 1960 Stock was a small , prototype class of electric multiple unit designed for the London Underground Central Line . The aluminium-bodied motor cars were built by Cravens of Sheffield and entered service in late 1960 . The driving motor cars were numbered 3900-3911 although the first two cars were delivered by Cravens numbered 3000 and 3001 but were renumbered 3900 and 3901 before entering service . To make the sets up to four cars , each incorporated two trailer cars which were rebuilt from old Pre-1938 Standard Stock . Two units were intended to be coupled together , forming an eight-car train . The 1960 Stock initially ran on the main Central Line , before being cascaded to the Hainault Loop . Rather than build a production version of the 1960 Stock , a new Central Line fleet of 1962 Stock was opted for ( based on the tried and tested 1959 Stock ) . One of the main factors in this decision was the cost of refurbishing the Standard Stock cars to run with the new stock driving motor cars . Much of the experience gained from the 1960 Stock was subsequently used on the 1967 Stock built for the Victoria Line . Initially the 1960 stock cars were coupled to two modernized `` Standard Stock '' trailers dating from the 1920s , numbered 4900-4911 . Originally the cars were to have numbered starting at 4000 . The 1920s built trailer cars were withdrawn between 1975 and 1983 and replaced by single 1938 Stock cars marshalled between the two motor cars , reducing the units from four to three cars . Four 1938 Stock trailers were rebuilt , three were for use in revenue service , numbered 4921 , 4927 , and 4929 . The fourth was for use with the track recording train and was renumbered TRC912 but was never used as such . Instead it remained stored until 2006 , when it was scrapped by Booths at their Rotherham plant . The 1960 Stock trains ran mainly on the Hainault loop ; most were modified experimentally for Automatic Train Operation ( ATO ) in the mid 1960s . The lightly used Woodford-Hainault section of the Central Line was used as a testing ground for full ATO on the Victoria Line . With ATO , the driver only needed to press two buttons simultaneously to start the train - all other operation was automatic . Towards the end of its life a 3-car 1960 stock train ( not in ATO mode ) operated the peak-only Epping-Ongar shuttle . The 1960 stock was withdrawn when that line closed in September 1994 . One of the 1960 Stock trains is still owned by LUL and remains in use as track recording unit , running with a 1973 Stock center trailer .
Libertia is a genus of monocotyledenous plants in the family Iridaceae containing 15 species in the southern hemisphere . A number of species are endemic to New Zealand . They are all perennials growing from short woody rhizomes , with simple , linear or narrowly lanceolate basal leaves which are often green but may be red or yellow depending on the species . The showy white trimerous flowers are open in spring and are followed by capsules opening by three valves which contain the numerous black seeds . The genus was named after Anne-Marie Libert ( 1782 â `` 1865 ) , a Belgian botanist .
Mixosaurus is an extinct genus of ichthyosaur . Fossils of Mixosaurus have been found all over the world - China , Timor , Indonesia , Italy , Spitsbergen , Svalbard , Canada , Alaska , and Nevada . It was named in 1887 by George H. Baur . The name means `` Mixed Lizard '' , and was chosen because it appears to have been a transitional form between the eel-shaped ichthyosaurs such as Cymbospondylus and the later dolphin-shaped ichthyosaurs , such as Ichthyosaurus . Mixosaurus was a relatively small ichthyosaur , at just 1 m in length . It possessed a long tail with a low fin , suggesting it could have been a slow swimmer , but also possessed a dorsal fin for stability in the water . The paddle-like limbs were made up of five toes each , unlike the three toes found in later ichthyosaurs . Noteworthy , however , is that each toe had more individual bones than is usual in reptiles , and the front limbs were longer than the back limbs , both adaptations typical of later ichthyosaurs . The jaws were narrow , with several sharp teeth , that would have been ideal for catching fish . Dixon , Dougal . `` The Complete Book of Dinosaurs . '' Hermes House , 2006 .

Vibo Valentia is a city and comune ( municipality ) in the Calabria region of southern Italy , near the Tyrrhenian Sea . It is the capital of the province of Vibo Valentia , and is an agricultural , commercial and tourist center ( the most famous places nearby are Tropea , Ricadi and Pizzo ) . There are also several large manufacturing industries , including the tuna district of Maierato . Very important for the local economy is the Vibo Marina 's harbor . Vibo Valentia was originally the Greek colony of Hipponion . It was founded , probably around the late 7th century BC , by inhabitants of Locri , a principal city of the Italian Magna Graecia , south of Vibo Valentia on the Ionian Sea . Diodorus Siculus reports that the city was taken in 388 BC by Dionysius the Elder tyrant of Syracuse , who deported all the population . The population came back in 378 BC , with the help of the Carthaginians . In the following years Hipponion came under the dominion of the Bruttii , who controlled most of Calabria . After the town fell to Rome , the name was Latinized to Hipponium . The town became a Roman colony in 194 BC with the name of Vibo Valentia . After a phase of prosperity during the late Republic and early Empire , the town was almost completely abandoned after the fall of the Western Roman Empire . In 1070 the Normans built a castle at the site of the old Acropolis and in 1235 a new city was established by Frederick II , Holy Roman emperor and king of Sicily , with the name of Monteleone . The city got back the old Roman name of Vibo Valentia only in 1928 .

Repulse Bay is an area in the southern part of Hong Kong Island , located in the Southern District , Hong Kong . In 1841 , the bay was used as a base by pirates and caused serious concern to foreign merchant ships trading with China . The pirates were subsequently repulsed by the British Fleet ; hence the name . Another theory holds that the bay was named after HMS Repulse which was stationed at the bay at one point . In the 1910s , Repulse Bay was developed into a beach , and the Repulse Bay Hotel was built in 1920 . To attract swimmers , a bus route from Central to Repulse Bay was created , and now stands as one of Hong Kong 's oldest bus routes . During the Battle of Hong Kong in World War II , Repulse Bay was an important strategic location . The beach was extended artificially , and thus the sand closer to the shore is coarser than that further away . Until the early 1960s , residential buildings were quite restricted . Three blocks of six storey apartments were developed by Dr. P. P. Chiu and his brother P. W. Chiu , part way up the mountain overlooking Repulse Bay . These were luxury apartments with servants ' quarters , with only two apartments per floor in Blocks A and B. Apartments in Block C are smaller . For a long time , these were the only apartments allowed on the mountain . Occupying the whole of the west side cliff above the beach was a large castle with a swimming pool , greenhouse and tennis court called Eucliffe , one of three castles owned by the millionaire Eu Tong Sween . The Eucliffe structure and historical site was demolished to make way for an elegant row of low apartments . The Repulse Bay area is one of the most expensive housing areas in Hong Kong . The prices are matched only by the Peak . In 2006 , some property prices reached HK$ 20,000 ( US$ 2,500 ) per square foot . The former Repulse Bay Hotel was demolished in 2 stages during the 1970s and 1980s . Later a boutique shopping mall was constructed on part of the old hotel site to mimic some of the lost colonial architecture . Stanley Ho owns both 1 Repulse Bay Road and 4 Repulse Bay Road . Repulse Bay is served by Repulse Bay Road , which connects Wong Nai Chung Gap Road and Tai Tam Road . It is very convenient for people to travel to Repulse Bay as there many bus routes from Central , such as no. 6 , 6A , 6X , 260 ; or the no. 40 minibus . Transportation either takes you express through the Aberdeen Tunnel , or along the slightly longer scenic route . Beach-goers may also opt to drive there . The beach provides some parking space , and the nearby Repulse Bay Hotel also has parking facilities . Author Eileen Chang 's novel , Love in a Fallen City ( å 3\/4 å ä æ ) is set at the Repulse Bay Hotel .
The home and studio were designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1997 . A turkey is a large bird in the genus Meleagris . One species , Meleagris gallopavo , commonly known as the Wild Turkey , is native to the forests of North America . The domestic turkey is a descendant of this species . The other living species is Meleagris ocellata or the Ocellated Turkey , native to the forests of the YucatÃ n Peninsula . There are several extinct species dating from as far back as 23 million years ago . Turkeys are classed in the taxonomic order of Galliformes . Within this order they are relatives of the grouse family or subfamily . Turkeys have a distinctive fleshy wattle that hangs from the underside of the beak , and a fleshy protuberance that hangs from the top of its beak â '' called a snood . With wingspans of 1.0 - , the turkeys are by far the largest birds in the open forests in which they live . As in many galliform species , the male ( tom or gobbler ) is larger and much more colorful than the female ( hen ) . When Europeans first encountered turkeys on the American continent , they incorrectly identified the birds as a type of guineafowl ( Numididae ) , also known as turkey fowl ( or turkey hen and turkey cock ) , due to the birds ' importation to Central Europe through Turkey . That name , shortened to just the name of the country , stuck as the name of the American bird . The confusion between these kinds of birds from related , but different , families is also reflected in the scientific name for the turkey genus : meleagris is Greek for guineafowl . Two major reasons why the name ` turkey fowl ' stuck to Meleagris rather than to the guinea fowl ( Numida meleagris ) were the genuine belief that the newly-discovered Americas were in fact a part of Asia , and the tendency during that time to attribute exotic animals and foods to a place that symbolized far-off , exotic lands . ( The Ottoman Empire , where Turkey was located , represented the exotic East . ) Several other birds , which are sometimes called turkeys , are not particularly closely related : the Australian Brush-turkey is a megapode , and the bird sometimes known as the `` Australian Turkey '' is , in fact , the Australian Bustard , a gruiform . The bird sometimes called a Water Turkey is actually an Anhinga ( Anhinga rufa ) , from the shape of its own spread of tail feathers when fully deployed for drying . The domesticated turkey is attributed to Aztec agriculture , and originated from the South Mexican subspecies M.g. gallopavo found in the area bounded by the present states of Jalisco , Guerrero , and Veracruz . The 16th-century English navigator William Strickland is generally credited with introducing the turkey into England . His family coat of arms â '' showing a turkey cock as the family crest â '' is among the earliest known pictures of a turkey . English farmer Thomas Tusser notes the turkey being among farmer 's fare at Christmas in 1573 . The domestic turkey was sent from England to Jamestown , Virginia in 1607 . A document written in 1584 lists supplies to be furnished to future colonies in the New World ; `` turkies , male and female '' . Names given to a group of turkeys include rafter , gobble , and flock . While large domesticated turkeys are generally unable to fly , smaller , lighter domesticated turkeys known as `` heritage turkeys '' and `` wild turkeys '' can fly . In domesticated turkeys , the ability to fly depends directly on weight , while even heavy adult wild turkeys can fly well enough to avoid predators by taking off and flying up to 100 y and perching in tree branches . Turkey poults ( goblets ) can not fly for the first two weeks after hatching . Many turkeys have been described from fossils . The Meleagrididae are known from the Early Miocene ( c. 23 mya ) onwards , with the extinct genera Rhegminornis ( Early Miocene of Bell , U.S. ) and Proagriocharis ( Kimball Late Miocene\/Early Pliocene of Lime Creek , U.S. ) . The former is probably a basal turkey , the other a more contemporary bird not very similar to known turkeys ; both were much smaller birds . A turkey fossil not assignable to genus but similar to Meleagris is known from the Late Miocene of Westmoreland County , Virginia . In the modern genus Meleagris , a considerable number of species have been described , as turkey fossils are robust and fairly often found , and turkeys show great variation among individuals . Many of these supposed fossilized species are now considered junior synonyms . One , the well-documented California Turkey Meleagris californica , became extinct recently enough to have been hunted by early human settlers and it is believed its demise was due to the combined pressures of climate change at the end of the last glacial period and hunting . The modern species and the California Turkey seem to have diverged approximately one million years ago .

The side were relegated to Serie C in his first season , but he helped them achieve promotion back to Serie B in 1988 . He moved to Serie A giants Juventus in 1989 , having scored 28 goals in 94 games for Monza . His goalscoring record in Turin was modest , achieving a best tally of 8 goals in 24 appearances in the 1990-1 season and a total of 20 in 98 games for the club . While at Juventus , he helped the side win two UEFA Cups ( in 1990 and 1993 ) and one Italian Cup , also in 1990 . He scored in the first leg of the 1990 UEFA Cup Final to help them beat Fiorentina .

He found his opportunities limited in his final season , with manager Sven-G Ã ran Eriksson preferring Alen BokÅ iÄ and Roberto Mancini in attack and sought a move away . Casiraghi joined English side Chelsea in May 1998 for Â # 5.4 million . His time in west London proved luckless , and ultimately only scored one competitive goal for the club , which came against Liverpool in a 1-1 draw at Anfield .

He was a member of the Italy squad that reached the final of USA 94 , playing in the group games against Norway and Mexico and the semi-final against Bulgaria . He was also a member of the Italy side at Euro 96 , scoring both goals in a 2-1 win against Russia , but was guilty of missing a late chance against the Czech Republic that could have proved vital to the group standings , and as such the side was knocked out in the first round . Despite sealing Italy 's qualification for France 98 with the only goal in a play-off against Russia in November 1997 , he failed to make the squad . He became manager of Italian Serie C2 side A.C. Legnano in May 2003 . On July 24 , 2006 , he was appointed joint coach of the Italian Under-21 national team alongside former Chelsea team mate Gianfranco Zola , succeeding Claudio Gentile .

The word is perhaps an English corruption of a word meaning boomerang taken from one of the Western Desert languages , for example , the Warlpiri word karli . Niflheim ( or Niflheimr ) ( `` Mist Home '' , the `` Abode of Mist '' or `` Mist World '' ) is one of the Nine Worlds and is a location in Norse mythology which overlaps with the notions of Niflhel and Hel . The name Niflheimr only appears in two extant sources , Gylfaginning and the much debated Hrafnagaldr Ã `` Ã ins . According to Gylfaginning , it was one of the two primordial realms , the other one being Muspelheim , the realm of fire . Between these two realms of cold and heat , creation began . Later , it became the location of Hel , the abode of those who did not die a heroic death . In Gylfaginning by Snorri Sturluson , Gylfi , the king of Sweden , receives an education in Norse mythology from Odin in the guise of three men . Gylfi learns from Odin ( as JafnhÃ rr ) that Niflheimr was the first world to be created after Muspelheim : Hel thus became the mistress of the world of those dead in disease and old age .
Sarlat-la-Can Ã da , or simply Sarlat , is a commune in the Dordogne department in Aquitaine in south-western France . Sarlat is one of the most attractive and alluring towns in south-western France . Population ( 1999 ) : 9,707 . The town of Sarlat is in a region known in France as the PÃ rigord Noir ( the Black PÃ rigord , as opposed to the Green PÃ rigord , the White PÃ rigord , and the Purple PÃ rigord ) . Sarlat is a medieval town that developed around a large Benedictine abbey of Carolingian origin . The medieval Sarlat Cathedral is dedicated to Saint Sacerdos . Because modern history has largely passed it by , Sarlat has remained preserved and one of the towns most representative of 14th century France . It owes its current status on France 's Tentative List for future nomination as a UNESCO World Heritage site to the enthusiasm of writer , resistance fighter and politician AndrÃ Malraux , who , as Minister of Culture ( 1960 â `` 1969 ) , restored the town and many other sites of historic significance throughout France . The center of the old town consists of impeccably restored stone buildings and is largely car-free . The town and region have featured in two major Hollywood films : Ridley Scott 's The Duellists ( 1978 ) based on Joseph Conrad 's Napoleonic tale ; and more recently Timeline ( 2003 ) adapted from Michael Crichton 's time-travel novel , set in 14th century France .

There is also an asteroid called 1809 Prometheus . Prometheus ( , ; or as in Greek Î Ï Î Î 1\/4 Î Î Î Ï Ï ) is an inner satellite of Saturn . It was discovered in 1980 ( some time before October 25 ) from photos taken by the Voyager 1 probe , and was provisionally designated ' . In late 1985 it was officially named after Prometheus , a Titan in Greek mythology . It is also designated ' . This small moon is extremely elongated , measuring about 119 by 87 by 61 km . It has several ridges and valleys and a number of impact craters of about 20 km diameter are visible , but it is less cratered than nearby Pandora , Epimetheus and Janus . From its very low density and relatively high albedo , it seems likely that Prometheus is a very porous icy body . There is a lot of uncertainty in these values , however , and so this remains to be confirmed . Prometheus acts as a shepherd satellite for the inner edge of Saturn 's F Ring . Recent images from the Cassini probe show that the Promethean gravitational field creates kinks and knots in the F Ring as the moon ` steals ' material from it . The orbit of Prometheus appears to be chaotic , as a consequence of a series of four 121:118 mean motion resonances with Pandora . The most appreciable changes in their orbits occur approximately every 6.2 years , when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus and the moons approach to within about 1400 km . Prometheus is itself a significant perturber of Atlas , with which it is in a 53:54 mean longitude resonance .
While the Persian mathematician JamshÄ `` d al-K Ä shÄ `` claimed to have discovered decimal fractions himself in the 15th century , J. Lennart Berggren notes that he was mistaken , as decimal fractions were first used five centuries before him by the Baghdadi mathematician Abu ` l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi as early as the 10th century . This template builds nicer-looking common fractions . It takes one , two or three parameters : the optional integer ( may be signed ) , the optional numerator and the required denominator ; in this order . ; : ( integer , numerator and denominator ) ; : ( numerator and denominator ) ; : ( denominator only ) This template differs from in that it tries to use precomposed glyphs and otherwise just inserts a proper fraction slash and possibly a thin space , but does not superscript the numerator and subscript the denominator . To allow numerical sorting of a column containing fractions , use instead .

The first two years of The Mark Twain Prize ( Richard Pryor and Jonathan Winters ) were taped and broadcast on Comedy Central . Since then , the award presentations have been taped for broadcast on PBS . In 2007 , the Mark Twain Prize celebrated its 10th anniversary and presented the prize to Billy Crystal . For the first time in 10 years , the show was held in the Opera House of The Kennedy Center on October 11 , 2007 and was broadcast on November 12 , 2007 on PBS . The evening 's presenters included Bob Costas , Robert De Niro , Danny DeVito , Jimmy Fallon , Whoopi Goldberg , John Goodman , David Letterman , Jon Lovitz , Rob Reiner , Paul Shaffer , Martin Short , Joe Torre , Barbara Walters and Robin Williams .

The World Heavyweight Championship is a professional wrestling world heavyweight championship in World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) . It is one of the world titles of the SmackDown brand , complementing the WWE Championship . It was established by WWE in 2002 after WWE bought out World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) and Extreme Championship Wrestling ( ECW ) , and split its roster into two franchises , Raw and SmackDown , in a brand extension . WWE 's original world title , the WWE Championship ( then known as the Undisputed Championship ) , was designated to the SmackDown brand , which resulted in this World Heavyweight Championship being established and designated to the Raw brand As affirmed by WWE , the World Heavyweight Championship is not a continuation of the WCW Championship , but rather its successor by way of the WWE Undisputed Championship , just as the WCW Championship spun off from the NWA World Heavyweight Championship . For a list of champions who have held those titles , see List of WCW World Heavyweight Champions and List of NWA World Heavyweight Champions respectively . The championship is generally contested in professional wrestling matches , in which participants usually execute scripted finishes rather than contend in direct competition .

`` Iron Man '' is a song by British heavy metal band Black Sabbath from their second studio album Paranoid released in 1970 . It was later included on their initial greatest hits compilation We Sold Our Soul for Rock 'n' Roll ( 1976 ) , as well as all subsequent greatest hits compilations . Many musical acts have recorded cover versions of the song , and the song is frequently used and referenced during sporting events and in television shows and films . A live performance of this song was made for the program Beat-Club . The title of the song was conceived by Ozzy Osbourne . Geezer Butler took to writing the lyrics around the title . The song was originally entitled `` Iron Bloke '' . Upon hearing the main guitar riff for the first time , Osbourne remarked that it sounded `` like a big iron bloke walking about '' . The title was later changed to `` Iron Man '' . Despite the song 's title , it bears no connection to the Marvel super hero character Iron Man . Butler wrote the lyrics as the story of a vengeful villain . Nonetheless , instrumental sections of the song would be used decades later in the 2008 feature film Iron Man at the beginning of the credits , and in the television commercials . The lyrics tell the story of a man who time travels into the future of the world , and sees the apocalypse . In the process of returning to the present , he is turned into steel by a magnetic field . He is rendered mute , unable verbally to warn people of his time of the impending destruction . His attempts to communicate are ignored and mocked . This causes Iron Man to become angry , and have his revenge on mankind , causing the destruction seen in his vision .

For the film , see Second in Command . The Second-in-Command ( 2i\/c or 2IC ) is the deputy commander of any British Army or Royal Marines unit , from battalion or regiment downwards . He or she is thus the equivalent of an Executive Officer in the United States Army . This terminology is also used in many other Commonwealth armies . The Second-in-Command of a battalion or regiment is usually a Major . The Second-in-Command of a company , squadron or artillery battery ( in which he or she is called the Battery Captain ) is usually a Captain ( although infantry company Second-in-Commands were usually Lieutenants until after the Second World War ) , the Second-in-Command of a platoon or troop is the Platoon or Troop Sergeant , and the Second-in-Command of a section is usually a Lance Corporal . In the Royal Navy , the second-in-command of a vessel is known as the First Lieutenant or Executive Officer . Less formally , `` second-in-command '' is a term used , usually unofficially and sometimes jocularly , for any deputy . Its basic meaning is `` someone who relieves a commander '' . When first-in-command is absent , second-in-command will assume the duties thereof .
Sodium selenite is a salt , a colourless solid , and the most common water-soluble selenium compound . It has the formulas Na2SeO3 and Na2SeO3 ( H2O ) 5 ( CAS # 26970-82-1 ) . Respectively , these are the anhydrous salt and its pentahydrate . This hydrated salt is the more common one . The hydrated and anhydrous salts behave identically for most purposes , although their molar masses differ . SeO2 + 2 NaOH â ' Na2SeO3 + H2O Acidification of selenium dioxide gives selenous acid , which , unlike sulfurous acid , can be isolated at room temperature . Akin to the related salt sodium sulfite , Na2SeO3 features a pyramidal dianion SeO with a trigonal ( C3v ) symmetry . Oxidation of this anion gives sodium selenate , Na2SeO4 . Together with the related barium and zinc selenites , sodium selenite is mainly used in the manufacture of colorless glass . The pink color imparted by these selenites cancels out the green color imparted by iron impurities . Because selenium is an essential element , sodium selenite is an ingredient in some food supplements . The US Food and Drug Administration approved a selenium supplement to animal diets , however the most common form is sodium selenite for pet foods . According to one article , `` not much was known about which selenium compounds to approve for use in animal feeds when the decisions were made back in the 1970s . . At the time the regulatory action was taken , only the inorganic selenium salts ( sodium selenite and sodium selenate ) were available at a cost permitting their use in animal feed . â Selenium is toxic in high concentrations . The chronic toxic dose for human beings is about 2.4 to 3 milligrams of selenium per day .

Trippin is a 2005 MTV environmental documentary television series hosted by Cameron Diaz . It also features many other celebrities , including Drew Barrymore , Redman , Jessica Alba , Eva Mendes , Mark Hoppus and Justin Timberlake . On the show , said celebrities visit various ecological locales around the world , in particular underprivileged areas of the world . George Ouzounian criticised the show in a May 2005 article on his website , The Best Page in the Universe , stamping it hypocritical and patronising . As Ouzounian points out , the show promotes the awareness of frugality in the third world through the visiting of high-profile , wealthy Westerners . The show has also attracted criticism from the Cybercast News Service for reasons similar to those outlined by Ouzounian . CNS claims Trippins hosts overlook key socioeconomic issues existing in the countries visited , including Bhutan , and make such serious matters seem trivial in comparison to the supposed advantages of frugal living ( e.g. actress Drew Barrymore was enthralled at Bhutan 's lack of sanitary services ) .

This article is about the Dickens character . For the musical band of the same name , see Uriah Heep ( band ) . Uriah Heep is a fictional character created by Charles Dickens in his novel David Copperfield . The character is notable for his cloying humility , obsequiousness , and insincerity , making frequent references to his own '' ` umbleness '' . His name has become synonymous with being a yes man . He is the central antagonist of the later part of the book . David first meets the 15-year-old Heep when he is living with Mr. Wickfield and his daughter Agnes , in chapter 15 : ( Uriah 's face ) was quite as cadaverous as it had looked in the window , though in the grain of it there was that tinge of red which is sometimes to be observed in the skins of red-haired people . It belonged to a red-haired personâ '' a youth of fifteen , as I take it now , but looking much olderâ '' whose hair was cropped as close as the closest stubble ; who had hardly any eyebrows , and no eyelashes , and eyes of a red-brown , so unsheltered and unshaded , that I remember wondering how he went to sleep . He was high-shouldered and bony ; dressed in decent black , with a white wisp of a neckcloth ; buttoned up to the throat ; and had a long , lank , skeleton hand , which particularly attracted my attention , as he stood at the pony 's head , rubbing his chin with it , and looking up at us in the chaise . Uriah has been employed as clerk to Wickfield for four years , since he was eleven . Uriah 's father , who instilled him with the need to be humble , died when Uriah was ten , and for the first part of the novel he lives alone with his mother in their `` umble abode '' . Copperfield takes an immediate and permanent dislike to Uriah , in spite of the latter 's persistent , if insincere attempts to win his friendship . Uriah addresses Copperfield as `` Master Copperfield '' well into their adulthood , an indication of his true patronising view . Uriah is repeatedly mentioned as ugly and repulsive , even in his youth - tall , lank and pale with red hair and lashless eyes . He may be albino , according to frequent mentions of his pale skin and red eyes , though this is never clearly stated . Dickens negatively emphasizes Uriah 's movements as well , described as jerking and writhing ; this leads some literary scholars to believe Dickens is describing a form of dystonia , a muscular disorder , to increase Uriah 's snakelike character . Uriah explains in another part of the book that his ambition and greed are fueled by resentment from the double-standard of his schooling and from his treatment as a child , and by encouragement from his parents . As Uriah works for Wickfield for the next five or so years , he teaches himself law at night , and by blackmailing Mr. Wickfield , gains control over his business . He eventually succeeds in having himself made a full partner in the business . His eventual ambition is to marry Agnes and gain control of the Wickfield fortune . Like most of Dickens ' villains , greed is his main motivation . Heep is eventually stymied by Mr. Micawber and Tommy Traddles , with help from David and Agnes . Once his fraud and treachery are unmasked , he persists in hounding Micawber and Copperfield . Towards the end of the novel , he is last seen in Mr. Creakleâ s prison where we find that he has returned to his `` umble '' ways , and puts himself forward as a model prisoner . He is said to be sentenced for transportation for life , which likely means he will eventually be sent to one of the penal colonies in Australia . Much of David Copperfield is autobiographical and some scholars believe Heep 's mannerisms and physical attributes to be based on Hans Christian Andersen whom Dickens met shortly before writing the novel . Uriah Heep 's schemes and behavior are more likely based on Thomas Powell , employer to a friend of Dickens , Thomas Chapman . Powell '' ... ingratiated himself into the Dickens household '' and was discovered to be a forger and a thief , having embezzled Â # 10,000 from his employer . He later attacked Dickens in pamphlets , calling particular attention to Dickens ' social class and background . Powell was later deemed a lunatic . The characteristics of grasping manipulation and insincerity can lead to a person being labeled `` a Uriah Heep '' as Lyndon Johnson is called in Robert Caro 's biography . Seymour Fleming , a character in the play Babes in Arms , is also called thus . Author Philip Roth once compared President Richard Nixon to Uriah Heep . In film and television adaptations , the character has been played by , amongst others , Roland Young ( 1935 ) , Colin Jeavons ( 1966 ) , Ron Moody ( 1970 ) , Martin Jarvis ( 1974 ) , Paul Brightwell ( 1986 ) , Nicholas Lyndhurst ( 1999 ) , Frank MacCusker ( 2000 ) and Simon Pegg ( 2009 ) . The British rock band Uriah Heep is named after the character .

The station is in Travelcard Zone 6 and is served by Lea Valley Lines services . The station is operated by National Express East Anglia as are all trains serving it . The railway line from Bury Street Junction , north of the current Edmonton Green station , to Cheshunt was opened by the Great Eastern Railway on October 1 , 1891 . It was known as the Churchbury Loop . The district served by the line was still predominantly rural , and the coming of the tram to Waltham Cross in 1904 saw the railway unable to compete . Passenger services ceased on October 1 , 1909 , but were reinstated for the benefit of munitions workers between March 1 , 1915 and July 1 , 1919 . After that the line was only served by freight trains until the line was electrified as part of a wider scheme , and Turkey Street station reopened to passengers on November 21 , 1960 . The line is now known as the Southbury Loop . The station was opened as Forty Hill railway station , and did not gain its current name until 1960 . The goods depot at the station closed in 1966 . The current station building was built in the early 1980s . The previous and original station building was notable due to a prominent tall chimney stack for the station masters coal fire which brought the top of the chimney above platform level . The station itself is constructed on an incline and the ticket office area of the track is raised on an embankment so the chimney was very prominent . the interior of the original station consisted of a large ticket hall with the station master 's office and serving hatch on the left hand side ( From the entrance ) . There was a tunnel in front of you leading to the stairs to the Cheshunt bound platform . This tunnel was used in the rebuild . To the right were the stairs to the Liverpool Street platform . The apertures that housed the stairs were also reused in the rebuild but the concrete steps were replaced with steel ones . The roof of the original station was triangular with a large chimney stack on top . It is also of interest to note that when originally built the station was on the other side of the railway bridge and a large width footbridge over Turkey Brook led directly to the Cheshunt bound platform . This entrance was dissused in the early 1970s onwards and the former station was converted to a newsagent and general store , the footbridge was used for storage for the shop and the entrance to the actual station area had a large iron gate but was bricked up when the station was rebuilt . The platforms themselves were of standard length and had large open fronted waiting areas of concrete walls and felt covered wooden roof with a long single bench along the rear wall . These were demolished when the station was rebuilt . In the 1980s the station was served by British Rail Class 305 EMUs going to and from London Liverpool Street and Cheshunt . Around the same time as the rebuild the 305s were slowly replaced by British Rail Class 315 . The Cheshunt service was extended to Hertford East in the late 1980s utilising the existing main line from Cheshunt to Broxbourne and the existing branch to Hertford East . The trains are often used by St Ignatius ' College and Lea Valley High School ( prev The Bullsmoor School ) pupils and is popular with commuters due to the amount of local parking . The typical off-peak service from the station is two trains per hour to Cheshunt , and two trains per hour to London Liverpool Street . London bus route 327 .

The Endeavour River ( Guugu Yimithirr : Wabalumbaal ) on Cape York Peninsula in Far North Queensland , Australia , was named in 1770 by Lt. James Cook , R.N. , after he was forced to beach his ship , HM Bark Endeavour , for repairs in the river mouth , after damaging it on a reef . Joseph Banks named it the `` Endeavours River , '' but the form Cook used , Endeavour River , has stuck . Cook and his crew remained for almost 7 weeks and made contact with the local Guugu Yimithirr Aborigines , while the naturalists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander made extensive collections of native flora , while Sydney Parkinson illustrated much of the flora and fauna of the region . Modern Cooktown ( population circa 2000 ) is located at the mouth of the Endeavour River . It is the northernmost town on the East coast of Australia , and was founded in 1873 , around the site of Cook 's landing , as a port to service the newly discovered Palmer River Goldfields . Some of the relatively undisturbed natural features near the mouth of the river have been reserved as a Queensland National Park , the Endeavour River National Park . In recent years , tilapia fish , which are considered a `` noxious species '' in Australia , have infested the river , causing concern that the stocks of native fish will suffer . See : Tilapia as exotic species .
Sea lions are pinnipeds characterized by external ear-flaps , long fore-flippers , the ability to walk on all fours , and short thick hair . Together with the fur seals , they comprise the family Otariidae , or eared seals . There are six extant and one extinct species ( the Japanese sea lion ) in five genera . Their range extends from the subarctic to tropical waters of the global ocean in both the northern and southern hemispheres with the notable exception of the northern Atlantic Ocean . Together with the fur seals , they constitute the Otariidae family , collectively known as eared seals . Until recently , sea lions were grouped under a single subfamily called Otariinae to distinguish them from the fur seals Arcocephalinae , based on the most prominent common feature between all species , namely the lack of the dense underfur characteristic of the latter . Recent genetic evidence , however , strongly suggests that Callorhinus , the genus of the Northern fur seal is more closely related to some sea lion species than to the other fur seal genus Arctocephalus . Therefore the fur seal\/sealion subfamily distinction has been eliminated from many taxonomies . Nonetheless , all fur seals have certain features in common : the fur , generally smaller sizes , farther and longer foraging trips , smaller and more abundant prey items and greater sexual dimorphism . And all sea lions have certain features in common , in particular their coarse , short fur , greater bulk and larger prey than fur seals . For these reasons , the distinction remains useful . Some species of sea lion are readily trainable and are often a popular attraction at zoos and aquariums . The archetypal circus `` seal '' performing behaviors such as throwing and catching balls on its nose and clapping is almost always a sea lion . Sea lions have been trained by the U.S. Navy 's Marine Mammal Program , based in San Diego , to detain scuba divers . Sea lion attacks on humans are rare . In a highly unusual attack in 2007 in Western Australia a sea lion leapt from the water and seriously mauled a 13-year old girl surfing behind a speedboat . The sea lion appeared to be preparing for a second attack when the girl was rescued . An Australian marine biologist opined the sea lion may have viewed the girl `` like a rag doll toy '' to be played with . In San Francisco where an increasingly large population of California sea lion crowds dock along San Francisco Bay , there have been incidents in recent years of swimmers being bitten on the leg by large aggressive males , possibly as a territorial act . The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped the sea and its animals . They often depicted sea lions in their art . Sea lions have also been reported to assist or save humans who show signs of distress in the open waters . In June of 2000 , Kevin Hines leaped into the San Francisco bay and it was reported that he was saved by a sea lion that kept him afloat and breathing till the paramedics arrived .
Prescott Observatory ( IAU code 684 ) is operated by Paul G. Comba . Prescott Observatory may also be the designation of a group of remotely-located assets of Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff , Arizona . The Lowell Observatory website includes a reference to equipment `` on Mars Hill '' at `` Prescott Observatory '' , but note that the Lowell Observatory address is on Mars Hill Road , Mars Hill Campus , so it may be this Prescott has nothing to do with the other . All of Lowell 's telescopes are apparently at the Anderson Mesa Observing Station . The historic Alvan Clark 24 i telescope is located on Mars Hill , Flagstaff . ... operated remotely so that the astronomers can run the telescopes and cameras from comfortable , climate controlled quarters , or remain outside to view the night sky . Although Edward Registrato 's Vision in Time Observatories are said to be located in Peoria , Arizona , and Dewey , Arizona , `` near Prescott '' . These have no IAU codes . Prescott , Arizona , located about 95 driving miles from Flagstaff , is one of the places Percival Lowell considered when seeking the ideal site in Arizona to establish a new observatory . The observatory in Flagstaff was founded in 1894 . Lowell did many Mars observations and drew maps of what he saw .
British Railways Class D16\/1 or 10000 and 10001 were the first mainline diesel locomotives in Great Britain . They were built by the London , Midland and Scottish Railway at its Derby Works , using the EE16SVT 1600 hp diesel engine with electric transmission , in association with English Electric and the Vulcan Foundry , with whom the LMS had had a long working relationship . LMS 10000 was officially presented to the press at Derby Works in December 1947 , having had its maiden run in November 1947 , after several weeks of proving trials entered service on the Midland route in February 1948 . 10000 was outshopped only two months before nationalisation , and when 10001 appeared in July 1948 it had British Railways livery . They operated over a number of routes out of St Pancras or Euston but their low power outputs meant they were less than inspiring when used on heavily loaded or express services . In March 1953 they were both transferred to the Southern Region of British Railways to allow direct comparison to be made between them and the SR 's 10201 , 10202 & 10203 and remained there until spring 1955 . They ( and the SR locomotives ) were sent to Derby where they were overhauled and received green livery and then ran side by side on London Midland Region duties . Trials of both types proved interesting , with the Southern Railway locomotives developing into the English Electric Type 4 design for British Railways ( later British Rail Class 40 ) . Both locos were allocated to Willesden . 10001 was withdrawn in 1966 and scrapped at Cox & Danks , North Acton , in February 1968 . 10000 was withdrawn in 1963 and scrapped at Cashmores , Great Bridge , in January 1968 .

The Western Bloc or Capitalist Bloc during the Cold War refers to the powers allied with the United States and NATO against the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact . The latter were referred to as the Eastern Bloc , a more common term in English than Western Bloc , because the governments and press of the Western Bloc were more inclined to refer to themselves as the `` Free World '' . At the end of World War II the United States and the Soviet Union emerged as the two superpowers . According to Matloff , â â the Second World War represented a fundamental shift in the international balance of power , for which a coalition strategy fashioned for victory provided no real or grand solutionsâ ( 702 ) . Most of Europe had been divided by Nazi occupation and these two superpowers were responsible for setting up new governments within these countries . It was agreed that free elections would ensue , however the Soviet Union did not keep their end of the deal . Soviet non-compliance with establishing free elections in war torn European countries eventually led to a strained relationship with the United States and severe tension . According to Kissinger , â Tension with the outside world was inherent in the very nature of communist philosophy and , above all , in the way the Soviet system was being run domestically . Thus the Soviet Unionâ s implacable hostility to the outside world was an attempt to gear international affairs to its own internal rhythmâ ( Kissinger 454 ) . Relations between the Soviet Union and the United States continued to be strained and â Truman perceived the emerging struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union as a contest between good and evil , not as having to do with spheres of political influenceâ ( Kissinger 447 ) . Soviet expansion in Eastern Europe prompted the United States and a few European countries to form NATO . NATO existed â to coordinate the military defenses of member nations against possible Soviet aggressionâ . The Warsaw pact was formed as a direct response to NATO . It existed to protect Soviet Satellite countries that were formed after World War II ; and to ensure that no enemy invaded any of the Soviet satellite countries . It also had the power to intervene militarily if any one of its countries tried to establish independence . Kissinger states : â Although the Soviet Union cemented its dominance over Eastern Europe by means of the Warsaw Pact , this nominal alliance was obviously being held together by coercionâ ( 447 ) . The Soviets â became concerned when the West actively pushed West Germany towards rearmament , to help balance the power of the Soviet Union . The fear of a strong German military on the borders of Soviet controlled countries prompted action . In 14 May 1955 , all nations under the control of the Soviet Union signed the Warsaw Pact agreement . â ( 1 ) http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/his135/Events/nato49/nato49.html ( 2 ) http://www.saskschools.ca/curr_content/history20/unit4/sec2_03.html Matloff , Maurice .

The Tour de France is a cycling stage race held since 1903 over a current period of three weeks , although it was not staged from 1914 to 1918 and from 1940 to 1946 , because of the First World War and Second World War respectively . The first winner was Frenchman Maurice Garin . Four of his fellow countrymen won the race during the next six years , before FranÃ ois Faber , from Luxembourg , became the first winner from outside France in 1909 . Frenchman Jacques Anquetil became the first person to win five tours , including four consecutive races from 1961 to 1964 . Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx in 1974 and Frenchman Bernard Hinault in 1985 also completed five victories . In 1986 , Hinault was denied a sixth victory by American Greg LeMond , who became the first winner from outside Europe . Three years later , LeMond recorded the narrowest margin of victory , when he beat Laurent Fignon by eight seconds . Spaniard Miguel Indurain became the first winner of five consecutive tours from 1991 to 1995 . His feat was surpassed by American Lance Armstrong , who recovered from testicular cancer to win seven consecutive tours between 1999 and 2005 . French cyclists have been the most successful in the event , having won 36 of the 94 tours , although their last champion was Bernard Hinault in 1985 . They are followed by Belgian riders , who have won 18 , including seven consecutive titles from 1912 to 1922 . Cyclists from Spain have won twelve events . Cyclists from United States have won ten events , all coming from LeMond and Armstrong . In total , cyclists from 11 countries have won the Tour de France . During the Tour 's history , its organisers have launched a series of other jerseys . In 1933 , the race 's best climbers were rewarded with the King of the Mountains competition , but it was not until 1975 that the leading rider in the classification wore the distinctive polka dot jersey . To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the race in 1953 , the green jersey competition was started . It rewarded the consistent finishers in individual stages by awarding points depending on the place in the stage . In 1975 , the Tour organisers launched an award for the leading young cyclist , awarding a white jersey to the leading cyclist under 26 years of age in the general classification . Eddy Merckx in 1969 is the only rider to win the King of the Mountains , the points and the overall title in the same year . A. : Bjarne Riis has admitted doping during the 1996 Tour de France . The organisers of the Tour de France have stated they no longer consider him to be the winner , although the ASO still lists Riis as the winner on the Tour 's official website . Jan Ullrich was placed second on the podium in Paris . B. : Floyd Landis was the winner at the podium ceremony in Paris on the last day of the 2006 tour , but subsequently was found to have tested positive for performance enhancing drugs during stage 17 of the race . The United States Anti-Doping Agency found him guilty of using synthetic testosterone during the race and stripped him of his title on September 20 , 2007 .
The 100 Books of the Century is a grading of the books considered as the hundred best of the 20th century , drawn up in the spring of 1999 through a poll conducted by the French retailer Fnac and the Paris newspaper Le Monde . Starting from a preliminary list of 200 titles created by bookshops and journalists , 17,000 French voted by responding to the question , `` Which books have stayed in your memory ? '' ( Â `` Quels livres sont restÃ s dans votre mÃ moire ? Â '' ) . The list of acclaimed titles mixes great novels with poetry and theater , as well as the comic strip . The first fifty works on the list were the subject of an essay by FrÃ dÃ ric Beigbeder , The Last Inventory Before Liquidation , in which he notably drew attention to its French-centred character . Note : Language and Country refer to the author 's career generally , not to the book specifically .

The Swiss Grand Prix ( French : Grand Prix de la Suisse , German : GroÃ er Preis von der Schweiz ) was the premier auto race of Switzerland . In its later years it was a Formula One race . Grand Prix motor racing came to Switzerland in 1934 , to the Bremgarten circuit , located just outside the town of Bremgarten , near Bern . The Swiss Grand Prix counted toward the European Championship from 1935 to 1939 . The Bremgarten track remained the home of the Swiss Grand Prix until 1954 and in 1948 it was designated the European Grand Prix , in a time when this title was an honorary designation given each year to one grand prix race in Europe . Any chance to return was erased in 1958 when motor racing was banned by the Swiss government as an unsafe spectator sport following the death of 80 people at the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans race . The Swiss Grand Prix returned in 1975 as a non-Championship Grand Prix just across the border , at the Dijon-Prenois circuit , France . The next , and last , Swiss Grand Prix was a round of the Formula One World Championship in , also held at Dijon . On June 6 , 2007 Swiss Parliament voted to lift the ban of circuit racing in Switzerland , 97 in favor and 77 opposed . However , the legislation was subsequently not ratified by the Swiss Council of States ( the Senat ) and the ban is now highly unlikely to actually be lifted . Events which were not part of the Formula One World Championship are indicated by a pink background . A cream background indicates an event which was part of the pre-war European Championship .
A soldier is a member of the land component of national armed forces ; whereas a soldier hired for service in a foreign army would be termed a mercenary . The majority of cognates of the word `` soldier '' that exist in other languages have a meaning that embraces both commissioned and non-commissioned officers in national land forces . The word soldier entered modern English in the 14th century , from the equivalent Middle English word soudeor , from Anglo-French soudeer or soudeor , meaning mercenary , from soudee , meaning shilling 's worth or wage , from sou or soud , shilling . The word is also related to the Medieval Latin soldarius , meaning soldier ( literally , `` one having pay '' ) . These words were ultimately derived from the Late Latin word solidus , referring to an Ancient Roman coin used in the Byzantine Empire . In most armed forces use of the word soldier has taken on a more general meaning , due to the increasing specialization of military occupations that require different areas of knowledge and skill-sets . As a result , `` soldiers '' are referred to by names or ranks which reflect an individual 's military occupation specialty Arm , Service or Branch of military employment , their type of unit , or operational employment or technical use such as : trooper , tanker , Commando , dragoon , infantryman , Marine , paratrooper , ranger , sniper , engineer , sapper , medic , or a gunner . In many countries soldiers serving in specific occupations are referred to by terms other than their occupational name . For example military police personnel in the U.K. are known as `` redcaps '' from the color of their berets or other headwear . In the United States Army and the United States Marine Corps , infantrymen are called `` grunts , '' while artillerymen are sometimes referred to as `` redlegs , '' from the branch color for artillery . U.S. soldiers are often called `` G.I. s '' . French Marine Infantry are called marsouins ( porpoises ) because of their amphibious role . Military units in most armies have nicknames of this type , arising either from items of distinctive uniform , some historical connotation or rivalry between branches or regiments . For example , U.S. Marines are sometimes called jar-heads because of their `` high and tight '' haircuts and the way they wear their hats makes their heads look like the cap of a jar or decanter .

On June 4 , 2008 , Cleary became the first player from Newfoundland and Labrador to get his name on the Stanley Cup when the Red Wings won hockey 's top prize . He was selected in the first round of the 1997 NHL Entry Draft , 13th overall , by the Chicago Blackhawks . A common mistake made by announcers during NHL games is saying Cleary is from Carbonear , Newfoundland . Cleary was born in Carbonear , as this was\/is the location of the area 's only hospital , but he was raised in a nearby town called Harbour Grace , in a section of the town called Riverhead . After playing minor hockey in his home area of Harbour Grace , Cleary left home at age 15 to play for the Kingston ( ON ) Voyageurs of the Metro Junior Hockey League ( OHA ) . He scored 46 points in 41 games with the V 's that season and subsequently was selected 11th overall in the 1994 OHL Priority Selection by the Belleville Bulls . Cleary had a phenomenal junior career with the Belleville Bulls of the OHL which begun by scoring a hat trick in his very first game as an underage 16 year old . Ironically , Cleary scored that hat trick against the Guelph Storm and current Red Wings teammate , Todd Bertuzzi in September of 1994 . Although his performance tailed off in his draft year , Chicago still selected him midway through the first round . Just one year removed from junior , Cleary was dealt to the Edmonton Oilers as part of a package that landed Boris Mironov in Chicago . Cleary played parts of four seasons in Edmonton . Cleary 's $ 1 million contract was bought out by the Oilers in the summer of 2003 . Shortly thereafter , he was signed to a much cheaper contract by the Phoenix Coyotes . He played , together with his former Edmonton teammate and friend Shawn Horcoff , for Mora IK of Elitserien during the 2004 â `` 05 NHL lockout . Following the lockout , Phoenix did not offer Cleary a qualifying contract . Cleary was invited to the Detroit Red Wings training camp , making the team out of camp and signing to a one-year contract with the Red Wings on October 4 , 2005 . In the 2005 â `` 06 season , Cleary established himself as a dependable role player as a defensive forward . In the 2006 â `` 07 season given an expanded role with the Wings , Cleary scored a career high 20 goals in 71 games . During the 2006 â `` 07 NHL playoff quarterfinals against Calgary , Cleary successfully converted a penalty shot while shorthanded ; this was the first time it had been done in Detroit during the playoffs . In the 2007 â `` 08 season , Cleary repeated the accomplishment of scoring 20 goals in the regular season . On February 9 , 2008 , Cleary suffered a broken jaw which forced him to miss 19 games . On March 11 , 2008 , Cleary signed a 5 year contract extension with the Detroit Red Wings , worth $ 14 million . On June 4 , 2008 , Cleary won the Stanley Cup with the Detroit Red Wings as they beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 4 games to 2 in the Stanley Cup finals , becoming the first Newfoundlander to do so . On June 30 , 2008 , Cleary brought the Stanley Cup home to Newfoundland . A packed lobby welcomed Cleary at the St. John 's International Airport . Later that day , Cleary brought the Cup to the Janeway Children 's Hospital . On July 1 , 2008 , Cleary brought the Stanley Cup back to his hometown Harbour Grace , Newfoundland for a Canada Day celebration that included a parade and a concert . The event attracted an estimated 27,000 people . The event also attracted an estimated 103 individual media accreditations with media from across Canada and the United States landing in Harbour Grace to cover Dan Cleary 's story . The Newfoundland bluegrass\/folk band Greeley 's Reel ( http://www.greeleysreel.com ) recorded a `` hockey anthem '' version of their song `` Come In '' about Cleary after the win . The refrain specifically highlights the celebration that would occur `` when Danny Cleary brings the Stanley Cup to Newfoundland . '' In addition to receiving extensive local radio airplay , the song appeared on CBC Television and a Fox Sports Detroit special . In the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs on May 14 , 2009 , Cleary scored the tie breaking , Western Conference semi-final series winning goal for the Detroit Red Wings against the Anaheim Ducks with 3 minutes left in Game 7 . With the win the Red Wings moved on to face the Chicago Blackhawks in the Western Conference Final . Cleary scored 5 goals against his former team in a 4-1 series win clinching the Western Conference title before succumbing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 7 games in a rematch of the previous Stanley Cup finals .

The Cross-City Line is a suburban railway line in the West Midlands region of England . It runs from Redditch , Worcestershire , its southern terminus , to Lichfield , Staffordshire , its northern terminus , via Birmingham New Street , and services on the line are currently operated by London Midland . The Â # 7.4 million Cross City line was sanctioned in May 1975 and launched on 8 May 1978 . Services initially ran between Longbridge and Four Oaks via Birmingham New Street and the project was a creation of the West Midland Passenger Transport Executive ( WMPTE . It is formed out of the former Midland Railway 's Birmingham West Suburban Railway between Redditch and Birmingham via Selly Oak , and the London and North Western Railway Line between Birmingham and Lichfield . On opening in 1978 it included the re-opening of Five Ways station and a new station to serve the University of Birmingham ; and one at Longbridge ( the original station at Longridge was on the branch line to Halesowen and Old Hill ) many of the other stations were rebuilt at the same time . Of the new stations the only one to be officially opened was the one at University where the then Secretary of State for Transport William Rodgers MP formally opened the station on the 8th May 1978 . There is a plaque on platform 2 marking this occasion . The route was electrified in the early 1990s , beginning in 1991 and completed on the 6 June 1993 . The decision to electrify was made on 7 February 1990 by the then Transport Minister Cecil Parkinson coincidentally during the campaign for a by-election in the Lichfield constituency . Redditch , Alvechurch , Aston and Blake Street stations were rebuilt at this time . A number of other stations including Barnt Green Station were extensively modified to accommodate the new longer electric trains . The cities , towns and villages served by the line are listed below . For many years , passenger services on the line were worked by elderly Class 108 , 115 , 116 , 117 , 118 and 121 diesel multiple units . However , by the early 1990s these trains were becoming increasingly unreliable , so new trains were built to coincide with the electrification of the route in 1993 . By 1995 the last of the old trains had been withdrawn , having been replaced by the current Class 323 electrical multiple units . Services are currently operated by London Midland on behalf of Centro . There are long-standing proposals for improvements to the line . Extra stations have been proposed for Mere Green ( between Four Oaks and Butler 's Lane ) and Wychall ( between Northfield and King 's Norton ) . More ambitious plans include the re-opening of a short spur south of Longbridge to Rubery and Frankley and the re-introduction of local trains on the Camp Hill Line ( effectively a loop between Birmingham New Street and King 's Norton ) . Bromsgrove station will be added as an alternative southern terminus for the route when the existing electrification is extended there from Barnt Green . There are also plans for the introduction of a passing loop at Alvechurch to allow 3 trains per hour to Redditch . Currently , the line is single-track between Barnt Green and Redditch and so it is impossible to have more than 2 trains per hour . If services are delayed , then the trains may miss out stations between Birmingham New Street and Longbridge to make up time , or the service may be curtailed at Barnt Green to prevent a knock-on effect to other services . Nevertheless , the line 's main problem is capacity on its central section . The long term aspiration is for dedicated tunnels through central Birmingham : this would either take the form of new bored tunnels ( favored by the SRA ) or a re-opening of Birmingham Curzon Street Station to allow two of the existing four tunnels to be used for local trains only ( formerly favored by Central Trains ) . With the current funding problems on Britain 's railways , it is unlikely that the Cross-City Line will see any improvement . Over the 2010 Christmas period , the line between Selly Oak and the University will be closed for three days to allow the installation of a new railway bridge over the Selly Oak relief road which is currently under construction .

Metallica ( also known as The Black Album ) is the eponymous fifth studio album by the American heavy metal band Metallica . It was released on August 13 , 1991 through Elektra Records . Metallica produced five hit singles that are considered today among the band 's best-known songs : `` Enter Sandman '' , `` The Unforgiven '' , `` Nothing Else Matters '' , `` Wherever I May Roam '' , and `` Sad but True '' . It spent four consecutive weeks at number one on Billboard 200 . Metallica is the band 's best-selling album to date , with over 15 million copies sold in the United States . It is the best-selling album of the SoundScan era . The album was certified 15x platinum ( diamond ) by the RIAA on November 13 , 2009 . Metallica was a departure from the thrash metal style of Metallica 's previous four albums and saw the band moving towards a more commercial heavy metal sound . Many fans consider the album the initial turning point in their music , where `` old '' and `` new '' Metallica are distinguished from one another . The album cover features the band 's logo , angled against the upper left corner , and a coiled snake ( derived from the Gadsden flag ) on the bottom right corner , both in a dark shade of gray in order to be made out against the black background . The motto of the Gadsden flag , `` Do n't Tread on Me '' , is also the title of a song on the album . The cover is reminiscent of Spinal Tap 's album Smell the Glove , something the band jokingly acknowledged themselves in their A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica documentary ( where members of Spinal Tap appeared and asked them about it ) . The album and the band were critically acclaimed and commercially successful . The band changed their sound from previous albums . Metallica presented a more commercially accessible Metallica . Following the success of `` One '' , the breakaway single from their fourth album ... And Justice for All ( 1988 ) , five music videos were released from Metallica : `` Enter Sandman '' , `` Nothing Else Matters '' , `` Sad but True '' , `` Wherever I May Roam '' and `` The Unforgiven '' . The lyrics of Metallica , written by James Hetfield , were more personal and introspective in nature than previous Metallica albums . `` The God That Failed '' dealt with Hetfield 's mother 's death from cancer and her Christian Science beliefs which kept her from seeking medical treatment . Another example is `` Nothing Else Matters '' , which was a love song Hetfield wrote about missing his girlfriend while on tours . Metallica was produced by Bob Rock , who was asked to mix the album as the band was impressed with his work as producer on the MÃ tley CrÃ 1\/4 e album , Dr. Feelgood . Initially , the band was not interested in having Rock produce their album , but changed their minds as Ulrich stated `` We felt that we still had our best record in us and Bob Rock could help us make it . '' Rock altered the band 's working schedule and routine so much that they swore never to work with him again . The animosity and tension between Metallica and Rock was documented in the documentaries A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica and Classic Albums : Metallica â `` Metallica . Both explore and document the intense recording process that resulted in Metallica . Despite the controversies between the band and Rock , he continued to work with the band through the 2003 album St. Anger . Metallica DVD-Audio 5.1 mix was released in 2001 through Elektra Records . The world tour following the album ( initially dubbed the `` Wherever We May Roam Tour '' and then later the `` Nowhere Else to Roam Tour '' ) , saw Metallica on the road for the next three years . The tour was in part documented in the A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica documentary , as well as the 3-CD , 2-DVD ( or 3-VHS ) boxset Live Shit : Binge & Purge . Some songs , such as `` Enter Sandman '' , `` Nothing Else Matters '' and `` Sad but True '' would become permanent staples of the band 's concert setlists during these and subsequent tours . Other songs though , such as `` Holier Than Thou '' , `` The God That Failed '' and `` Through the Never '' , by 1995 , were no longer a part of any performances and would not be played again until more recent years when the band , with Robert Trujillo on bass , began performing a more extensive back catalog of songs .
Saint-Victoret is a commune in the Bouches-du-Rh Ã ne department in the Provence-Alpes-C Ã te d'Azur region in southern France . It is located northwest of Marseille . Saint-Victoret is a small market town situated just next to Marignane , not far from the airport and just a few kilometres from the eastern shore of the Ã tang de Berre . If you take the secondary road D20 to Saint-Victoret , you first pass through the hamlet of Pas-des-Lanciers . Here you will find a small , lively district with a few shops and an SNCF railway station for the transport of goods and freight to the airport . In the roads parallel to the D20 there are some pretty little villas which were built before the airport . Two kilometres beyond Pas-des-Lanciers you will come to the center of Saint Victoret . With its new housing blocks , roundabouts planted with flowers , a media library and a cultural center , the heart of the village is well laid out and pleasantly floral . You may feel as though you have arrived in the new village of Saint Victoret , since everything looks so recent . Nevertheless , the village makes the most of what historic heritage there is , with several chapels , churches and pretty fountains . The history and life of Saint-Victoret are closely linked with the activities of the airport in every respect . There is one Saint-Victoret before the airport and another after the airport ... the proximity of the airport has enormous repercussions for the village . First and foremost is obviously the incessant noise of aeroplanes landing at the airport . How bearable the noise is depends on which district of Saint-Victoret you are in ( some districts lie directly beneath the flight path to the landing strip ) . In terms of employment , real estate and , above all , the revival of the local economy , the airport has certainly had a very real impact on Saint-Victoret ... both in a positive and a negative sense . In terms of tourism , large numbers of visitors see Saint Victoret ... but only from the air !
The Black-breasted Puffleg ( Eriocnemis nigrivestis ) is an average sized ( 8.5 cm in length ) species of hummingbird endemic to Ecuador . It has a very restricted range , being found only on the Northwestern slopes of the Pichincha volcano and it is critically endangered . On the 23rd of June , 2005 this bird was adopted as the emblem of the city of Quito , which , being just on the other side of the volcano , is very close to where the last populations of the species are found .
He spent only one year in Liga I , however , canceling his contract in the summer and returning to his country , signing with second division 's SD Huesca . Trelleborgs FF , or simply Trelleborg , is a Swedish football club located in Trelleborg . The club , formed 6 December 1926 , is ( at 2010 ) playing in the highest Swedish league , Allsvenskan . Trelleborgs FF has participated 14 times in Allsvenskan and once in the UEFA-cup where the team eliminated Blackburn Rovers in the same season Rovers won the English Premier League . Trelleborg have had a reputation of being a less fashionable provincial side , making the most of limited resources and a small fan base . The club 's glory days arrived in the early nineties when they won promotion to Allsvenskan for the second time and finished third in 1992 , the so far best placement , and fourth in 1993 . Tipped for demotion at the start of most seasons , the team scrambled through the late nineties with effective , but not very attractive , defensive long ball tactics . Trelleborg 's stadium , VÃ ngavallen , was even called `` Tjongavallen '' ( from Swedish `` Tjonga '' - kicking a football far away without direction ) . The team was demoted in 2001 , finishing last after a disappointing season . During their third spell in Allsvenskan the demotion was somewhat ironic since it came after the Trelleborg board hired the dane Ole MÃ rk who was supposed to change the Trelleborg style of play into a more attractive short-passing game . The club is affiliated to the SkÃ nes FotbollfÃ rbund . In 2004 the team finished last in Allsvenskan and was demoted to Superettan . In 2005 , TFF finished eleventh in Superettan after a turbulent year , while 2006 became a successful year for the team . Three rounds before the end of Superettan 2006 , Trelleborg stood as clear winners , thus gaining promotion to the 2007 Allsvenskan . Relegation was narrowly avoided with superior goal difference in 2007 . In 2008 Tom Prahl , trainer during the success years in the early nineties , returned as head coach . Trelleborg finished at tenth place in an even season where Rasmus Bengtsson amongst others had an inspiring season . In 2009 the team finished at ninth place after a strong finish . This year the team finished their best position since 1993 when they finished fifth after a strong autumn . In 2010 the teams tactics changed to a more creative and public friendly gamestyle .

A sickle is a hand-held agricultural tool with a curved blade typically used for harvesting grain crop or cutting grass for hay . The inside of the curve is sharp , so that the user can draw or swing the blade against the base of the crop , catching it in the curve and slicing it at the same time . The material to be cut may be held in a bunch in the other hand ( for example when reaping ) , held in place by a wooden stick , or left free . When held in a bunch , the sickle action is towards the user ( left to right for a right-handed user ) , but when used free the sickle is usually swung the opposite way . Different types may be referred to as a grasshook , swap hook , rip-hook , slash-hook , reaping hook , brishing hook or bagging hook . The blade of a sickle is often cranked to one side , to make it easier to keep the blade closer to the ground ; this makes it right - or ( more rarely ) left-handed . Sickles used for reaping are usually serrated . The sickle was largely superseded by the scythe , which is a more efficient tool in use for many purposes , as it continues to be in use in many parts of the world . The most noticeable difference between a sickle and a scythe is the length of the handle : a sickle is a one-handed tool with a short handle , used while bending down to the ground , while a scythe is a two-handed tool , used standing up , with a long , often curved shaft , and a much longer blade . A blade which is used regularly to cut the silica-rich stems of cereal crops acquires a characteristic sickle-gloss , or wear pattern . It was a critical tool that was used to facilitate early agriculture . The sickle has been discovered in Southwest America with a unique structure . These sickles are said to possibly have originated from the Far East . There is evidence that Kodiak islanders had for cutting grass â sickles made of a sharpened animal shoulder bladeâ . The artifacts found in present day Arizona and New Mexico resemble curved tools that were made from the horns of mountain sheep . A similar site discovered sickles made from other material such as the Caddo Sickle , which was made from a deer mandible . Scripture from early natives document the use of these sickles in the cutting of grass . The instruments ranged from 13 to 16 inches tip to tip . Several other digs in eastern Arizona uncovered wooden sickles that were shaped in a similar fashion . The handles of the tools help describe how the tool was held in such a way so that the inner portion that contained the cutting surface could also serve as a gathering surface for the grain . Sickles were sharpened by scraping a shape beveled edge with a coarse tool . This action has left marks on artifacts that have been found . The sharpening process was necessary to keep the cutting edge from being dulled after extended use . The edge is seen to be quite highly polished , which in part proves that the instrument was used to cut grass . After collection , the grass was used as material to create matting and bedding . The sickle in general provided the convenience of cutting the grass as well as gathering in one step . In South America , the sickle was used as a tool to harvest rice . Rice clusters were harvested using the instrument and left to dry in the sun . The development of the sickle in Mesopotamia can be traced back to times that pre-date the Neolithic Era . Large quantities of sickle blades have been excavated in sites surrounding Palestine that have been dated to the â Epi-Palaeolithic â ( 18,000-8 ,000 B.C. ) era . Formal digs in Wadi Ziqlab , Jordan have unearthed various forms of early sickle blades . The artifacts recovered ranged from 1 to 2 cm in length and possessed a jagged edge . This intricate â tooth-like â design showed a greater degree of design and manufacturing credence than most of the other artifacts that were discovered . Sickle blades found during this time were made of flint , straight and used in more of a sawing motion than with the more modern curved design . Flints from these sickles have been discovered near Mt. Carmel , which suggest the harvesting of grains from the area about 10,000 years ago . The sickle had a profound impact on the Agricultural Revolution by assisting in the transition to farming and crop based lifestyle . It is now accepted that the use of sickles led directly to the domestication of Near Eastern Wild grasses . Research on domestication rates of wild cereals under primitive cultivation found that the use of the sickle in harvesting was critical to the people of early Mesopotamia . The relatively narrow growing season in the area and the critical role of grain in the late Neolithic Era promoted a larger investment in the design and manufacture of sickle over other tools . Standardization to an extent was done on the measurements of the sickle so that replacement or repair could be more immediate . It was important that the grain be harvested at the appropriate time at one elevation so that the next elevation could be collected in the proper time . The sickle provided a more efficient process in collecting the grain which facilitated the competence of the entire farming procedure .

Since 1996 , only one other Major League player with more than 250 at bats 80 games into the season has had a lower batting average : Greg Vaughn , .163 for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 2002 . Lugo 's performance was at such a low point , columnist Tom K. Elitch coined the phrase `` Lugo for 4 '' , inspiring fans to adopt it as a nickname for him . After the first week of July 2007 , Lugo turned his hitting performance around , compiling a 14-game hitting streak on July 25 , 2007 . He was 24-for-54 ( .444 ) during the career-best streak , raising his average from .189 to .226 .

Upon his return , Lugo got off to a slow start and was on a day-to-day playing rotation with fellow shortstop Nick Green . On July 17 , 2009 , Lugo was designated for assignment by the Boston Red Sox , and was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Chris Duncan and cash considerations along with a player-to-be-named-later , or cash on July 22 , 2009 . On April 1 , 2010 , Lugo was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for a player-to-be-named-later . He batted .249 in 241 at-bats , playing in 93 games . Lugo and his wife Mabely have two sons : Josmael Aquiles and Julio Alejandro . The family splits the offseason between homes in Houston and the Dominican Republic .

Leuven ( Dutch , pronounced ; , often used in English , ) is the capital of the province of Flemish Brabant in the Flemish Region , Belgium . It is located about 30 kilometers east of Brussels , with as other neighbouring cities Mechelen , Aarschot , Tienen , and Wavre . The township comprises the historical city of Leuven and the former municipalities of Heverlee , Kessel-Lo , a part of Korbeek-Lo , Wilsele and Wijgmaal . It is home to Anheuser-Busch InBev , the world 's largest brewer group and one of the top five largest consumer goods companies in the world ; and to the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven , the largest and oldest university of the Low Countries and the oldest Catholic university still in existence . The earliest mention of Leuven ( `` Loven '' ) is from 891 when a Viking army was defeated by the Frankish king Arnulf of Carinthia ( see : Battle of Leuven ) . According to the city legend , its red-white-red colors depict the blood-stained shores of the river Dijle after this battle . Situated at this river and nearby the stronghold of the Dukes of Brabant , Leuven became the most important center of trade in the duchy between the 11th and the 14th century . A token of its former importance as a center of cloth manufacture , is nicely reflected in the typical Leuven linen cloth , known in late 14-15th century texts as lewyn ( other spellings : Leuwyn , Levyne , Lewan ( e ) , Lovanium , Louvain ) . In the 15th century a new golden era began with the founding of the by now largest and oldest university in the Low Countries , the Catholic University of Leuven , in 1425 . In the 18th century Leuven became even more important as a result of the flourishing of the brewery now named AB InBev , and whose flagship beer , Stella Artois , is brewed in Leuven . In the 20th century , both world wars inflicted major damage to the city . Upon German entry in World War I , the town was heavily damaged due to German Schrecklichkeit policy . The Germans shot the burgomaster , university rector and all the city 's police officers . The university library was deliberately destroyed by the German army on August 25 1914 , using petrol and incendiary pastilles . Hundreds of thousands of irreplaceable volumes and Gothic and Renaissance manuscripts were lost . The world was outraged over this and the library was completely rebuilt after World War I with American charity funds and German war indemnities . After World War II , the burnt down building had to be restored again . It still stands as a symbol of the wars and of Allied solidarity . Given the presence of the KULeuven , an important European institution for academic research and education , much of the local economy is concentrated on spin-offs from academic research . There are several biotech and ICT companies ; Gasthuisberg , the academic hospital and research center and a large number of private service providers in the medical and legal field . Being the capital of the region of Flemish-Brabant means that there are many governmental institutions located in Leuven as well as the regional headquarters of transport corporations such as De Lijn . As the largest and one of the oldest cities in the immediate Flemish vicinity Leuven , with a large palate of cafÃ s , restaurants , cultural institutions and shopping neighborhoods , the city also attracts people from nearby cities and villages . Leuven is also the worldwide headquarters of Anheuser-Busch InBev , the largest beer company on the planet . In fact , InBev 's Stella Artois brewery and main offices dominate the entire north-eastern part of the town , between the railway station and the canal to Mechelen . Nowadays Leuven is a real `` student city '' , as during the academic year most citizens in its center are students . Leuven sports one of the liveliest bar scenes in Belgium . Besides boasting the `` longest bar '' in Belgium , the Old Market , dozens of bars and cafÃ s crammed into a central square in Leuven , it 's also the proud home city of Belgium 's smallest bar , Onder den Toog in the Noormannenstraat . The Katholieke Universiteit Leuven ( K.U. Leuven ; Catholic University of Leuven ) is the oldest Catholic university still in existence in the world and the biggest university in Belgium . There are also a number of hogescholen ( Vocational university , literally translated : `` high schools '' ) such as the Katholieke Hogeschool Leuven ( KHLeuven ; the Catholic High School Leuven ) , as well as a university college : Groep T ( Group T ) . The mayor of Leuven is currently Louis Tobback , a socialist politician prominent on the national level , formerly minister of internal affairs and leader of the socialist faction in the lower chamber of the Belgian parliament , among other positions held . One of Belgium 's finest conservatories is based in Leuven : the Lemmens Institute , which is described as `` Faculty of Music , Performing Arts and Education '' . It is known for its Music Therapy Education and its Wordart-Drama Education . Leuven is well known for its summer rock festival Marktrock . The main football club of the municipality is Oud-Heverlee Leuven , the successor of K. Stade Leuven . Leuven also has some orchestras , like the famous Arenberg Orchestra ( Dutch ) . Leuven is mentioned in the song `` Dirty Blue '' by Woven Hand , a lyric that mentions `` the bells of Leuven '' .
The Phasianidae is a family of birds which consists of the pheasants and partridges , including the junglefowl ( including chicken ) , Old World quail , francolins , monals and peafowl . The family is a large one , containing 38 genera and around 138 species . The family is occasionally broken up into two subfamilies , the Phasianinae , which holds 49 species of pheasant , and the Perdicinae , which holds the 106 remaining species . Sometimes additional families and birds are treated as being in this family as well ; the American Ornithologists ' Union includes Tetraonidae ( the grouse ) , Numididae ( guineafowls ) , and Meleagrididae ( turkeys ) in Phasianidae as subfamilies . The pheasants and their allies are an Old World family , with a distribution that includes most of Europe and Asia ( except the far north ) , all of Africa except the driest deserts and down into much of eastern Australia and ( formerly ) New Zealand . The greatest diversity of species is in Southeast Asia and Africa . Amongst the pheasants , with the exception of the Congo Peafowl , the distribution is entirely restricted to Asia ; the Perdicinae have a much more widespread distribution . Within their range they occupy almost every available habitat except for boreal forest and tundra . The family is generally sedentary and resident , although some quails undertake long migrations . Several species in the family have been widely introduced around the world , particularly pheasants which have been introduced to Europe , Australia and the Americas . Captive populations of peacocks and chickens have also escaped and become feral . Phasianids are terrestrial , ground living species . They are variable in size and ranging from 43 g , in the case of the Asian Blue Quail , to 6 kg in the case of the Indian Peafowl . There is generally sexual dimorphism in size , with males tending to be larger than females . They are generally plump , with broad relatively short wings and strong legs . Many have a spur on their legs , a feature shared with guineafowl and turkeys but no other galliform birds . The bill is short and generally strong , particularly in species that dig in order to obtain food . Males of the larger species often have brightly colored plumage as well as facial ornamentations such as wattles or crests . The pheasants and partridges have a varied diet , with foods taken ranging from purely vegetarian diets of seeds , leaves , fruits , tubers and roots , to small animals including insects , insect grubs and even small reptiles . Most species either specialise in feeding on plant matter or are predatory , although the chicks of most species are insectivorous . In addition to the variation in diet there is a considerable amount of variation in breeding strategies amongst the Phasianidae . Compared to birds in general there is a large number of species that do not engage in monogamy ( the typical breeding system of most birds ) . The francolins of Africa and some partridges are reportedly monogamous , but polygamy has been reported in the pheasants and junglefowl , some quail , and the breeding displays of peacocks have been compared to those of a lek . Nesting usually occurs on the ground ; only the tragopans nest higher up in stumps of bushes . Nests can vary from monds of vegetation to slight scrapes in the ground . As many as 18 eggs can be laid in the nest , although 7-12 is the more usual number , with smaller numbers in tropical species . Incubation is almost always performed by the female only , and last from 14 â `` 30 days depending on the species . Several species of pheasant and partridge are extremely important to humans . The Red Junglefowl of Southeast Asia is the wild ancestor of the domesticated chicken , the most important bird in agriculture . Ring-necked Pheasants , several partridge and quail species and some francolins have been widely introduced and managed as game birds for hunting . Several species are threatened by human activities .

Helmut Rahn , known as Der Boss ( The Boss ) , ( 16 August 1929 in Essen â `` 14 August 2003 ) was a German football player . He became a legend for having scored the winning goal in the final game of the 1954 FIFA World Cup ( West Germany 3 - Hungary 2 ) . Helmut Rahn started his career with Altenessen 1912 where he played from 1938 until 1946 . Then he went to SC Oelde 1919 with a total score of 52 goals for that team . In the 1950 â `` 51 season he played for Sportfreunde Katernberg . He was most successful when he played for Rot-Weiss Essen from 1951 â `` 1959 . The team won the DFB-Pokal final in 1953 and won the German Championship in 1955 . For one year , from 1959 till 1960 he had played at 1 . FC KÃ ln , 1960 he went to Sportclub Enschede in the Netherlands . In the Bundesliga 1963 he started playing for MSV Duisburg . He finished his career in 1965 because of a knee problem and , along with Hans SchÃ fer was one of the last members of the 1954 World Cup winning side to retire . His position was that of an outside right . His legend in German football was sparked by the heroic achievement of the German team in the final of the 1954 World Cup . Germany , whose team members themselves were surprised to be in the final , was playing Hungary , who had n't lost a single match for four years running up to the World Cup final . Germany lagged behind 0-2 after only 8 minutes , but then pulled it back to 2-2 with Rahn assisting the first German goal and scoring the second . With not long to go , Rahn received the ball just outside the penalty box before going past a Hungarian player and managing to shoot at the lower left corner with his weaker left foot just before being tackled . The ball whistled into the back of the net and Germany went on to win the game 3-2 over the apparently unbeatable Hungarian team . This match is known in Germany as The Miracle of Bern ( Das Wunder von Bern ) because of its `` David versus Goliath '' - like setting , and it is generally seen as an instrumental part of the rebuilding of the German people 's morale after the World War II . Rahn was also part of the German team that reached semifinals at the 1958 World Cup . With his goal against Yugoslavia , he became at the time the third maximum scorer in World Cups , with 10 total goals ( behind Just Fontaine and SÃ ndor Kocsis ) , and also the first player ever to score at least 4 goals in two different World Cups . Rahn played 40 international matches and scored a total of 21 goals . He was known as `` The Boss '' because of his on-field leadership and occasionally also as `` The Cannon from Essen '' . After retiring from football , Helmut Rahn started his own car dealership in Essen-Altenessen , along Altenessener Street . He was known for his good sense of humor and his joy and ability at talking with others . Many stories about him still circulate throughout Essen . One such story involves a discussion he once had with a friend regarding his car dealership : Helmut Rahn was once asked by a friend , how his car dealership worked . His very direct answer : `` I buy a car for 1,000 DM and sell it for 4,000 DM . And I live off of the three percent profit . '' He died two days shy of his 74th birthday , in Essen . The Movie `` Das Wunder von Bern '' was dedicated to him by director SÃ nke Wortmann . On 11 July 2004 , 50 years after the Bern match , a lifesize statue of him was put up near Georg-Melches-Stadium in Essen , on the square named after him .

A tehsil ( tahsil , tahasil ) ; also known as taluk ( taluq , taluka ) , and mandal , is an administrative division of some countries of South Asia . Generally , a tehsil consists of a city or town that serves as its headquarters , possibly additional towns , and a number of villages . As an entity of local government , it exercises certain fiscal and administrative power over the villages and municipalities within its jurisdiction . It is the ultimate executive agency for land records and related administrative matters . Its chief official is called the tehsildar or less officially the talukdar or taluka muktiarkar . Tehsil and taluka and their variants are used as English words without further translation . Since these terms are unfamiliar to English speakers outside of the subcontinent , the word county has sometimes been provided as a gloss , on the basis that a tehsil , like a county , is an administrative unit hierarchically above the local city , town , or village , but subordinate to a larger state or province . However , India and Pakistan have two ( or more , at least in parts of India ) intermediate levels of hierarchyâ '' the District and the tehsil , both of which are sometimes glossed as county . In neither case is the analogy very precise in specific details . The term taluka or taluk is used in some states , including Gujarat , Goa , Maharashtra , Kerala , Tamil Nadu , and Karnataka , and tehsil in others , such as Punjab , Haryana , Uttar Pradesh , Uttarakhand , Himachal Pradesh , Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan . Andhra Pradesh used to have taluks ( with firkas under them ) , but these have now been replaced with mandals . In addresses the abbreviation TK often appears . Each taluka or tehsil is part of a larger District within a State or Union Territory . In some cases , the tehsils of a given District are organized into smaller groups of tehsils called Sub-Division ( Pargana , Anuvibhag ) . The governmental bodies called the panchayat samiti operate at the tehsil level . The villages of a tehsil are grouped into smaller clusters known as hobli . The head of a taluk is given the title Tahalsidar ( à à à à à à à 3\/4 à in Hindi ) . Tahalsidars are charged with the administration of their taluk and report directly to the Deputy Commissioner of the district . In Pakistan , the term tehsil is generally used except in Sindh where the term taluka predominates , e.g. , Larkana Taluka . The tehsil is the second-lowest tier of local government in Pakistan ; each tehsil is part of a larger District ( Zila\/Zilah ) . Each tehsil is subdivided into a number of Union Councils . In the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa , tehsil has the same meaning as explained above except for Malakand Division . In Malakand Division , a District ( Zila\/Zilah ) has two or more Subdivisions and a Subdivision has two or more tehsils . The Subdivisions in Malakand Division are about the same as tehsils in the rest of the country .

Louis-Claude Daquin ( or d'Acquin ) , ( July 4 , 1694 -- June 15 , 1772 ) was a French composer of Jewish birth writing in the Baroque and Galant styles . He was a virtuoso organist and harpsichordist . Louis-Claude Daquin was born in Paris , to a family originating from Italy ( where their name was D'Aquino ) . One of his great-uncles was a professor of Hebrew at the CollÃ ge de France . Daquin was a musical child prodigy . He performed for the court of King Louis XIV at the age of six . He was for a while a pupil of Louis Marchand . At the age of 12 , he became organist at the Sainte-Chapelle , and in the following year took a similar post at the church of the Petit St. Antoine . Henceforth Daquin never lacked for work as an organist . In 1727 he was appointed organist at the church of St. Paul in Paris , ahead of Jean-Philippe Rameau who was also a candidate . Five years later he succeeded his teacher Louis Marchand as organist at the Ã glise des Cordeliers . In 1739 he became organist to the king . In 1755 he was made titular organist at the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris , succeeding Antoine CalviÃ re . By reputation a dazzling performer at the keyboard , Daquin was courted by the aristocracy and his great expertise at the organ drew large crowds to hear him . He was known for his `` unfaltering precision and evenness '' at both the harpsichord and organ . At the age of eight , he conducted his own choral work Beatus Vir . Daquin 's surviving music includes four harpsichord suites , a Nouveau livre de noÃ `` ls for organ and harpsichord ( settings of Christmas pastorals , which include some of his harpsichord improvisations ) , a cantata , and an air Ã boire . Among the most famous of his works are the Swiss Noel ( NoÃ `` l Suisse , No. . XII of his Nouveau livre ) , and Le coucou ( `` The Cuckoo '' ) which is from his 1735 harpsichord suite . Among technical innovations , his Trois cadences for harpsichord contains a triple trill .

Three others ( 59098 , 59099 & 79441 ) went to heritage lines but have now been cut up . The British Rail Class 127 diesel multiple units were built by BR Derby in 1959 . Thirty 4-car units were built , formed of two outer driving motor vehicles , sandwiching two intermediate trailers which were classified class 186 . The technical description of such as 4-car unit was DMBS + TSL + TS + DMBS . The units were almost exclusively used on London St. Pancras to Bedford commuter services , which earned the class the nickname `` Bed-Pan '' units . The class was maintained at a new purpose-built depot at Cricklewood . Unlike other `` Heritage '' DMU units , the class 127 units had hydraulic transmission ( as opposed to the more standard mechanical transmission ) . Power was provided by engines supplied by Rolls-Royce . For further information on the powertrain see British Rail British United Traction . The class 127 units operated one of the most intensive passenger services worked by diesel multiple units , and by the late 1970s , it was clear they needed replacing . It was therefore decided to electrify the Bedford line , and replace the Class 127 units with new Class 317 electrical multiple units . The class 127 units should have been withdrawn by 1982 , however , problems with the new trains meant they had to struggle on in service until early July 1983 . From early 1983 they had commenced operations on the Barking to Gospel Oak line at first running in three-car then finally two-car formations from November 1983 with just the two power cars . The units lasted in service on this line until eventually being withdrawn in March 1984 . The units were then stored at Carlisle depot pending reuse , preservation or scrapping . Subsequently , many trailer vehicles saw further use in combination with Class 116 units , based at Tyseley depot in Birmingham . These lasted until October 1993 . In 1985 , 22 redundant power cars , including the first built , no. 51591 , were rebuilt to form 11 two-car parcels units . Vehicles were renumbered 55966-987 , and formed into sets CH910 to CH920 . Units were fitted with roller shutter doors , and were based at Chester depot . The units lasted in service until 1989 , when they were withdrawn .
Seminiferous tubules are located in the testes , and are the specific location of meiosis , and the subsequent creation of gametes , namely spermatozoa . The epithelium of the tubule consists of sustentacular or Sertoli cells , which are tall , columnar type cells that line the tubule . In between the Sertoli cells are spermatogenic cells , which differentiate through meiosis to sperm cells . There are two types : convoluted and straight , convoluted toward the lateral side , and straight as the tubule comes medially to form ducts that will exit the testis . The seminiferous tubules are formed from primitive sex cords . It is the medullary cords which develop into the seminiferous tubules and the cortical cords regress . The cords were formed from the gonadal ridge .

The 1978 â `` 79 NHL season was the 62nd season of the National Hockey League . The 17 teams of the league played an 80 game season . The Montreal Canadiens beat the New York Rangers in the Stanley Cup finals four games to one for their fourth Cup in a row . This is the last time to date that two of the `` Original Six '' teams met in the finals . This season saw the first reduction in the total number of teams since the Brooklyn Americans folded following the 1941 â `` 42 season . Fearing that two teams were on the verge of folding , the league approved the merger of the financially unstable Cleveland Barons and Minnesota North Stars franchises , reducing the number of teams to seventeen , with the North Stars assuming the Barons ' place in the Adams Division . This reduction would only be temporary , however , as the World Hockey Association would fold following this season , with four of its teams , the Edmonton Oilers , Quebec Nordiques , Winnipeg Jets and Hartford Whalers , joining the NHL as expansion franchises for the 1979 â `` 80 season . For the first time since the NHL All-Star Game became an annual tradition , it was not played . In its stead was the 1979 Challenge Cup , which saw Soviet Union players come over to North America to play against NHL players . The Soviets won the series two games to one . This was the last season until the 2004-05 lockout that the St. Louis Blues missed the playoffs . For the past three seasons , the Montreal Canadiens had dominated the regular season , but times were changing . The New York Islanders had been steadily improving over the past few seasons and this season saw them beat out the Canadiens by one point for the best record in the league .

In July 2009 , the German Bundestag passed a law allowing diacetylmorphine prescription as a standard treatment for addicts ; while diacetylmorphine prescription was started in 2002 , it was only authorized as a large-scale trial . The nasal bones are two small oblong bones , varying in size and form in different individuals ; they are placed side by side at the middle and upper part of the face , and form , by their junction , `` the bridge '' of the nose . Each has two surfaces and four borders . The outer surface is concavoconvex from above downward , convex from side to side ; it is covered by the Procerus and Compressor naris , and perforated about its center by a foramen , for the transmission of a small vein . The inner surface is concave from side to side , and is traversed from above downward , by a groove for the passage of a branch of the nasociliary nerve . The nasal articulates with four bones : two of the cranium , the frontal and ethmoid , and two of the face , the opposite nasal and the maxilla . In primitive bony fish and tetrapods , the nasal bones are the most anterior of a set of four paired bones forming the roof of the skull , being followed in sequence by the frontals , the parietals , and the postparietals . Their form in living species is highly variable , depending on the shape of the head , but they generally form the roof of the snout or beak , running from the nostrils to a position short of the orbits . In most animals , they are generally therefore proportionally larger than in humans or great apes , because of the shortened faces of the latter .
The 5000 metres ( approximately 3.1 mi or 16,404 ft ) is a popular running distance also known as 5 km or 5K ( `` five-K '' ) in American English . It is one of the track events in the Olympic Games and the World Championships in Athletics . `` 5000 metres '' refers to racing on a track and `` 5K '' usually refers to a roadrace or cross country event . While mainly run as an outdoor event , the 5000 m is sometimes run on an indoor track . Official records are kept for both outdoor and indoor 5000 m track events , but not for 5 km road races . Much of the distance 's popularity is due to the challenge it offers to both novices and accomplished professionals . It is a distance race that demands a great deal of aerobic endurance whilst speed is necessary . Tactics also play a key role , and the combination makes it attractive to many . The first world record in the men 's 5000 metres was recognized by the International Association of Athletics Federations in 1912 . As of June 21 , 2009 , 35 world records have been ratified by the IAAF in the event . Auto times to the hundredth of a second were accepted by the IAAF for events up to and including 10,000 m from 1981 . Dick Quax 's 13:12.9 from 1977 was recorded as 13:12.87 to the hundredth of a second . The first world record in the women 's 5000 metres was recognized by the International Association of Athletics Federations in 1981 . As of June 21 , 2009 , 13 world records have been ratified by the IAAF in the event . ran 15:01.83 in 1984 , but this time was not ratified as a world record .
`` Time for Miracles '' is Adam Lambert 's second single . It was released on October 16 , 2009 via Amazon.com . Although the song was his first since American Idol , it was not released as his official debut single . Instead , the title track to his album , For Your Entertainment , was released . The song is featured as the ending theme in the disaster film 2012 . A full version of the song was released on October 17 , 2009 , via YouTube and on October 20th , 2009 via digital download . The song was written by Alain Johannes and his partner Natasha Shneider , who were probably best known for contributing to several Queens of the Stone Age albums . Shneider died of cancer in 2008 . For additional information on his recording career , refer to Adam Lambert discography . Before `` Time for Miracles '' was released to the public , it had already garnered positive reviews . Brian May of Queen was able to listen to the full track and praised the song as `` truly sensational '' and complimented Lambert 's vocals , stating , `` Adam 's voice reaches out with sensitivity , depth , maturity , and awesome range and power that will make jaws drop all around the world . '' Having heard only the preview of the track , Entertainment Weeklys Michael Slezak stated that the song `` sounds like it has the potential to be a power-ballad smash '' . The official music video was released on October 21 , through MySpace . The video portrays Lambert walking placidly through a disaster scene , like those portrayed in 2012 . Footage from the film and the clips of Adam singing are edited together . Another music video , popularized on YouTube does not show Lambert at all , but rather a disaster sequence showing the lead characters of the film trying to escape the destruction of Los Angeles , California . In the movie , a slightly different version of the song is played during the closing credits . On the chart week ending November 7 , 2009 , `` Time for Miracles '' debuted at # 50 on the Billboard Hot 100 . In the United States , the song has sold 124,000 legal digital downloads .

Mimas ( , or as Greek Î Î Î 1\/4 á 3\/4 Ï ) is a moon of Saturn which was discovered in 1789 by William Herschel . It is named after Mimas , a son of Gaia in Greek mythology , and is also designated Saturn I. By diameter ( 396 kilometers ) the twentieth largest moon in the solar system , Mimas is the smallest known astronomical body that is thought to be rounded in shape due to self-gravitation . Mimas was discovered by the astronomer William Herschel on 17 September 1789 . He recorded his discovery as follows : `` The great light of my forty-foot telescope was so useful that on the 17th of September , 1789 , I remarked the seventh satellite , then situated at its greatest western elongation . '' Mimas is named after one of the Titans in Greek mythology , Mimas . The names of all seven then-known satellites of Saturn , including Mimas , were suggested by William Herschel 's son John in his 1847 publication Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope . He named them after Titans specifically because Saturn ( the Roman equivalent of Kronos in Greek mythology ) , was the leader of the Titans . The low density of Mimas , 1.15 g\/cm3 , indicates that it is composed mostly of water ice with only a small amount of rock . Due to the tidal forces acting on it , the moon is not perfectly spherical ; its longest axis is about 10 % longer than the shortest . The ellipsoid shape of Mimas is especially noticeable in recent images from the Cassini probe . Mimas ' most distinctive feature is a colossal impact crater 130 k across , named Herschel after the moon 's discoverer . Herschel 's diameter is almost a third of the moon 's own diameter ; its walls are approximately 5 k high , parts of its floor measure 10 k deep , and its central peak rises 6 k above the crater floor . If there were a crater of an equivalent scale on Earth it would be over 4000 k in diameter , wider than Canada . The impact that made this crater must have nearly shattered Mimas : fractures can be seen on the opposite side of Mimas that may have been created by shock waves from the impact traveling through the moon 's body . The surface of Mimas is saturated with smaller impact craters , but no others are anywhere near the size of Herschel . Although Mimas is heavily cratered , the cratering is not uniform . Most of the surface is covered with craters greater than 40 k in diameter , but in the south polar region , craters greater than 20 k are generally lacking . This suggests that some process removed the larger craters from these areas , or that something prevented larger bodies from hitting the south polar region . Two types of geological feature are officially recognized on Mimas : craters and chasmata ( chasms ) . ( See also : List of geological features on Mimas ) A number of features in Saturn 's rings are related to resonances with Mimas . Mimas is responsible for clearing the material from the Cassini Division , the gap between Saturn 's two widest rings , the A ring and B ring . Particles in the Huygens Gap at the inner edge of the Cassini division are in a 2:1 resonance with Mimas . They orbit twice for each orbit of Mimas . The repeated pulls by Mimas on the Cassini division particles , always in the same direction in space , force them into new orbits outside the gap . The boundary between the C and B ring is in a 3:1 resonance with Mimas . Recently , the G ring was found to be in a 7:6 co-rotation eccentricity resonance with Mimas ; the ring 's inner edge is about 15000 k inside Mimas ' orbit . Mimas is also in a 4:2 mean motion resonance with the larger moon Tethys , and in a 2:3 resonance with the outer F ring shepherd moonlet , Pandora . Mimas has been imaged several times by the Cassini orbiter . The closest flyby occurred on February 13 , 2010 , when Cassini passed by Mimas at 9500 k. When seen from certain angles , Mimas closely resembles the Death Star , a fictional space station known from the film Star Wars Episode IV : A New Hope , which is said to be roughly 140 kilometres in diameter . This resemblance stems from the fact that Herschel can appear in Mimas ' northern hemisphere , much like the concave disc of the Death Star 's `` superlaser '' . This is purely coincidental , as the first film was made three years before the first close-up photographs of Mimas were taken . In 2010 , NASA revealed a temperature map of Mimas , using images obtained by Cassini . The warmest regions , which are along one edge of the moon , create a shape similar to the video game character Pac-Man , with Herschel Crater assuming the role of an `` edible dot '' known from Pac-Man gameplay . The Red Dwarf novel Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers is partially set on Mimas . Mimas is owned by the Spanish government , and is home to many bars and brothels , with a heavy organized crime presence .
Paul & Paula ( Ray Hildebrand , born December 21 , 1940 ; Jill Jackson , born May 20 , 1942 ) , were a pop singing duo , best known for their 1963 million selling # 1 hit record , `` Hey Paula . '' Hildebrand was born in Joshua , Texas , and Jackson in McCamey , Texas . Both were attending Howard Payne College in Brownwood , Texas in 1962 when a local disc jockey , Riney Jordan , asked listeners to come to the studio and sing their songs to help the American Cancer Society . The duo sang a song called `` Hey Paula , '' which Hildebrand wrote , and were encouraged to make a record of it . Shelby Singleton of Mercury Records eventually signed them , but not before changing their professional name ( Singleton reasoned that a pair named Ray and Jill singing about `` Hey , hey Paula '' and `` Hey , hey Paul '' did not make sense ) . `` Hey Paula '' sold over two million copies globally , and was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America ( R.I.A.A. ) in 1963 . The pairing of Paul & Paula was credited with inspiring other famous male\/female pairings down the line , mostly from record companies that had originally turned the duo down in 1962 : Jerry Butler was quickly paired with Betty Everett , and Marvin Gaye was paired with a number of female partners before Motown finally settled on Tammi Terrell . The duo released two regular albums and a Christmas-themed album after the success of `` Hey Paula '' , which charted at # 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the entire month of February 1963 . Their follow-up , `` Young Lovers , '' reached # 6 on the Billboard chart later in the same year . In 1965 , Hildebrand left the act to complete his college education , having decided that a future in show business was not for him . He made this decision in the middle of a Dick Clark Caravan of Stars road trip , and Clark had to fill in at the last minute . Jackson went on with a solo career and Hildebrand returned to singing in the 1980s in the Christian duo Land & Hildebrand . Today , the twosome get together from time-to-time to sing as Paul & Paula for special events . In 2002 , Hildebrand and Jackson returned to Howard Payne College to be the homecoming guests of honor and Grand Marshalls .
Asclepias curassavica , commonly called Mexican Butterfly Weed , Blood-flower or Scarlet Milkweed , is a species of flowering plant in the dogbane family , Apocynaceae . It is native to the American tropics . It has a pantropical distribution as an introduced species . It is grown as an ornamental garden plant and as a source of food for butterflies . Typical plants are evergreen perennial subshrubs that grow up to 1 m tall and have pale gray stems . The leaves are arranged oppositely on the stems and are lanceolate or oblong-lanceolate shaped ending in acuminate or acute tips . Like other members of the genus , the sap is milky . The flowers are in cymes with 10-20 flowers each . They have purple or red corollas and corona lobes that are yellow or orange . Flowering occurs nearly year round . The 5 - long , fusiform shaped fruits are called follicles . The follicles contain tan to brown seeds that are ovate in shape and 6 - long . The flat seeds have silky hairs that allow the seeds to float on air currents when the pod-like follicles dehisce ( split open ) . There are a number of different cultivars with improved flower colors and shorter habit , some have brilliant red , yellow or orange colored flowers . Asclepias curassavica is excellent in butterfly gardens or as a cut flower .
If there are two family names , these can both be stated . See Mount Olivet Cemetery for other cemeteries with this name . Mount Olivet Cemetery is a Roman Catholic cemetery located in Chicago , Illinois . The cemetery is operated by the Archdiocese of Chicago . The cemetery is located at 2755 West 111th St. Mount Olivet was consecrated in 1855 , and was the first Catholic cemetery to be established in the south side of Chicago . There are over 142,200 people buried at the cemetery , with over 150 annual interments . The cemetery is 93 a in size . It became one of the first major area cemeteries to become full , until the purchase and development of additional lands along what had been the eastern border of the cemetery . Mount Olivet was the original burial location of Al Capone , who was laid to rest between the graves of his father and brother .

San Luis Pass is a strait of water at the south-western end of Galveston Island off the shores of the U.S. state of Texas . It connects the sheltered waters of West Bay to the open Gulf of Mexico . Pier fishing on the San Luis Pass Pier was a favorite for visitors and locals alike for many years , however the beach and pier were wiped out during Hurricane Ike in 2008 , and is unable to be rebuilt . The pass is also home to bank fishermen who often travel many miles to take advantage of the excellent redfish population from June thru October . Overnight camping , while once allowed , is prohibited on the Galveston side of the pass . Swimmers and fishermen have been killed in the Pass ' treacherous waters , largely due to murky water , uncharted drop-offs , and fast moving currents . The San Luis Pass Camp Ground and county park is the only accessible place now . Hurricane Ike in September 2008 , forever changed the topography of the beach . What was once a driveway and public beach access is now part of the Gulf of Mexico . The land where the Bait house of the pier once stood , is now permanently submerged .

This game takes place after the events in Ape Escape , where Kakeru ( Spike in the U.S. version , named `` Spike '' in the original U.K. Ape Escape ) stopped Specter from taking over the world . It is a few years later , and The Professor left for a vacation leaving his granddaughter , Natsumi ( Natalie in the U.S. version ) , and Spike 's cousin , Hikaru ( Jimmy in the U.S. version ) , to watch over the laboratory . The Professor has left them with one task : deliver a load of monkey pants to the monkeys in Monkey Park . Hikaru accidentally sends not only the monkey pants , but The Peak Point Helmets as well . Specter gets a hold of one , and yet again makes an army of monkeys bent on ruling the world . Jimmy aims to capture all the monkeys and stop Specter . However , Specter has supplied five monkeys with Vita-Z bananas , making them stronger and more intelligent than the average monkeys . Hikaru manages to capture all of the Freaky Monkey Five , except Yellow Monkey . Before his fight with White Monkey , Pipotchi , a baby monkey accompanying Hikaru , is kidnapped , in order to transfer the data in his Peak Point Helmet into a device called the Lethargy Laser . Rescuing Pipotchi , Hikaru makes his way through a monkey controlled military base , and confronts Specter , who is waiting for him with a hi-tech gunship . Before the two can battle , Yellow Monkey , now a giant monster thanks to an overdose on Vita-Z bananas attacks the facility . Specter flees , and Hikaru manages to downsize and capture Yellow . Hikaru , the Professor and Natsumi then discover the purpose of the Lethargy Laser . By firing it at the globe , all humans worldwide will lose the will to fight back , making it easier for Specter and the monkeys to take over the world . Hikaru confronts Specter at his moonbase , who attacks him with a giant robot . Once defeated , Specter attempts to fire the laser , but Hikaru states that humans will never give up , and captures him . Jimmy and Pipotchi then flee the exploding moonbase . Shortly afterwards , Specter escapes and goes into hiding . Hikaru then proceeds to capture all the remaining monkeys before the Professor discovers Specter 's hiding place . Hikaru warps there , encountering Specter , and the two of them battle again . Specter loses and is once again captured . The game ends with Spike visiting the laboratory , which is destroyed when Hikaru accidentally crashes a spaceship into it . Gameplay is similar to the previous game . Movement is controlled with the left analog stick and R buttons , and gadgets are controlled with the right analog stick . Three new gadgets are added , the Electro Magnet , used for pulling metal blocks and clinging onto metal surfaces , the Water Cannon used for putting out fires , and the Bananarang , that can attract monkeys with a banana fragrance . A new feature is the ability to change the gadget loadout by holding down one of the gadget buttons and changing the gadget . Also introduced in this game is Pipotchi , a sidekick who can assist Jimmy in reaching ledges and occasionally revive him if he 's knocked out . Also , the gotcha coins that spawn from enemies are used as currency for bonuses , and can multiply in worth if left alone . Like in the previous game , Ape Escape 2 features minigames , this time to get them you pay for them with Gotcha Coins collected through the levels via a vending machine called the `` Gotcha Box '' in the hub when you 've got up to a certain stage in the game . The three minigames are Dance Monkey Dance , Monkey Soccer , and Monkey Climber .

Roberto Martin Antonio `` Bobby '' Bonilla ( , born February 23 , 1963 in The Bronx , New York ) is a former player in Major League Baseball who played from 1986 to 2001 . Known in his playing days as `` Bobby Bo , '' Bonilla is of Puerto Rican descent . Bonilla was signed out of high school by Pittsburgh Pirates scout Syd Thrift . His rise through the Pirates ' farm system came to a halt during spring training in 1985 when he broke his right leg in a collision with teammate Bip Roberts . The White Sox then acquired him through the Rule 5 Draft . After making his major league debut with Chicago , Bonilla was regularly hazed by veteran players and Negro League Baseball star Buck O'Neil who put shaving cream in his shoes . Syd Thrift , then the Pirates ' General Manager , reacquired the unhappy Bonilla in exchange for pitcher Jose DeLeon . Bonilla also played from 1984 to 1988 with the Mayaguez Indians of the Puerto Rican Winter League . Bonilla became the Pirates ' starting third baseman in 1987 but after committing a whopping 67 errors over his next two seasons at the hot corner , manager Jim Leyland moved him to right field . There he formed a formidable combination alongside stars Barry Bonds and Andy Van Slyke and helped propel the Pittsburgh Pirates to two of their three straight NL East titles from 1990-1992 . During a 1989 incident , Bonilla was reportedly reprimanded for his assault on club house attendant Gabe Thomas . He later claimed he was only upset because Thomas was allegedly told by Bonilla to remove the mesh from the seating at Three Rivers so his family could keep their distance from other fans . His family never made the trip from D.C. In 1992 , he was signed as a free agent by the New York Mets to a ( then ) very lucrative 5 year , $ 29 million contract ( $ in current dollar terms ) . But without his fellow Pirate stars around him , his offensive production dropped . His stay in New York would also be marred by a number of incidents , such as threatening sportswriter Bob Klapisch that he would `` show him the Bronx '' in response to his book on the 1992 Mets , The Worst Team Money Could Buy : The Collapse Of The New York Mets ( ISBN 978-0803278226 ) . On another occasion , he called the press box during a game to complain about an error that he was charged with . Finally , in 1995 , Bonilla was traded by the Mets with a player to be named later to the Baltimore Orioles for Damon Buford and Alex Ochoa . After helping the Orioles to the American League Championship Series in 1996 , he was once again granted free agency and signed with the Florida Marlins . Reunited with his old manager , Jim Leyland , he helped the Marlins win the 1997 World Series . He spent the 1998 season with the Los Angeles Dodgers . In 1999 , the New York Mets reacquired Bonilla from the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Mel Rojas . Again , his level of play did not measure up to expectations and he had numerous clashes with manager Bobby Valentine over lack of playing time . His tenure in New York culminated in an infamous incident during Game Six of the 1999 NLCS where the Mets were eliminated by the Braves in a gut-wrenching eleven inning game while Bonilla reportedly sat in the clubhouse playing cards with teammate Rickey Henderson . In the same series , he was one of the first batters to face John Smoltz for the first time as a closing pitcher . John struck him out on three consecutive pitches , Bobby never swung the bat . The New York Mets placed Bonilla on unconditional waivers in 2000 . He spent the 2000 season playing for the Atlanta Braves . The Mets agreed to pay out the remainder of Bonilla 's contract by deferring the $ 5.9 million that he was due . The Mets will pay him 25 equal payments of $ 1,193,248.20 every July 1 from 2011 until 2035 , assuming an annual interest rate of 8 % during the period 2011-2035 , . In 2001 , he was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals , but was released due to an injury and the success of his replacement , Albert Pujols . He played his final game on October 7 , 2001 . Overall , Bobby Bonilla was a six-time All-Star , and had career statistics of 2010 hits , 287 home runs , 1173 runs batted in , and a career .279 batting average .
Boscobel House , in the parish of Boscobel on the Shropshire\/Staffordshire border , near Wolverhampton and Albrighton , England , was built around 1632 , when landowner John Giffard of White Ladies Priory converted a timber-framed farmhouse into a hunting lodge . Boscobel House became one of the most evocative sites in the English historical imagination . It was at this property that Charles II hid in a tree to escape discovery by Parliamentary soldiers after the Battle of Worcester . See also the article on Escape of Charles II . It is a Grade II \* listed building and has several other listed features . It is under the care of English Heritage . Giffard called the new hunting lodge Boscobel House which is believed to come from the Italian phrase `` bosco bello '' meaning `` in the midst of fair woods '' . In 1632 , Boscobel House was surrounded by dense woodlands . The Giffard family were Catholics and , at that time , the Catholic religion was viewed with great suspicion . The house itself served as a secret place for the shelter of Catholic priests with numerous priest-holes and hiding places dotted around the premises . This secret purpose of the house was to play a key part in the history of the country . Near the end of the English Civil War , after the Battle of Worcester , Charles II fled for his life , seeking refuge at Boscobel House . Colonel William Careless and the King spent all day hiding in a nearby oak tree ( which became known as The Royal Oak ) from where he could see the patrols searching for him . Later Charles spent the night hiding in one of Boscobelâ s Priest holes .
Maria Luisa of Savoy ( Maria Luisa Gabriella ; 17 September 1688 -- 14 February 1714 ) was a Savoyard princess and the first wife of Philip V of Spain . She acted as Regent of Spain and had great influence over her husband . She is closely associated with Princesse des Ursins . She was the third daughter and second surviving child of Victor Amadeus II , Duke of Savoy and his French-born wife Anne Marie d'Orl Ã ans , the youngest daughter of Philippe of France and Henrietta of England . Throughout her life , Maria Luisa remained close to her older sister Maria Adelaide who later married Louis , Duke of Burgundy , the eldest grandson of Louis XIV . In her youth , Maria Luisa was described as playful and fun loving and had received a good education . Philip V of Spain , a French prince , was recently crowned King of Spain upon the death of childless Charles II . In order to enforce his shaky authority over Spain due to his French birth , Philip V decided to maintain ties with Victor Amadeus II , Duke of Savoy . Philip V 's brother , Louis , Duke of Burgundy , had married the elder sister of Maria Luisa several years earlier , and in mid 1701 , Philip V asked for Maria Luisa 's hand with the permission of his grandfather Louis XIV . Maria Luisa was wed by proxy to Philip V on 12 September 1701 at the age of barely thirteen and was escorted to Nice , arriving there on 18 September . While in Nice , she was greeted by Pope Clement XI who gave her the Golden Rose on 20 September as a token of his affection for the young princess . Within a week , she sailed from Nice for Antibes and was taken to Barcelona . The official marriage took place on 2 November 1701 . The princesse des Ursins was a member of the household of the Queen . She would maintain great influence over Maria Luisa as her Camarera Mayor , chief of the household to the young queen , who was still a child . The couple were deeply in love . In 1702 , Philip V was obliged to leave Spain to fight in Naples as part of the ongoing War of Spanish Succession . During her husband 's absence , Maria Luisa acted as Regent from Madrid . She was praised as an effective ruler , having successfully implemented various changes in government and insisted upon all complaints being investigated and reports made direct to her . Her leadership encouraged the reorganization in the junta and , in doing this , inspiring people and their cities to make donations towards the war effort . Despite her young age , Maria Luisa 's effective regency made her admired in Madrid and throughout Spain . After her husband 's return in 1703 , she resumed her role as queen consort . In 1704 , the Princesse des Ursins was exiled at the order of Louis XIV , devastating Maria Luisa . However , in 1705 , the Princesse des Ursins returned to Madrid , much to the joy of the young queen . Maria Luisa gave birth to the couple 's first child , Infante Luis Felipe in 1707 . After the birth of her eldest child , Maria Luisa went on giving birth to three more children , two of whom would survive infancy . Towards the end of her life , the Queen became ill with tuberculosis . She eventually died from the effects of tuberculosis on 14 February 1714 . She was buried at San Lorenzo de El Escorial . In December 1714 , just months after Maria Luisa 's death , her widower Philip V remarried , to Elisabeth Farnese , the only child and heiress of Duke of Parma . All of Maria Luisa 's children were to die without issue , leaving behind no descendants of Maria Luisa of Savoy . Maria Luisa died in her 25th year . She was nicknamed La Savoyana by her adoring subjects and was well loved in Spain . After her death , two of her sons , her youngest and oldest , were to become Kings of Spain . Her niece , Princess Maria Luisa was named after her .
Branchiopoda is a class of crustaceans . It is the sister group to the remaining crustaceans , and comprises fairy shrimp , clam shrimp , Cladocera and Notostraca . They are mostly small , freshwater animals that feed on plankton and detritus , with the exception of the Cladocera , many of which are marine . Members of the Branchiopoda are unified by the presence of gills on many of the animal 's appendages , including some of the mouthparts . This is also responsible for the name of the group ( from the , gills , akin to , windpipe ; , foot ) . They generally possess compound eyes and a carapace , which may be a shell of two valves enclosing the trunk ( as in most Cladocera ) , broad and shallow ( as in the Notostraca ) , or entirely absent ( as in the Anostraca ) . In the groups where the carapace prevents the use of the trunk limbs for swimming ( Cladocera , clam shrimp and the extinct Lipostraca ) , the antennae are used for locomotion , as they are in the nauplius . Male fairy shrimp have an enlarged pair of antennae with which they grasp the female during mating , while the bottom-feeding Notostraca , the antennae are reduced to vestiges . The trunk limbs are beaten in a metachronal rhythm , causing a flow of water along the midline of the animal , from which it derives oxygen , food and , in the case of the Anostraca and Notostraca , movement . Among the branchiopods , only the cladocerans are found in the sea ; all the other groups are found in fresh water , including temporary pools . Most branchiopodans eat floating detritus or plankton , which they take using the setae on their appendages . In early taxonomic treatments , the current members of the Branchiopoda were all placed in a single genus , Monoculus . The taxon Branchiopoda was erected by Pierre AndrÃ Latreille in 1817 , initially at the rank of order . The fairy shrimp of the order Anostraca are usually 6 - long ( exceptionally up to 170 m ) . Most species have 20 body segments , bearing 11 pairs of leaf-like phyllopodia ( swimming legs ) , and the body lacks a carapace . They live in vernal pools and hypersaline lakes across the world , including pools in deserts , in ice-covered mountain lakes and in Antarctica . They swim `` upside-down '' and feed by filtering organic particles from the water or by scraping algae from surfaces . They are an important food for many birds and fish , and are cultured and harvested for use as fish food . There are 300 species spread across 8 families . The order Notostraca comprises the single family Triopsidae , containing the tadpole shrimp or shield shrimp . The two genera , Triops and Lepidurus , are considered living fossils , having not changed significantly in outward form since the Triassic . They have a broad , flat carapace , which conceals the head and bears a single pair of compound eyes . The abdomen is long , appears to be segmented and bears numerous pairs of flattened legs . The telson is flanked by a pair of long , thin caudal rami . Phenotypic plasticity within taxa makes species-level identification difficult , and is further compounded by variation in the mode of reproduction . Notostracans are omnivores living on the bottom of temporary pools and shallow lakes . Clam shrimp are bivalved animals which have lived since at least the Devonian . The three groups are not believed to form a clade . They have 10 â `` 32 trunk segments , decreasing in size from front to back , and each bears a pair of legs which also carry gills . A strong muscle can close the two halves of the shell together . Cladocera is an order of small crustaceans commonly called water fleas . Around 620 species have been recognized so far , with may more undescribed . They are ubiquitous in inland aquatic habitats , but rare in the oceans . Most are 0.2 - long , with a down-turned head , and a carapace covering the apparently unsegmented thorax and abdomen . There is a single median compound eye . Most species show cyclical parthenogenesis , where asexual reproduction is occasionally supplemented by sexual reproduction , which produces resting eggs that allow the species to survive harsh conditions and disperse to distant habitats . Branchiopods are considered the most primitive of the crustacean classes , and the sister group to the remaining crustaceans . The fossil record of branchiopods extends back at least into the Upper Cambrian and possibly further . The group is thought to be monophyletic , with the Anostraca having been the first group to branch off . It is thought that the group evolved in the seas , but was forced into temporary pools and hypersaline lakes by the evolution of bony fishes .

Primarily , nap is the raised ( fuzzy ) surface on certain kinds of cloth , such as velvet . Nap can refer additionally to other surfaces that look like the surface of a napped cloth , such as the surface of a felt or beaver hat . Starting around the 14th century , the word referred originally to the roughness of woven cloth before it was sheared . When cloth , especially woollen cloth , is woven , the surface of the cloth is not smooth , and this roughness is the nap . Generally the cloth is then ` sheared ' to create an even surface , and the nap is thus removed . Since the 15th century , the term nap generally refers to a special pile given to the cloth . The term pile refers to raised fibers that are there on purpose , rather than as a by product of producing the cloth . In this case , the nap is woven into the cloth , often by weaving loops into the fabric , which can then be cut or left intact . Carpets , rugs , velvet , velor , and velveteen , are made by interlacing a secondary yarn through woven cloth , creating a nap or pile . In the finishing process of manufacturing textiles , after the cloth is woven , it goes through processes such as washing , fulling , raising the nap , and trimming the nap . After the nap is trimmed , the fabric is considered finished . The raising process , which draws out the ends of the fibers , is done on both woollen and cotton fabric . Flannelette is a cotton fabric that goes through this process . There are ways to ` raise the nap ' , most of which involve wire brushes such as raising cards . Originally , dried teasel pods were used and were still preferred for use on woollen cloth for a long time . Woollen fabrics , which must be damp when raising the nap , are then dried and stretched before the nap is trimmed or sheared . Cotton cloth goes straight to the shearing process , where the nap gets trimmed to ensure that all the raised fibers are the same length .
The longhorn beetles ( Cerambycidae ; also known as long-horned beetles or longicorns ) are a cosmopolitan family of beetles , typically characterized by extremely long antennae , which are often as long as or longer than the beetle 's body . In various members of the family , however , the antennae are quite short ( e.g. , Neandra brunnea , figured below ) and such species can be difficult to distinguish from related beetle families such as Chrysomelidae . The family is large , with over 20,000 species described , slightly more than half from the Eastern Hemisphere . Several are serious pests , with the larvae boring into wood , where they can cause extensive damage to either living trees or untreated lumber ( or , occasionally , to wood in buildings ; the old-house borer , Hylotrupes bajulus , being a particular problem indoors ) . A number of species mimic ants , bees , and wasps , though a majority of species are cryptically colored . The rare giant long-horned beetle ( Titanus giganteus ) from northeastern South America is often considered the largest ( though not the heaviest , and not the longest including legs ) insect , with a maximum known body length of just over 16 centimeters . As with many large families , different authorities have tended to recognize many different subfamilies , or sometimes split subfamilies off as separate families entirely ( e.g. , Disteniidae , Oxypeltidae , and Vesperidae ; ) ; there is thus some instability and controversy regarding the constituency of the Cerambycidae ( e.g. , ) . There are few truly defining features for the group as a whole , at least as adults , as there are occasional species or species groups which may lack any given feature ; the family and its closest relatives , therefore , constitute a taxonomically difficult group , and relationships of the various lineages are still poorly understood .

Gary Twigg ( born 19 March 1984 in Glasgow ) is a Scottish footballer who currently plays for Shamrock Rovers in the League of Ireland . Twigg began his career with English club Derby County having germinated through the youth system . He made his debut for Derby at the age of 17 as a striker in a Premier League match against Sunderland in May 2002 , his only appearance that season . In the 2002-03 season , he made eight first team appearances , seven as a substitute , branching out into the position of left wing when needed . In September 2003 he joined Burton Albion on loan , for whom he made four appearances scoring one goal . He also had a loan spell at Bristol Rovers later that season , featuring eight times but failing to find the net . However , he mainly played at left back at Bristol Rovers . Having been released by Derby , and following an unsuccessful trial period at League of Ireland club Derry City , he placed roots at Airdrie United in August 2005 , where he went on to make 65 league and cup appearances in two years , scoring 18 goals . He won the SFL Player of the Month award for December 2006 after scoring six goals in six games , helping Airdrie to only one defeat out of six league games . Twigg signed a two-year contract with Conference National side Oxford United on 5 July 2007 . Nick Merry , Oxford United chairman , said , `` He 's got a good record and he 's very versatile too . He can play wide or down the middle and he 'll be a good asset to us . '' He came on as a substitute on the opening day of the 2007-08 season at home against Forest Green Rovers in which he won and scored a stoppage time penalty to win the game for Oxford on his debut . An ankle injury that required surgery in October led to him missing seven weeks of the season before he returned to the side in December . However , he was unable to settle and left at the end of December to seek a move back to Scotland . He had made 11 league and cup appearances , scoring three goals . Twigg signed for Hamilton Academical on an 18 month contract in January 2008 . He made only four appearances and was transfer listed at the end of the season . His contract was canceled at Twigg 's request in July 2008 . Twigg then signed for Brechin City in July 2008 , In February 2009 , he followed manager Michael O'Neill from Brechin to Shamrock Rovers . After scoring on his debut in a friendly in Athlone Town Twigg then scored the first ever goal in the Tallaght Stadium in a 2-1 win for Shamrock Rovers over Sligo Rovers in March 2009 . Twigg scored his 22nd league goal in a 2-1 win over Sligo Rovers . Scored his 23rd league goal at Dundalk , equalling Stephen Geoghegan 's total from the 1993\/94 season . Gary was awarded the League of Ireland Player of the Month for September 2009 . Twigg finished the 2009 season as the top scorer in the League of Ireland with 24 goals . He also won the club Player of the Year voted by Rovers fans and the PFAI Player of the Year voted for by his fellow players across the league . He scored his tenth league goal of the 2010 season in a 3-0 defeat of Bohemians on 8 August . That night he was presented with the League of Ireland 2009 Player of the Year award . He scored his 50th goal in total for the club in a 2-2 draw with Bray Wanderers . The result was enough for Rovers to win the 2010 League of Ireland title , their first league title in 16 years .

A covalent bond is a form of chemical bonding that is characterized by the sharing of pairs of electrons between atoms , and other covalent bonds . In short , the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms when they share electrons is known as covalent bonding . Covalent bonding includes many kinds of interaction , including Ï - bonding , Ï - bonding , metal to metal bonding , agostic interactions , and three-center two-electron bonds . The term covalent bond dates from 1939 . The prefix co - means jointly , associated in action , partnered to a lesser degree , etc. ; thus a `` co-valent bond '' , essentially , means that the atoms share `` valence '' , such as is discussed in valence bond theory . In the molecule H2 , the hydrogen atoms share the two electrons via covalent bonding . Covalency is greatest between atoms of similar electronegativities . Thus , covalent bonding does not necessarily require the two atoms be of the same elements , only that they be of comparable electronegativity . Although covalent bonding entails sharing of electrons , it is not necessarily delocalized . Furthermore , in contrast to electrostatic interactions ( `` ionic bonds '' ) the strength of covalent bond depends on the angular relation between atoms in polyatomic molecules . The term `` covalence '' in regard to bonding was first used in 1919 by Irving Langmuir in a Journal of the American Chemical Society article entitled `` The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules '' . Langmuir wrote that `` we shall denote by the term covalence the number of pairs of electrons which a given atom shares with its neighbors . '' The idea of covalent bonding can be traced several years before 1919 to Gilbert N. Lewis , who in 1916 described the sharing of electron pairs between atoms . He introduced the so called Lewis notation or electron dot notation or The Lewis Dot Structure in which valence electrons ( those in the outer shell ) are represented as dots around the atomic symbols . Pairs of electrons located between atoms represent covalent bonds . Multiple pairs represent multiple bonds , such as double and triple bonds . Some examples of Electron Dot Notation are shown in the following figure . An alternative form of representation , not shown here , has bond-forming electron pairs represented as solid lines . While the idea of shared electron pairs provides an effective qualitative picture of covalent bonding , quantum mechanics is needed to understand the nature of these bonds and predict the structures and properties of simple molecules . Walter Heitler and Fritz London are credited with the first successful quantum mechanical explanation of a chemical bond , specifically that of molecular hydrogen , in 1927 . Their work was based on the valence bond model , which assumes that a chemical bond is formed when there is good overlap between the atomic orbitals of participating atoms . These atomic orbitals are known to have specific angular relationships between each other , and thus the valence bond model can successfully predict the bond angles observed in simple molecules . Covalent bonds are affected by the electronegativity of the connected atoms . Two atoms with equal electronegativity will make non-polar covalent bonds such as H-H . An unequal relationship creates a polar covalent bond such as with H-Cl . There are three types of covalent substances : individual molecules , molecular structures , and macromolecular structures . Individual molecules have strong bonds which hold the atoms together , but there are negligible forces of attraction between molecules . Such covalent substances are gases . For example , HCl , SO2 , CO2 , and CH4 . In molecular structures there are weak forces of attraction . Such covalent substances are low boiling temperature liquids ( such as ethanol ) , and low melting temperature solids ( such as iodine and solid CO2 ) . Macromolecular structures have large numbers of atoms linked in chains or sheets ( such as graphite ) , or in 3-dimensional structures ( such as diamond and quartz ) . These substances have high melting and boiling points , are frequently brittle , and tend to have high electrical resistivity . Elements that have high electronegativity , and the ability to form three or four electron pair bonds , often form such large macromolecular structures .
The Manchester Monarchs are a professional ice hockey team in the American Hockey League ( AHL ) . They play in Manchester , New Hampshire at the Verizon Wireless Arena . They have been the AHL affiliate of the Los Angeles Kings since 2001 . The Monarchs played their first game on October 6 , 2001 against the Lowell Lock Monsters , losing 6 â `` 3 . Their first win was a week later , on October 13 , 2001 , against the Norfolk Admirals . The team has been competitive within the division every year of its existence . They won their first Atlantic Division title in 2004 â `` 05 , but lost in the first round to the Providence Bruins . This continued the streak of first round playoff exits , which the team had experienced in every year of existence , and would come to include the 2005 â `` 06 season . 2006 â `` 07 was the team 's best season to date . With rookie head coach Mark Morris , leading scorers Matt Moulson and Noah Clarke , and former league MVP Jason LaBarbera in goal , the team had their best finish ever , winning the Atlantic Division title with the second-best points total in the league . Heading into the playoffs , there were doubts within the team , as star goaltender LaBarbera had ended the season injured . The team faced the Worcester Sharks in the first round . With LaBarbera coming back by Game 2 , the Monarchs defeated the Sharks in six games , including double-overtime thrillers in Games 2 and 6 . The second round brought the Providence Bruins , who put up as much â '' if not more â '' of a fight . The Monarchs found a way , however , and defeated the Bruins in six games . This brought the Monarchs to their first ever Eastern Conference finals , but they were swept by the defending champions â '' the Hershey Bears â '' in four games . Following their run in 2007 , the Monarchs looked to have holes to fill , as Jason LaBarbera was brought up to the Kings , along with several other players . The 2007 â `` 08 season was an up and down one , which ended following a sweep by the Providence Bruins in the first round of the playoffs . 2008 â `` 09 was a landmark year for the franchise , but not in the way they would hope . Despite a late surge , the team finished fifth , five points out of the playoffs , for the first time in franchise history . The first half of the 2009-2010 season has proven to be successful for that year 's Monarchs squad . Several players have been promoted to Los Angeles , including Rich Clune and Alec Martinez . The Monarchs won their home opener of the 2010-2011 season , as David Meckler scored the game-winning goal in front of 9,035 fans at the Verizon Wireless Arena on October 16 , 2010 . The game was also noteworthy as left wing Brandon Kozun and center Justin Azevedo were awarded penalty shots , the first time in franchise history that two players were awarded penalty shots in the same game Goals : 46 Mike Cammalleri ( 2004 â `` 05 ) Assists : 63 Mike Cammalleri ( 2004 â `` 05 ) Points : 109 Mike Cammalleri ( 2004 â `` 05 ) Penalty minutes : 322 Joe Rullier ( 2004 â `` 05 ) GAA : 1.93 Adam Hauser ( 2004 â `` 05 ) SV % : .933 Adam Hauser ( 2004 â `` 05 )

Spider Kiss ( originally entitled Rockabilly ) is a 1961 novel by author Harlan Ellison . The novel follows the meteoric rise and eventual fall of an early rock 'n' roll singer named Stag Preston , whose description would lead you to believe the character was inspired by Elvis Presley or Jerry Lee Lewis . Preston also shares some traits in common with Lonesome Rhodes , the character played by Andy Griffith in the 1957 movie A Face in the Crowd . A seemingly shy and humble country boy named Luther Sellers is discovered to have a magnificent voice and mesmerizing stage presence . He is given the stage name Stag Preston and after a short time on the `` Chittlin ' Circuit '' becomes a major rockabilly music star under the tutelage of a manager who seems to be patterned after Elvis Presley 's manager , `` Colonel '' Tom Parker . Over time Luther 's success goes to his head and his `` Aw , shucks ... '' demeanor simply becomes a gimmick used to keep his fans , who he secretly despises , believing that he has n't really left his country roots and humble upbringing . In reality Stag lives up to his stage name , using his fame and seductive powers to lure any woman he can into his bed , leaving broken hearts and scandals everywhere he goes . The latter are all tidied up by his money-grubbing manager , who does n't want anything to taint his cash cow . Meanwhile , Stag 's growing megalomania eventually has him treating everyone around him like dirt and becoming harder and harder to work with . Eventually he is entangled in a scandal that takes all their power to cover up , and sets into motion the events leading to Stag 's downfall . Much of the personality attributed to Stag Preston seems to be modeled on real rockabilly stars of the mid-to-late 1950s . Jerry Lee Lewis , who scandalized the world when he married his 13 year-old cousin only to have it later discovered that he was n't officially divorced from his ex-wife at the time seems to be a major source for the character . Though the types of scandals the Stag Preston character is involved in are of a different variety , much of the character is reminiscent of some of Lewis 's real life character traits . The description of Stag 's stage persona in the novel sounds more like Elvis Presley . Like Presley , Stag starts out as a somewhat rockabilly stylist who morphs into more of a crooner as his career progresses . Ironically , when read today , the novel also sounds eerily like an inside look at the private life of Elvis Presley . However , at the time the novel was written Presley was fresh out of the Army and his image was relatively untarnished beyond the backlash by those who had initially decried his overt sexuality and exposure of white teens to what was then euphemistically referred to as `` race music '' . It would only be after his death sixteen years later that some of the darker aspects of his personality that seem so similar to the Stag Preston character would be made public . As stated in the introduction , Stag Preston also resembles the Lonesome Rhodes character from A Face in the Crowd . In that movie , Andy Griffith portrays Larry Rhodes , an itinerant country-folk singer discovered while sleeping off a drunk in an Arkansas jail . While being recorded in his jail cell for a local radio program he is spontaneously dubbed `` Lonesome '' Rhodes by the woman who discovers him ( played by Patricia Neal ) . He becomes a local and eventually NYC-based national celebrity whose public personality of populist , corn pone humorist is a cover for the derision he feels towards both his own low origins and the gullible public who fall for his charade . Meanwhile , his ego and mistreatment of people around him grows , and he courts disaster by marrying a 17 year-old contestant from a high school majorette contest for which he goes back to Arkansas to serve as the judge .

Roberto Carlos `` Pato '' Abbondanzieri ( born Abbondancieri on August 19 , 1972 in Bouquet , Santa Fe ) is an Argentine former football goalkeeper who had a successful career at Boca Juniors . Abbondanzieri 's professional debut took place on 6 December 1994 at Santa Fe 's Rosario Central , with whom he would soon after win the 1995 CONMEBOL Cup . He played with the club until 1997 , when he moved to Boca Juniors to be the reserve goalkeeper . Abbondanzieri trained in the shadow of Ã `` scar CÃ rdoba until the Colombian goalie suffered an injury during the Clausura tournament of 1999 . However , Abbondanzieri himself then suffered a shoulder injury during a match against River Plate , and the club 's third-choice goalkeeper , Cristian MuÃ oz , took his place . When he recovered from his injury Abbondanzieri was once again CÃ rdoba 's understudy until February 2002 , when CÃ rdoba moved to Italian club Perugia . Abbondanzieri changed his name in July 2002 from Abbondancieri , a misspelling that arose at Argentinian customs when his grandfather immigrated there , to the original spelling that he uses today . The name change was prompted by Italian citizenship concerns in the case of his transfer to the European football leagues . He was named South American Goalkeeper of the Year in 2003 . Until September 2006 , when Boca achieved their third Recopa Sudamericana , he held the Boca Juniors record of 14 titles , surpassed later by Guillermo Barros Schelotto . In July 2006 , after weeks of speculation , Abbondanzieri signed a three-year contract with Spanish first division Getafe CF , claiming that `` it 's the right time for me to go to Europe '' . On April 10 , 2008 in a UEFA Cup quarterfinal second-leg match against Bayern Munich , Abbondanzieri made a vital error in extra time , as the goalkeeper failed to hold a routine ball from a distant free-kick . The ball slipped under his legs while in the six yard box , allowing Bayern striker Luca Toni to tap the ball into the back of the net . Bayern was still in deficit of goals on aggregate , as the score was 2-3 after the goal ( 3-4 on aggregate ) , but only five minutes later Bayern would level the score at 3-3 ( 4-4 on aggregate ) and allow themselves passage to the UEFA Cup semifinals via the away goals rule . Abbondanzieri continued with Getafe for the first half of the 2008-2009 season , but at his request was transferred back to Boca Juniors for the 2009 Clausura tournament . `` El Pato '' was again Boca 's number one and competed in the Clausura , although Boca only finished in 14th . He also participated in the Copa Libertadores , where Boca fell to Defensor Sporting of Uruguay in the round of 16 . On 16 February 2010 Internacional signed the Argentine goalkeeper `` Pato '' from Boca Juniors . Abbondanzieri retired on 18th December after the match against Seongnam for the third place of FIFA Club World Cup . Internacional won 4-2 . As a youth , Abbondanzieri represented Argentina in the 1989 FIFA U-17 World Championship . Since then , he became a continuous presence in Boca 's goal and , in June 2004 , he became the goalkeeper for the Argentine national team and has since played in the Copa AmÃ rica 2004 and the South American Qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup . On May 6 , 2006 , he was named as a definite squad member for the 2006 World Cup by coach JosÃ Pekerman . On 30 June 2006 , he was injured in the World Cup quarter-finals against hosts Germany , after Argentina had taken a 1-0 lead . German striker Miroslav Klose jumped up high for a header while running and collided with Abbondanzieri , with Klose 's right leg hitting the Argentinian keeper in the chest . Klose , who had looked sideways to watch for the ball in the moments leading up to the collision and thus may not have seen Abbondanzieri , received no penalty . Abbondanzieri continued at first but had to be carried off on a stretcher some minutes later , to be replaced by Leo Franco , who later failed to save Klose 's equalizing strike in the 80th minute , and the four penalty kicks in the ensuing penalty shootout , which Argentina lost 2:4 . He continued to be Argentina 's first choice goalkeeper under Alfio Basile following the 2006 World Cup . He played all six games in the 2007 Copa America in Venezuela as Argentina reached the final , only to lose to Brazil , 3-0 . He remained Basile 's goalkeeper through the early stages of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa , but was forced out injured during a 1-1 draw at home to Paraguay . By the time Abbondanzieri had recovered from his injury , Basile had been replaced by Diego Maradona as Argentina 's coach , and Maradona never selected him to the Argentina squad .

Bryology is the branch of botany concerned with the scientific study of bryophytes ( mosses , liverworts , and hornworts ) . ( Greek bryon , a moss , a liverwort ) Bryophytes were first studied in detail in the 18th century . The German botanist Johann Jacob Dillenius ( 1687-1747 ) was a professor at Oxford and in 1717 produced the work `` Reproduction of the ferns and mosses . '' The beginning of bryology really belongs to the work of Johannes Hedwig , who clarified the reproductive system of mosses ( 1792 , Fundamentum historiae naturalist muscorum ) and arranged a taxonomy . Areas of research include bryophyte taxonomy , bryophytes as bioindicators , DNA sequencing , and the interdependency of bryophytes and other plant and animal species . Among other things , scientists have learned that certain species of mosses are carnivorous . Centers of research in bryology include University of Bonn , Germany and University of Helsinki , Finland .

An orphan ( from the Greek á 1\/2 Ï Ï Î Î 1\/2 Ï Ï ) is a child permanently bereaved of his or her parents . In common usage , only a child ( or the young of an animal ) who has lost both parents is called an orphan . However , adults can also be referred to as orphans , or `` adult orphans '' . In certain animal species where the father typically abandons the mother and young at or prior to birth , the young will be called orphans when the mother dies regardless of the condition of the father . Various groups use different definitions to identify orphans . One legal definition used in the United States is a minor bereft through `` death or disappearance of , abandonment or desertion by , or separation or loss from , both parents '' . In the common use , an orphan does not have any surviving parent to care for him or her . However , the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) , Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS ( UNAIDS ) , and other groups label any child that has lost one parent as an orphan . In this approach , a maternal orphan is a child whose mother has died , a paternal orphan is a child whose father has died , and a double orphan has lost both parents . This contrasts with the older use of half-orphan to describe children that had lost only one parent . Orphans are relatively rare in developed countries , as most children can expect both of their parents to survive their childhood . Much higher numbers of orphans exist in war-torn nations such as Afghanistan . After years of war , there are an estimated 1.5 million orphans in Afghanistan . Famous orphans include world leaders such as Nelson Mandela and Andrew Jackson ; the Muslim prophet Mohammed ; writers such as Edgar Allan Poe , and Leo Tolstoy . The American orphan Henry Darger portrayed the horrible conditions of his orphanage in his art work . Other notable orphans include entertainment greats such as Louis Armstrong , Johann Sebastian Bach , Marilyn Monroe , Babe Ruth and Aaron North , and innumerable fictional characters in literature and comics . Wars and great epidemics , such as AIDS , have created many orphans . World War Two , with its massive numbers of deaths and population movements created large numbers of orphans -- with estimates for Europe ranging from 1,000,000 to 13,000,000 . Judt ( 2006 ) estimates there were 9,000 orphaned children in Czechoslovakia , 60,000 in the Netherlands 300,000 in Poland and 200,000 in Yugoslavia , plus many more in the Soviet Union , Germany , Italy and elsewhere . . Orphaned characters are extremely common as literary protagonists , especially in children 's and fantasy literature . The lack of parents leaves the characters to pursue more interesting and adventurous lives , by freeing them from familial obligations and controls , and depriving them of more prosaic lives . It creates characters that are self-contained and introspective and who strive for affection . Orphans can metaphorically search for self-understanding through attempting to know their roots . Parents can also be allies and sources of aid for children , and removing the parents makes the character 's difficulties more severe . Parents , furthermore , can be irrelevant to the theme a writer is trying to develop , and orphaning the character frees the writer from the necessity to depict such an irrelevant relationship ; if one parent-child relationship is important , removing the other parent prevents complicating the necessary relationship . All these characteristics make orphans attractive characters for authors . Orphans are common in fairy tales , such as most variants of Cinderella . A number of well-known authors have written books featuring orphans . Examples from classic literature include Charlotte BrontÃ `` , Charles Dickens , Mark Twain 's Tom Sawyer , L.M. Montgomery 's Anne of Green Gables books , and J.R.R. Tolkien . Among more recent authors , A.J. Cronin , Lemony Snicket , Roald Dahl , J.K. Rowling 's Harry Potter series , as well as some less well-known authors of famous orphans like Little Orphan Annie have used orphans as major characters . One recurring storyline has been the relationship that the orphan can have with an adult from outside his or her immediate family as seen in Lyle Kessler 's play Orphans Many books religious texts , including the Bible and the Quran , contain the idea that helping and defending orphans is a very important and God-pleasing matter . Several citations :
Girlfriend is a term that can refer to either a female partner in a non-marital romantic relationship or a female non-romantic friend that is closer than other friends . This term is often used loosely , and there is some debate over what exactly constitutes a girlfriend . In western society , it is generally agreed that `` girlfriend '' status begins when two people agree to date . Getting a girl to agree to such an arrangement is considered a milestone for young males , and is often seen as a sign of status , based on the perception of the girl amongst the male 's peers . Although nuanced , for some there is a significant difference between `` girlfriend '' ( one word ) and `` girl friend '' ( two words ) , or `` boyfriend '' ( one word ) and `` boy friend '' ( two words ) . . In a strictly grammatical sense , a `` girlfriend '' or `` boyfriend '' is an individual with whom one shares a romantic relationship . A `` girl friend '' or `` boy friend '' , however , is simply a friend identified on the basis of gender . This is sometimes also contravened by simply stating `` ladyfriend '' or `` guyfriend '' . The terms `` friend girl '' ( and `` friend boy '' ) are also sometimes used to indicate a platonic friendship . The transition between the two is a significant aspect of adolescent development . Despite this , both forms of `` girlfriend '' and `` girl friend '' are used by different people to mean different things . For example , when the term `` girlfriend '' is used by a girl or woman about another female in a non-sexual , non-romantic context , the two-word form `` girl friend '' is sometimes used to avoid confusion with the sexual or romantic meaning ; however , this is not a rule . In this sense of its usage , `` Girlfriend '' is used in terms of very close friends and has no sexual connotations , unless it is in the case of lesbian , bisexual , or pansexual women . The term `` girlfriend '' is also used in LGBT communities and can refer to people of any gender or sexuality . The term `` girlfriend '' does not necessarily imply a sexual relationship , but is often used to refer to a girl or woman who is dating a person she is not engaged to without indicating whether she is having sex with him or her . With differing expectations of sexual mores , the term dating can imply romantic activity whereas simply using `` friend '' would likely avoid implying such intimacy . It is essentially equivalent to the term `` sweetheart '' , which has also been used as a term of endearment . A similar , but not equivalent , concept is the more ambiguous `` lady friend '' -- a companion of the female gender who is possibly less than a girlfriend but potentially more than a friend . That is to say , the relationship is not necessarily platonic , nor on the other hand , is it necessarily an exclusive , serious , committed , or long-term relationship . Yet , the term also avoids the overt sexual implications that come with referring to a woman as someone 's `` mistress '' or `` lover '' . In that sense , it can often be a euphemism . Yet , this is not always the case ; it is also sometimes employed when someone simply does not know the exact status of a woman that a man has been associating with . For instance , tabloid headlines often note that a celebrity has been seen with a new `` lady friend '' . `` Lady friend '' may also be used to signify a romantic relationship with an older woman , when the term `` girl '' as in `` girlfriend '' may be deemed age-inappropriate .
A sandpit ( UK ) or sandbox ( US ) is a low , wide container or shallow depression filled with sand in which children can play . Many homeowners with children build sandpits in their backyards because , unlike much playground equipment , they can be easily and cheaply constructed . A `` sandpit '' may also denote an open pit sand mine . Sandpits encourage the imaginations and creativity of children by providing the materials and space to build structures such as sandcastles ; use toy trucks , shovels , and buckets to move the sand around ; dig holes and bury things , etc. . In other words , the sand provides a medium in which children can pretend to explore , construct , and destroy the world in three dimensions . This idea of being creative and experimentation is what the metaphorical uses of the word ` sandpit ' or ` sandbox ' were born . The `` pit '' or `` box '' itself is simply a method of storing the sand so that it does n't spread outward across lawns or other surrounding surfaces . Boxes of various shapes are often constructed from planks , logs , or other large wooden frames that allow children easy access to the sand and also provide a convenient place to sit . Nevertheless , small sandpits are also available for purchase . These are usually made from plastic and are often shaped like an animal or other familiar objects . They also sometimes have lids to cover the sand when not in use , so that passing animals can not contaminate the sand by urinating or defecating in it . Having lids also prevents the sand in outdoor sandpits from getting wet when it rains , although some dampness is often desirable as it helps the sand hold together . Prefabricated sandpits may also be used indoors , especially in day cares . Rather than sand , other materials are also often used such as oatmeal which are necessarily non-toxic and light enough to easily vacuum . Sandpits can have a solid bottom or they can be built directly onto the soil . The latter allows free draining ( which is useful if the top is open ) but can lead to some contamination of the sand with soil if the children dig down to it . The sand gets dirty over time and is eventually replaced . The old sand can be discarded or it can be used for other things ( for example , mixed into concrete ) . Some people may use ordinary building sand to fill sandpits , while others use special sandbox sand . Since it is not washed , building sand is far cheaper but often contains materials such as clay that can stain clothes . It will also contain a mixture of grain sizes and colors , and hence will have less appeal to the eye . Ordinary building sand may be strained with a sieve and washed to remove clay and particles to create a cleaner play surface . Many schools and playgrounds around North America have replaced sand around play structures with a wood chip mixture , as it is cheaper and does not stain clothing .

The 17th century was the century which lasted from 1601 to 1700 in the Gregorian calendar . The 17th century falls into the Early Modern period of Europe and in that continent was characterized by the Dutch Golden Age , the Baroque cultural movement , the French Grand SiÃ cle dominated by Louis XIV , the Scientific Revolution , and The General Crisis . This last is characterised in Europe most notably by the Thirty Years ' War , the Great Turkish War , the end of the Dutch Revolt , the disintegration of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the English Civil War . Some historians extend the scope of the General Crisis to encompass the globe , as with the demographic collapse of the Ming Dynasty , China lost approximately 30 % of its population . It was during this period also that European colonization of the Americas began in earnest , including the exploitation of the fabulously wealthy silver deposits of PotosÃ in Upper Peru and Mexico which resulted in great bouts of inflation as wealth was drawn into Europe from the rest of the world . In the midst of this global General Crisis , there were victory and triumph : In the Near East , the Ottoman , Safavid Persian and Mughal empires grew in strength . Farther east in Japan , Tokugawa Ieyasu established the Edo period at the beginning of the century , starting the isolationist Sakoku policy that was to last until the 19th century . In China , the collapsing Ming Dynasty was challenged by a series of conquests led by the Manchu warlord Nurhaci which were consolidated by his son Hong Taiji and finally consummated by his grandson , the Shunzi Emperor , founder of the Qing Dynasty . European politics during the Crisis were dominated by the France of Louis XIV , where royal power was solidified domestically in the civil war of the Fronde , in which the semi-feudal territorial French nobility was weakened and subjugated to the power of an absolute monarchy through the reinvention of the Palace of Versailles from a hunting lodge to a gilded prison in which a greatly expanded royal court could be more easily kept under surveillance . With domestic peace assured , Louis XIV caused the borders of France to be expanded to include , among other regions , Rousillon , Artois , Dunkirk , Franche-Comt Ã , Strasbourg , Alsace and Lorraine . By the end of the century , Europeans were also aware of logarithms , electricity , the telescope and microscope , calculus , universal gravitation , Newton 's Laws of Motion , air pressure and calculating machines due to the work of the first scientists of the Scientific Revolution , including Isaac Newton , Gottfried Leibniz , Galileo Galilei , RenÃ Descartes , Pierre Fermat , Robert Hooke , Robert Boyle Antonie van Leeuwenhoek and William Gilbert among other luminaries . Major changes in philosophy and science take place , often characterized as the Scientific revolution .
The legend of the tooth fairy is of a fairy who gives a child money or a gift in exchange for a baby tooth ( also known as a deciduous or milk tooth ) that has fallen out . Children typically place the tooth under their pillow at night . The fairy is said to take the tooth from under the pillow and replace it with money once they have fallen asleep . In early Europe , it was a tradition to bury baby teeth that fell out . The tradition is still very much alive and well in Ireland and Great Britain , where it is common for young children to believe in the Tooth Fairy . When a child 's sixth tooth falls out , it is customary for the tooth fairy to slip a gift or money under the child 's pillow , but to leave the tooth as a reward for the child growing strong . Rosemary Wells , a former professor at the Northwestern University Dental School , found evidence that supports the origin of different tooth fairies in the United States around 1900 . Folklorist Tad Tuleja suggests postwar affluence , a child-directed family culture , and media turned the myth into a custom . The custom of leaving monetary gifts after teeth are lost varies grossly in amount left and depends entirely on socioeconomic status of the homeowner . Recent surveys published in the American Dental Association 's monthly publication , `` Ortho '' shows that the average value received by children for deciduous teeth is US$ 1.00 \/ tooth , and ranges from US$ 0.25 to US$ 20.00 . The largest gift was reported by a responder in Manhattan for a gift in the amount of US$ 1.2 million and included a sliding scale for each subsequent tooth lost . The ADA survey summary stated that the `` per tooth '' amount was found by surveying over 2 million children in the US during 2010 and includes a multiplier of 1.5 x for each additional tooth in the event the child saves their teeth for future offerings under a pillow - presumably to encourage savings at a young age . Permanent teeth lost through natural means ( as opposed to surgical extraction ) are much rarer , and therefore commonly command a much larger gift . The most recent studies on permanent teeth gift amounts were done in 1995 , and stood at US$ 150.00 \/ tooth . The inflation adjusted amount in today 's dollars would amount to US$ 216.52 . Dr. Wells created a Tooth Fairy Museum in 1993 in her home in Deerfield , Illinois . The Tooth Fairy Museum remained open approximately 17 years and had many visitors a year . It closed and the collection was disbursed after her death in 2000 .
Several of the Carlist pretenders to the Spanish throne were also known as Don Carlos . Carlos , Prince of Asturias , also known as Don Carlos ( 8 July 1545 -- 24 July 1568 ) , was the eldest son and heir of King Philip II of Spain . His mother was Maria Manuela of Portugal , daughter of John III of Portugal . Carlos was mentally unstable and was imprisoned by his father in early 1568 , dying after half a year of solitary confinement . His fate was a theme in Spain 's Black Legend , and inspired a play by Friedrich Schiller and an opera by Giuseppe Verdi . Carlos was born at Valladolid , and his mother died a month after his birth . The young Infante Carlos was delicate and deformed . He grew up proud and willful and , as a young adult , began to show signs of mental instability . Many of his physical and psychological afflictions may have stemmed from the inbreeding common to the House of Habsburg and the royal houses of Portugal and Spain . Carlos had only four great-grandparents instead of the maximum of eight , and his parents had the same coefficient of coancestry ( 1\/8 ) as if they were half siblings . He had only six great-great-grandparents , instead of the maximum 16 ; his maternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were brother and sister , his maternal grandfather and his paternal grandmother were also brother and sister , and his two great-grandmothers were sisters . In 1559 Prince Carlos was betrothed to Elizabeth of Valois , eldest daughter of King Henry II of France . However , for political reasons , she instead married King Philip in 1560 . Three other brides were then suggested for the Prince : Mary , Queen of Scots ; Margaret of Valois , youngest daughter of Henry II of France ; and Anna of Austria , who was to later become Philip 's fourth wife , and was a daughter of Philip 's cousin , the Emperor Maximilian II . Carlos was recognized in 1560 as the heir to the Castilian throne , and three years later as heir to the Crown of Aragon as well . He became also the 218th Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece . He often attended meetings of the Council of State ( which dealt with foreign affairs ) and was in correspondence with the Netherlands regent , Margaret of Parma . In 1562 Carlos fell down a flight of stairs , which caused serious head injuries . His life was saved by a trepanation of the skull , performed by the eminent anatomist Andreas Vesalius . After his recovery , Carlos became wild and unpredictable in his behavior . He took a dislike to the Duke of Alba , who became the commander of Philip 's forces in the Netherlands , a position that had been promised to Carlos . Carlos possibly made contacts with representative of the Count Egmont from the Low Countries , who was leading the revolt against the Spanish . He also exhibited an antipathy towards his father , whose murder , according to Carlos ' confessor , he supposedly contemplated at one time . In the autumn of 1567 he made preparations to flee to the Netherlands . However , Don Juan de Austria revealed these plans to King Philip . In January 1568 Don Carlos was arrested and placed in solitary confinement on his father 's orders . He died in isolation six months later . It was later claimed that he was poisoned on the orders of King Philip , especially by William the Silent in his Apology , a 1581 propaganda work against the Spanish king . Modern historians think that Don Carlos died of natural causes . He grew very thin and developed eating disorders during his imprisonment , alternating self-starvation with heavy binges . The idea of King Philip confining and murdering his own son later played a minor role in establishing the anti-Spanish Black Legend . It also formed the basis for Friedrich Schiller 's 1787 tragedy Don Karlos , Infant von Spanien ; Schiller 's play was adapted into several operas , most notably Giuseppe Verdi 's Don Carlos . The story of a king jailing his own son is also the basis for the Spanish play La vida es sueÃ o ( Life Is a Dream ) ( 1635 ) , by Pedro CalderÃ n de la Barca ; however , this play does not explicitly refer to Don Carlos .
Developers of non-Tekken games have commented on the series . Tekken 2 is the second installment in the popular Tekken fighting game series . It was first released in arcades in 1995 , and later released for the PlayStation in 1996 . It was re-released in Tekken 5 's Arcade History mode for the PlayStation 2 , in 2007 for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable via the PlayStation Network , and in 2009 for Zeebo via ZeeboNet .

It continues to use 2D backgrounds in its stages , features an infinite playing field , and uses a fighting system that utilizes four buttons : left punch , right punch , left kick , and right kick . Distinct additions included attack reversals for some characters , back throws , chain-throws , and a sidestep unique to one character , Kazuya Mishima . Tackles were also modified to inflict damage when running from a greater distance . Each time the game is beaten with one of the default available characters in arcade mode , the associated sub-boss character becomes selectable . Two years have passed since the King of the Iron Fist Tournament . On a stormy night , a lone figure fights his way up a rocky cliff until he reaches the top . The Mishima Zaibatsu , under the leadership of Kazuya Mishima , has become even more corrupt and powerful than ever before , as well as becoming involved in many illegal operations . These include kidnapping , extortion , smuggling of endangered species for illegal experiments , and blackmail . Unknown to everyone , Kazuya is being backed up by a mysterious force known as Devil , who inhabits Kazuya 's body and serves as his only counsel . Kazuya 's activities have made enemies for him from all corners of the world , one of which is Jun Kazama , an animal rights activist . Kazuya 's biggest problem , however , is when news reaches his ears that his father , Heihachi Mishima ( whom he defeated two years ago in the first King of the Iron Fist Tournament ) is alive and plotting revenge against him . In an attempt to rid himself of Heihachi and his enemies once and for all , Kazuya announces the King of the Iron Fist Tournament 2 , with a cash prize one thousand times the first ( one trillion dollars ) . Jun Kazama eventually comes face to face with Kazuya , but rather than arresting him , she finds herself drawn to him . She later ends up pregnant , with Kazuya being the father . In the confusion , she departs from the tournament . In the final round , Heihachi confronts Kazuya , and they battle once again . Heihachi wins the first round , prompting Devil to take over Kazuya 's body and unleash his full power . This results with Kazuya becoming a Devil-like creature . Despite his advantages , Devil is still defeated by Heihachi , and flees the unconscious body of Kazuya . After the tournament , Devil attempts to inhabit the body of Jun 's unborn son , but Jun manages to fight him off . Heihachi , meanwhile , takes Kazuya 's body to a volcano , and drops him in . Heihachi then escapes on a helicopter as the volcano erupts behind him , having finally taken his revenge and regained his company . Tekken 2s port to the PlayStation is considered to be vastly superior in content to its arcade counterpart . Aside from unique CGI endings for every character , it featured numerous modes such as Survival , Time Attack , Team Battle , and a Practice Mode . It also contained remixed music , like the port of the first game . The PlayStation 2 version of Tekken 5 features the arcade version of Tekken 2 ( Ver .

Zittau is a city in the south east of the Free State of Saxony , Germany , close to the border tripoint of Germany , Poland , and the Czech Republic . As of 2009 , there are 28,638 people in the city . It is part of the GÃ rlitz district . The inner city of Zittau still shows its original beauty with many houses out of several areas of German architecture . There is the famous town hall in an Italian style , the church of St. John and the stables ( Salzhaus ) with its medieval heritage . This multistoried building is one of the oldest of its kind in Germany . Zittau was one of the six members of the Six-City League of Upper Lusatia . At that time the city got a special title - it was called `` Die Reiche '' ( `` the Rich '' ) according to its proportion of well-to-do citizens . During the Counterreformation and after 1620 after the battle at Weisser Berg ( White Mountain ) a large number of Protestant refugees from Bohemia ( bÃ hmische Exulanten ) came to Zittau , where the Protestant Saxon rulers took them in . Many of them went on and found refuge in surrounding villages , in Dresden and in Berlin in Brandenburg . Primarily due to near-complete war destruction during the Seven Years ' War the once superior well-to do situation is only reflected in few extraordinary buildings and the rich cemeteries of the city . One of the most important trading goods of this early age in the 16th century was beer . Later in the 18th and 19th century textiles became important too , a tradition common in the region of Upper-Lusatia . During World War II , a labor camp was located in the city . It provided forced labor for Schoenmann Werke , an aircraft parts manufacturer . After the reunification in 1990 most of the big textile-enterprises that survived the time of the GDR nearly without any changes and any further investment closed down in just a few years . The city lost most of its economical strength . In addition , lignite surface mining was discontinued on the outskirts of the city in the foothills of the Zittau Mountains , while it still goes on across the border in Poland . This , however , has saved parts of the city from sure destruction , yet primarily now dormant military garrisons and schools . The city is also disadvantaged by the cheaper labor from neighbouring countries . There are roughly 3,500 students studying at the Zittau\/G Ã rlitz University of Applied Sciences and at the independent International Graduate School , Germany 's smallest university catering to students from nearby Poland and the Czech Republic . Because of its missing link to good infrastructure the city still suffers , but a direct connection to the nearest motorway between Bautzen and GÃ rlitz is planned . Zittau is located near the tripoint where the Czech Republic , Germany and Poland meet and there are several border checkpoints between the three countries . Immigration and customs checks have however been removed since December 21 , 2007 , when all three acceded to the Schengen Area . Zittau is the only city along the Oder-Neisse line where six existing border bridges connecting Germany and Poland are still closed although both countries are members of the Schengen area .

He made his first international appearance on December 22 , 1980 in a World Cup qualifier against Singapore in Hong Kong . He scored his first international goal on September 20 , 1986 in an Asian Games match against Nepal in Daejeon , South Korea . He was a member of the Japan team that won the 1992 AFC Asian Cup . He played all the Japan games except one for which he was n't eligible due to suspension . He was such a key player that national coach Hans Ooft named him a member of the Japan squad for the AFC 's final qualifying stage for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in spite of his injury . However , he could not play any game in the competition that was centrally held in Doha , Qatar as his recovery was n't as good as Ooft had wished it to be . Japan 's hope to qualify for the finals was dashed by a stoppage time Iraqi equaliser in the last qualifying match . The Japanese fans now refer to this match as the Agony of Doha , and his absence was one of the main reasons why Japan 's campaign ended up unsuccessful . After finishing his playing career , Tsunami worked as a pundit on television and as a coach at Tokyo Verdy 's youth setup . He acquired the S-Class Coaching License that was a prerequisite to manage a J. League club in 2004 . In 2005 , he was appointed the manager of J. League Division 2 side Vegalta Sendai . Vegalta finished fourth and failed to gain the promotion . Tsunami was dismissed after one season . In 2006 , he became an assistant coach to new manager Ruy Ramos at another J2 side Tokyo Verdy . Again the team failed to move up and he was sacked after one season . In 2007 , he became the manager of newly relegated J2 side Cerezo Osaka but was dismissed in May after a bad start . In 2008 , he was appointed as the manager of Division 2 club Yokohama FC but was fired at the end of the 2008 season .
In Greek mythology , Scylla ( ; , Skylla ) was a monster that lived on one side of a narrow channel of water , opposite its counterpart Charybdis . The two sides of the strait were within an arrow 's range of each otherâ '' so close that sailors attempting to avoid Charybdis would pass too close to Scylla and vice versa . Scylla was a horrible sea monster with four eyes , six long necks equipped with grisly heads , each of which contained three rows of sharp teeth . Her body consisted of twelve tentacle-like legs and a cat 's tail and with four to six dog-heads ringing her waist . She was one of the children of Phorcys and Ceto . Some sources , including Stesichorus , cite her parents as Triton and Lamia . Traditionally the strait has been associated with the Strait of Messina between Italy and Sicily , but more recently this theory has been challenged , and the alternative location of Cape Skilla in northwest Greece has been suggested by Tim Severin . The phrase `` between Scylla and Charybdis '' ( popularly reworded `` between a rock and a hard place '' ) has come to mean being in a state where one is between two dangers and moving away from one will cause you to be in danger from the other . In Homer 's Odyssey XII , Odysseus is given advice by Circe to sail closer to Scylla , for Charybdis could drown his whole ship : `` Hug Scylla 's cragâ '' sail on past herâ '' top speed ! Better by far to lose six men and keep your ship than lose your entire crew '' she warns and tells Odysseus to bid Crataeis prevent her from pouncing more than once . Odysseus then successfully sails his ship past Scylla and Charybdis , but Scylla manages to catch six of his men , devouring them alive : : : '' ... they writhedgasping as Scylla swung them up her cliff and thereat her cavern 's mouth she bolted them down rawâ '' screaming out , flinging their arms toward me , lost in that mortal struggle . '' According to Ovid , Scylla was once a beautiful nymph . The fisherman-turned-sea-god Glaucus fell madly in love with her , but she fled from him onto the land where he could not follow . Despair filled his heart . He went to the sorceress Circe to ask for a love potion to melt Scylla 's heart . As he told his tale of love about Scylla to Circe , she herself fell in love with him . She wooed him with her sweetest words and looks , but the sea-god would have none of her . Circe was furious , but with Scylla and not with Glaucus . She prepared a vial of very powerful poison and poured it in the pool where Scylla bathed . As soon as the nymph entered the water , she was transformed into a frightful monster with twelve feet and six heads , each with three rows of teeth . Angry , growling wolf heads grew from her waist , and she tried to brush them off . She stood there in utter misery , unable to move , loathing and destroying everything that came into her reach , a peril to all sailors who passed near her . Whenever a ship passed , each of her heads would seize one of the crew . Scylla is rationalised in the Aeneid as a dangerous rock outcropping . In a late Greek myth , it was said that Heracles encountered Scylla during a journey to Sicily and slew her . Her father , the sea-god Phorcys , then applied flaming torches to her body and restored her to life . According to John Tzetzes and Servius ' commentary on the Aeneid , Scylla was a beautiful naiad who was claimed by Poseidon , but the jealous Amphitrite turned her into a monster by poisoning the water of the spring where Scylla would bathe . A similar story is found in Hyginus : according to him , Scylla was the daughter of the river god Crateis and was loved by Glaucus , but Glaucus himself was also loved by Circe . When Scylla was bathing in the sea , the jealous Circe poured some potion into the sea water , which caused Scylla to transform into a monster . The fact that Scylla devoured some of Odysseus ' companions is thus regarded as an act of her revenge on Circe , considering that Odysseus too was loved by the sorceress . At the Carolingian abbey of Corvey in Lower Saxony , a unique ninth-century wall painting depicts , among other things , Odysseus ' fight with Scylla , an illustration not noted elsewhere in medieval arts . The character of Sin from John Milton 's Paradise Lost is similar to Homer 's description of Scylla . Scylla and Charybdis are actually mentioned at one point in the poem . In James Joyce 's Ulysses , paralleling the Odyssey , the `` Scylla and Charybdis '' episode takes place in the National Library of Ireland in Kildare Street , Dublin .
WPST ( 94.5 FM ) is a radio station broadcasting a Hot Adult Contemporary format . Licensed to Trenton , New Jersey , USA , the station serves the Philadelphia , Middlesex-Somerset-Union area . The station is currently owned by Nassau Broadcasting Ii , LLC and features programing from Westwood One . The transmitter is located in Fairless Hills , Pennsylvania , on US-1 . 94.5 in Trenton began on August 7 , 1965 as WCHR with a religious format . But after 33 years , that all changed when Nassau Broadcasting bought the station . November 10 , 1997 saw the beginning of things to come when WCHR began to simulcast on 920 AM in Trenton ( see NJ AM Page 4 ) in preparation for a format change . On February 27 , 1998 , WCHR started stunting with construction sound effects and on March 2 , 1998 94.5 became `` New Jersey 's Oldies Station . '' The WNJO calls were assigned on March 26 , 1998 . On November 1 , 2001 , WNJO switched to a classic hits format as `` 94.5 The Hawk . '' Calls changed to WTHK on August 1 , 2002 - and slowly evolved into a classic rock station . On February 14 , 2005 , at 5pm , 94.5 `` switched '' frequencies and formats with 97.5 WPST . Forming 94.5 `` PST '' `` number one for today 's hit music '' . Matt Sneed ( current MD ) was the first voice on 94.5 WPST , while Chris Puorro was music director and Dave McKay was program director at the time . 97.5 started life , initially on January 10 , 1949 , then officially on April 19 , 1949 , as WTOA . It was owned by the Mercer Broadcasting Company , which was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Trenton Times newspaper . WTOA started out broadcasting from 3pm to 11pm , with an ERP of 14,500 watts . Its original coverage area reached as far north as Brooklyn , New York and as far west as Reading , Pennsylvania . 97.5 became WPST on September 13 , 1971 . The WPST calls originally stood for `` Passport Stereo Trenton , '' a slogan of the station at the time . Also , the WPST calls were on a Miami TV station now known as WPLG . WPST is known for its mainstream CHR format , which they 've had for many years . Tom Taylor was the PD who launched the format in the mid 1970s , and did mornings on the station until 1987 . In August 1975 , owner Herb Hobler hired Phil Gieger as the General Manager . Along with Tom Taylor , they revamped the station and coined the phrase , `` From The Shore To The Poconos , The Best Music Is On The FM 97.5 WPST .

Parkhead is a district in the East End of Glasgow . Its name comes from a small weaving hamlet at the meeting place of the Great Eastern Road ( now the Gallowgate and Tollcross Road ) and Westmuir Street . Duke Street and Springfield Road also meet there , to form a turreted Edwardian five-way junction at Parkhead Cross . Glasgow 's Eastern Necropolis was laid out in 1847 beside the Gallowgate . The area flourished with the discovery of coal in 1837 and grew into an industrial center . In 1897 William Beardmore and Company became famous with the production of high grade steel at the local Parkhead Forge , founded about 1837 and extended between 1884 and 1914 . After years of decline , the massive plant was closed in 1976 , and in 1986 the construction of the first phase of The Forge Shopping Centre began on the site . The shopping center opened in the autumn of 1988 , and in 1994 an indoor market was added adjacent to it . The final element , a retail park , was completed in three stages between 1996 and 2002 . Belvidere Hospital , built on the Belvidere estate which extended from London Road to the Clyde , originally consisted of wooden huts thrown up rapidly when the city 's older fever hospital at Parliamentary Road was overwhelmed by a typhus epidemic in 1870 . A self-contained smallpox hospital of five brick pavilions was built from 1874 . After this nineteen pavilions of red and white striped brick were set up for the fever hospital . In recent times , with the general closure of infectious disease hospitals , care of elderly people became its main function before closing in 1999 . Parkhead Hospital , which opened in November 1988 , was said to be the only new psychiatric hospital to be built in Scotland in the 20th century . ( However , some 18th and 19th century institutions did move to new buildings during the 20th century . ) It was built on part of the old forge land , next to the Parkhead Health Centre , and replaced the psychiatric and psycho-geriatric admission wards of both Duke Street Hospital ( formerly known as the Eastern District Hospital ) and Gartloch Hospital . Both units moved into the new hospital on the day of a Rangers-Celtic match at the nearby Celtic Park . Parkhead also has one of Glasgow 's original Carnegie libraries , deftly designed in the Edwardian Baroque style by James Robert Rhind . Parkhead is however best known as the home of Celtic Football Club . Celtic Park , opened in 1892 after the club moved across the road from their old ground which they had been playing on for their first three years . A journalist covering the event reported that it was like `` moving from the graveyard to paradise '' hence the nickname `` Paradise . '' Celtic Park is located at 95 , Kerrydale Street , just off the London Road in Parkhead . The stadium itself is commonly referred to as Parkhead because of its location . The red brick South Stand built in 1929 had the same architect as the similar structure at the Ibrox Park of `` Old Firm '' rivals Rangers . Parkhead FC before its dissolution was arguably the most successful Scottish junior side . There have been several railway stations in Parkhead .

The club , formed in 1974 by Assyrian immigrants , has advanced through the league system and is currently playing in the second highest Swedish league , Superettan . They played in the highest Swedish football league Allsvenskan in 2005 . The club has also played a final in Svenska Cupen , which was lost against Elfsborg in 2003 . Assyriska is often viewed as a substitute national team by the Assyrian people . Their games in Allsvenskan were broadcast to over 80 countries . The club has also their own pop song which is called `` My Assyrian team â `` the team of my dream '' . A documentary film about Assyriska called `` Assyriska : A National Team Without A Nation '' was also made in 2006 by Nuri Kino and Erik Sandberg . The success of the documentary film made it possible to win the Golden Palm Award at the Beverly Hills Film Festival . Assyriska FÃ reningen was founded in 1971 by Assyrian refugees from Turkey who belonged to the Syriac Orthodox Church . Three years later , a football team was started and played its first season in the lowest league in 1975 . They advanced through the divisions and reached the second highest league , Division 1 ( today replaced by Superettan ) , in 1992 , as the first immigrant team ever . The team was however relegated in 1993 , and the next few years , the club played every second year in Division 1 before managing to stay there for more than one season in 1997 . They lost a promotion play-off against Ã -- rebro SK in 1999 , but five years later , in 2004 , Assyriska was promoted to Allsvenskan , the highest league , for the first time as Ã -- rebro SK was relegated due to economical problems . However Assyriska were themselves relegated after only one season in the Allsvenskan , where they finished last . Since then Assyriska had fallen into Division 1 North , but enjoyed a strong season in 2007 to finish champions and were promoted back into the Superettan . At the close of the 2009 season Assyriska , having held off the challenge of rivals Syrianska FC to finish third in the Superettan table , faced DjurgÃ rdens IF in a play-off for a place in the Allsvenskan in 2010 . Assyriska won the first match at home 2-0 but were overcome 3-0 after extra time in the repeat . In season 2010 , Assyriska finished 4th in the Superettan . However 2010 was a season marred for Assyriska by the murder of player Eddie Moussa . Assyriska promotes the development of young players and Assyriska FF Ungdom who play in Division 3 form an integral part of the club . The club is affiliated to the SÃ dermanlands FotbollfÃ rbund . Assyriska 's fans are spread throughout the world in over 80 countries . Acting as their national team , Assyriska represents the entire population of Assyrians throughout the world . The Zelge Fans are the official fanclub of Assyriska FÃ reningen . They were first started 1993 by a group of Assyriska supporters in SÃ dertÃ lje . They were known as Neshre , which means eagle ( or eagles ) in Syriac . Three months after they launched , the club changed its name to Zelge Fans , Zelge meaning `` sun rays '' in Syriac . The sun rays are a symbol of the Assyrian flag , which is where the idea to name the fan club Zelge Fans came from . Most of the members are Assyrians , but the Zelge fanclub also has many Swedish members . Assyriska 's fans are also growing in numbers as a result of the internet . During its early years , Assyriska did not have the mass means of communication to be able to spread their team information consistently to other mass Assyrian areas ( Chicago , Toronto , California , etc ) . With the tech age , Assyriska has been able to spread its fan base outside of SÃ dertÃ lje and become known in over 80 countries . Assyriska has become a true symbol for Assyrians traveling to Sweden . Many make it their goal to watch an Assyriska match at least once when they travel to Sweden . As of 10 January 2010 .
The Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra ( Serbian : Ð ` Ð Ð 3\/4 Ð Ñ Ð Ð Ñ Ð Ð Ñ Ð Ð '' Ñ Ð Ñ Ð 1\/4 Ð 3\/4 Ð 1\/2 Ð Ñ Ð \/ Beogradska filharmonija ) is an orchestra in Serbia , regularly considered as one of the finest in the country . Its home base is in Belgrade . Unlike most European countries and cities Serbia and Belgrade were rather late in receiving a fine orchestra . Thus the Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra was founded in 1923 . Its founder , first director and chief conductor was Stevan HristiÄ , one of the most important Serbian composers and conductors . The inauguration concert of the Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra took place on April 28 , 1923 under the baton of maestro HristiÄ . With a steady increase in popularity for fine music in Serbia the orchestra and its program exapnded over the years building up to an exceptional level of musical performance reaching its peak in the 1960s . The Belgrade Philharmonic was ranked 5th best European orchestra by international experts , at the time when it was led by Å 1\/2 ivojin ZdravkoviÄ . The downfall of the orchestra occurred in 1990 . Due to the civil wars in Yugoslavia the Belgrade Philharmonic was banned to play internationally for some time . As a consequence many musicians left the orchestra . Without funding , the orchestra rarely played . However as the political situation in Serbia changed and the country welcomed back into the international community so was the orchestra . After 2000 the orchestra was completely revived . It first toured Slovenia , Austria , Italy and Sweden . Young musicians , educated outside of Serbia in specialist musician centres arrived in at Belgrade Philharmonic creating a new image of the Orchestra , with an average age of just 28 . In 2004 the performance hall in Belgrade was completely rebuilt and modernize to facilitate the new needs of the orchestra . The hall has a total of 201 seats . Most of the concerts , by tradition , take place in the Ilija M. Kolarac Endowment 's Hall , while the central Hall is used for special events . The Belgrade Philharmonic Foundation was set up in 2004 to improve the financial situation within the orchestra through sponsorships and cooperation . The foundation was successes and the whole orchestra renewed their instruments in 2005 . Currently the Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra holds multiple concerts . Its season generally starts in October and ends in June . Its New Year 's concert is very popular and is held in the large Sava Centar performance hall in Belgrade . For its New Year 's concert , the orchestra is usually conducted by a special guest . The Belgrade Philharmonic Hall is modernly equipped , located in central Belgrade . Therefore this is where many of the Orchestra 's concerts are held . Besides usual orchestra rehearsals , the Belgrade Philharmonic Hall lends itself to soloist 's , chamber and other orchestra 's performances , as well as to promotions , presentations , jubilees and exhibitions . The hall has exceptional acoustics . The appealing interior of the Belgrade Philharmonic Hall attracts numerous renowned companies to promote their products , present their services , as well as to hold their jubilees . Among those there were the American Economic Chamber , and companies like Roche , Pharma Swiss , Common Sense , `` Atika Media '' and many others . The Belgrade Philharmonic Hall was is the setting for many commercials and videos . The Orchestra was consequently led by eminent conductors : Lovro MataÄ iÄ , Oskar Danon , Mihajlo VukdragoviÄ , KreÅ imir BaranoviÄ , Å 1\/2 ivojin ZdravkoviÄ , Angel Å urev , Anton Kolar , Horst Ferster , Jovan Å ajnoviÄ , Vassily Sinaisky , Emil Tabakov , UroÅ Lajovic , Dorian Wilson and from September 2010 Muhai Tang .

Tarbela Dam on the Indus River in Pakistan is the sixteenth largest dam in the world . It is located in Haripur District , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , about 50 k northwest of Islamabad . The dam is 485 f high above the riverbed . The dam forms the Tarbela Reservoir , with a surface area of approximately 250 k. The dam was completed in 1974 and was designed to store water from the Indus River for irrigation , flood control , and the generation of hydroelectric power . The project is located at a narrow spot in the Indus River valley , at Tarbela in Haripur , shortly located at the point from where the District Swabi starts . Here the river formerly split around a large island close to the left bank . The main dam wall , built of earth and rock fill , stretches 2743 m from the island to river right , standing 148 m high . A pair of concrete auxiliary dams spans the river from the island to river left . The spillways , located on the auxiliary dams , in turn consist of two parts . The main spillway has a discharge capacity of 18406 m and the auxiliary spillway , 24070 m. The outlet works are a group of four tunnels that have been cut through the valley wall at river right , for uses of hydropower generation and flow control . These tunnels were originally used to divert the Indus River while the dam was being constructed . The fifth river outlet is situated on the left side of the dam and was completed in April 1976 . People from Hazara division living across river Indus gave sacrifices and left their lands and homes for the sake of dam construction . These people are now settled by government of Pakistan in Khala Butt Township Haripur , Pakistan . A hydroelectric power plant on the right side of the main dam houses 14 generators fed with water from outlet tunnels 1 , 2 , and 3 . There are four 175 MW generators on tunnel 1 , six 175 MW generators on tunnel 2 , and four 432 MW generators on tunnel 3 , for a total generating capacity of 3,478 MW . Tarbela Reservoir is 80.5 k long , with a surface area of 250 k. The reservoir holds 11600000 a of water , with a live storage of 9700000 a. The catchment area upriver of the Tarbela Dam is spread over 168000 k of land largely supplemented by snow and glacier melt from the southern slopes of the Himalayas . There are two main Indus River tributaries upstream of the Tarbela Dam . These are the Shyok River , joining near Skardu , and the Siran River near Tarbela . The Tarbela Dam is the third largest in terms of dam volume in the world . It has a reservoir area of about 260 square kilometers and about 82,000 acres land was acquired for its construction . The large reservoir of the dam submerged 135 villages , which resulted in displacement of a population of about 96,000 people . For the land and built-up property acquired under the Land Acquisition Act of 1984 , a cash compensation of Rs 469.65 million was paid to the affectees . In the absence of a national policy , resettlement concerns of the affectees of Tarbela Dam were addressed on ad hoc basis . Because the source of the Indus River is glacial meltwater from the Himalayas , the river carries huge amounts of sediment . The annual suspended sediment load is about 430 million tons per year . This means that , over time , the reservoir will fill . The useful life of the dam and reservoir was estimated to be somewhere around fifty years , since the dam 's completion in 1976 , meaning that the reservoir would have been full of sediment by 2030 . However , sedimentation has been much lower than predicted , and it is now estimated that the useful lifespan of the dam will be 85 years , to about 2060 .

`` Getting Better '' is a song written mainly by Paul McCartney , with lyrical contributions from John Lennon , credited to Lennon\/McCartney . It was recorded by The Beatles for the 1967 album Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . The song , musically reminiscent of the hit single `` Penny Lane '' , moves forward by way of regular chords , produced by Lennon 's guitar , McCartney 's electric piano , and George Martin , who struck the strings of a pianette with a mallet . These heavily accented and repetitive lines cause the song to sound as if it is based on a drone . Lead guitarist George Harrison adds an Indian tambura part to the final verse , which further accentuates this impact . The song 's title and music suggest optimism , but some of the song 's lyrics have a more negative tone . In this sense , it reflects the contrasting personas of the two songwriters . In response to McCartney 's line , `` It 's getting better all the time '' , Lennon replies , `` It ca n't get no worse ! '' Referring to the lyric `` I used to be cruel to my woman\/I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved\/Man I was mean but I 'm changing my scene\/And I 'm doing the best that I can '' , Lennon admitted that he had done things in relationships in the past that he was not happy about . According to Hunter Davies , the initial idea for the song 's title came from a phrase often spoken by Jimmie Nicol , the group 's stand-in drummer for the Australian leg of a 1964 tour . One of the recording sessions for `` Getting Better '' is famous for an incident involving Lennon . During the 21 March 1967 session in which producer George Martin added a piano solo to Lovely Rita , Lennon complained that he did not feel well and could not focus . He had accidentally taken LSD when he meant to take an upper . Unaware of the mistake , Martin took him up to the roof of Abbey Road Studio for some fresh air , and returned to Studio Two where McCartney and Harrison were waiting . They knew why Lennon was not well , and upon hearing where Lennon was , rushed to the roof to retrieve him and prevent a possible accident .

Lanark Grammar School is a secondary school in Lanark , Scotland . It was founded in 1183 , and celebrated its octocentenary in 1983 , including a visit by Princess Anne . Notable former pupils include rally driver Colin McRae and General William Roy , a contributor to the Ordnance Survey project . The school draws its pupils from the town of Lanark and many villages in the local area , including Douglas , Carstairs , Forth and Glespin . The school has 5 houses : Lockhart , Jerviswood , Wallace , Hyndford and Braxfield and pupils are sorted into these by tutor group upon the first day of term . There are 94.2 teachers ( FTE ) and 1018 students . Lanark Grammar School has a long history , being over 800 years old . Over the years , it has been housed in many buildings . The town 's Parish Church was used as the first school house . Until 1893 , Lanark Grammar was a fee-paying school and until 1884 it was for boys only . From its beginnings in the Parish Church , the school would usually have only two teachers at a time until 1884 . The only recorded exception to this was in the 1770s when Robert Thomson is reported to have a second assistant . The Bloomgate building was the first building specifically erected for use as Lanark Grammar School . It was built in the 15th century and stood on the site of what is now the Clydesdale Hotel . The exact year in which the school was built is currently unknown . For a short spell in the 19th century , the Lanark Horsemarket was the home of Lanark Grammar . There are few records available related to this site . The Hyndford Road building was opened in August 1884 . This building was large enough to accommodate both girls and boys , and Lanark Grammar School became a co-educational facility . On Friday , 18 February 1888 , the school `` went up in flames '' and was therefore closed . Students were displaced to temporary accommodation while the school was rebuilt . Work was complete by the end of the summer holidays in the same year . During reconstruction , the school was expanded with room for ninety pupils of primary school age . The building was in use up until December 2003 . The Albany Drive building was opened on Wednesday 16 September 1914 . It was in use for just over 95 years when it was closed on Tuesday 22 December 2009 . There was a fire in the building on the morning of 31 January 2007 , in the boy 's toilets . The building was evacuated and periods 3 and 4 were canceled . The toilets were destroyed and had to be refurbished ( which meant the only boy 's toilets on site were out of use for several months - pupils were sent to the facilities in the extension building . Unlike the fire on the Hyndford Road campus , however , there was no serious damage to the building and students returned to their classes period 5 on the same day . This school was built by South Lanarkshire Council under their School Modernisation initiative . The School Modernisation program was started with the intention of modernizing teaching facilities in the county . Many schools , including Robert Owen Memorial Primary School and Carluke High School have already been rebuilt as part of this program . Prior to the project , many school buildings were becoming unsafe and others had been built when class sizes were much larger . Once complete , all schools in the area will have a similar design and will have facilities of the same standard . The Lanark Grammar Project was completed between August and December 2009 , however pupils and staff moved to the new building in January 2010 in order to minimize disruption as resources could be moved and unpacked during the holiday period . Staff returned to the building on Tuesday 5 January 2010 . Pupils returned as follows : Lanark Grammar now also contains an ASN wing in which pupils who have special teaching requirements can be educated . This has allowed for the integration of Lanark Grammar School with the pupils and staff of Craighead and Victoria Park , two special needs secondary schools . The school now has several other new facilities . In 2004 Lanark Grammar School was inspected by HMIe and received mostly positive criticism . Its key strengths included : The school is due to be inpected by HMIe during the term which begins August 2010 and ends June 2011 . The pupils of Lanark Grammar School actively raise money for charity . Most notable is their regular contributions to two orphaned children in Kenya . As well as paying the children 's school fees , Lanark Grammar also gives money to the local community which in the past has bought cows , new roofs for run-down houses and water storage tanks . This project is organised through Direct Link . Every year , the majority of S1 pupils do a sponsored climb up Tinto , raising money for St Andrews Hospice . Senior students in S5\/6 take part in a sponsored run around Strathclyde Park ( approx . 10k ) for the same cause . The following is a table showing the achievements of the relevant September S4 role in the 2007\/08 session . It shows the percentage of the year group achieving qualifications at the given levels :

Nicholas Yonge ( ca . 1560 -- buried 23 October 1619 ) was an English singer and publisher . He is most famous for publishing the Musica transalpina ( 1588 ) , a collection of Italian madrigals with their words translated into English . This proved to be explosively popular , beginning ( or fueling ) a vogue for madrigal composing and singing in England which lasted into the first two decades of the 17th century . Indeed , William Heather , founder of the music chair at Oxford University , included the book in his portrait , painted c. 1627 , confirming the longevity of Musica transalpina 's influence and popularity . Musica transalpina contains 57 separate pieces by 18 composers , with Alfonso Ferrabosco ( the elder ) having the most , and Luca Marenzio second most . Ferrabosco was living in England until 1578 , which could explain the large number of his compositions in the book ; he was relatively unknown in Italy . In 1597 Yonge published a second book ( Musica transalpina : the Second Booke of Madrigalles , ... translated out of Sundrie Italian Authors ) . Composers such as John Wilbye and Thomas Weelkes used the pieces in both collections as models for their work .

Year 13 ( XIII ) was a common year starting on Sunday ( link will display the full calendar ) of the Julian calendar . At the time , it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Silius and Plancus ( or , less frequently , year 766 Ab urbe condita ) . The denomination 13 for this year has been used since the early medieval period , when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years .
A spruce is a tree of the genus Picea , a genus of about 35 species of coniferous evergreen trees in the Family Pinaceae , found in the northern temperate and boreal ( taiga ) regions of the earth . Spruces are large trees , from 20 â tall when mature , and can be distinguished by their whorled branches and conical form . The needles , or leaves , of spruce trees are attached singly to the branches in a spiral fashion , each needle on a small peg-like structure called a pulvinus . The needles are shed when 4 â `` 10 years old , leaving the branches rough with the retained pulvinus ( an easy means of distinguishing them from other similar genera , where the branches are fairly smooth ) . Spruces are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species ; see list of Lepidoptera that feed on spruces . They are also used by the larvae of Gall Adelgids ( Adelges species ) . Scientists have found Norway Spruce in the mountains in western Sweden , nicknamed Old Tjikko , which at an age of 9,550 years are claimed to be the world 's oldest known living trees . DNA analyses have shown that traditional classifications based on the morphology of needle and cone are artificial . A recent study found that P. breweriana had a basal position , followed by P. sitchensis , and the other species were further divided into three clades , suggesting that Picea originated in North America . There are thirty-five named species of spruce in the world . ) ) SCIENCES Spruce Spruce is one of the most important woods for paper uses , as it has long wood fibers which bind together to make strong paper . Spruces are cultivated over vast areas for this purpose . Also , spruce is useful as a building wood , commonly referred to by several different names including North American timber , SPF ( spruce , pine , fir ) and whitewood . Spruce wood is used for many purposes , ranging from general construction work and crates to highly specialised uses in wooden aircraft and many musical instruments called `` Tonewood '' , including guitars , mandolins , cellos , violins , and the soundboard at the heart of a piano . The Wright Brothers ' first aircraft was built of spruce . Because this species has no insect or decay resistance qualities after logging , it is generally recommended for construction purposes as indoor use only ( ex . indoor drywall framing ) . Spruce wood , when left outside can not be expected to last more than 12 â `` 18 months depending on the type of climate it is exposed to . The leaves and branches , or the essential oils , can be used to brew spruce beer . The tips from the needles can be used to make spruce tip syrup . Native Americans in New England also used the sap to make a gum which was used for various reasons , and which was the basis of the first commercial production of chewing gum . In survival situations spruce needles can be directly ingested or boiled into a tea . This replaces large amounts of vitamin C. Also , water is stored in a spruce 's needles , providing an alternative means of hydration . Spruce can be used as a preventative measure for scurvy in an environment where meat is the only prominent food source . The resin was used in the manufacture of pitch in the past ( before the use of petrochemicals ) ; the scientific name Picea is generally thought to be derived from Latin pix , pitch ( though other etymologies have been suggested ) . Native Americans in North America use the thin , pliable roots of some species for weaving baskets and for sewing together pieces of birch bark for canoes . See also Kiidk ` yaas for an unusual golden Sitka Spruce sacred to the Haida people . Spruces are also popular ornamental trees in horticulture , admired for their evergreen , symmetrical narrow-conic growth habit . For the same reason , some ( particularly Picea abies and P. omorika ) are also extensively used as Christmas trees . Spruce branches are also used at Aintree racecourse , Liverpool , to build several of the fences on the Grand National course . It is also used to make sculptures and Christmas trees . The word `` spruce '' entered the English language from Old French `` Pruce '' , the name of Prussia . Spruce was a generic term for commodities brought to England by Hanseatic merchants and the tree was believed to have come from Prussia . According to a different theory , some suggest that it may however be a direct loanword from a Polish expression '' ( drzewo \/ drewno ) z Prus '' which literally means '' ( tree \/ timber ) from Prussia '' . That would suggest that the late mediaeval Polish-speaking merchants would import the timber to England and the English would pick up the expression from them .
Blackmail is the act of threatening to reveal substantially true information about a person to the public , a family member , or associates unless a demand is met . This information is usually of an embarrassing , socially damaging , and\/or incriminating nature . As the information is substantially true , the act of revealing the information may not be criminal in its own right nor amount to a civil law defamation ; it is the making of demands in exchange for withholding the information that is often considered a crime . English Law creates a much broader definition of blackmail , covering any unwarranted demands with menaces , whether involving revealing information or not . However , from a libertarian perspective , blackmail is not always considered a crime . Some libertarians point out that it is licit to gossip about someone else 's secret , to threaten to publicly reveal such information , and to ask that person for money , but it is illegal to combine the threat with the request for money , which raises the question , `` Why do two rights make a wrong ? '' Blackmail is a form of extortion , in which a threat is made to disclose a crime or social disgrace . Extortion is the taking of personal property by threat of future harm . The word is variously derived from the word for tribute ( in modern terms , protection racket ) paid by English and Scottish border dwellers to Border Reivers in return for immunity from raids and other harassment . This tribute was paid in goods or labor ( reditus nigri , or `` blackmail '' ) ; the opposite is blanche firmes or reditus albi , or `` white rent '' ( denoting payment by silver ) . Alternatively , Mckay derives it from two Scottish Gaelic words blathaich pronounced ( the th silent ) bl-aich ( to protect ) and mal ( tribute , payment ) . He notes that the practice was common in the Highlands of Scotland as well as the Borders . : ( a ) that he has reasonable grounds for making the demand ; and : ( b ) that the use of the menaces is a proper means of reinforcing the demand . The Act uses the word `` menaces '' , which is considered wider in scope than `` threat '' and involves a warning of any consequences known to be considered unpleasant by the intended victim . This covers the spectrum from actual or threatened violence to the victim or others , through damage to property , to the disclosure of information . Pretexts for blackmail have included the threat to reveal adultery or criminal acts . But whatever the nature of the menace , it must be direct . Any vague threat to cause `` something bad '' to happen to some other person , except when certain demands are met , are not applicable under the law . Taking hostile action directly does not constitute blackmail , regardless of the legality of the action . For instance , telling a man 's wife that he has committed adultery is legal , even if the man would rather pay money than have his wife learn of his adultery . Blackmail consists of making demands in exchange for not taking the action , when the demand does not meet the criteria specified above . Debt collectors have been accused of blackmail , but those pursuing legal debts are generally able to justify their threats of repossession because , even though it may be unpleasant to the victim , this is a legitimate use of civil law remedies . However , there are limits : many jurisdictions do not allow a `` claim of right '' defense to blackmail . In other words , one can not use blackmail to collect even a valid debt . By contrast , those chasing illegal ( and thus unenforceable ) debts who back up their demands with the threat of bodily injury can not avail themselves of the same defense . There will also be liability even though the debts are legally owed if the menaces are of a criminal nature , for instance of an assault or more serious violence or criminal damage . The maximum sentence under the terms of the Act is 14 years imprisonment ; this reflects the severity of the offence , which can destroy a person 's reputation , personal life and livelihood . If the elements of blackmail are not made out and the defendant has acquired a vehicle , a charge under s12 Act 1968 may be preferred ; see TWOC . states , `` Whoever , under a threat of informing , or as a consideration for not informing , against any violation of any law of the United States , demands or receives any money or other valuable thing , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year , or both .

`` Vermilion '' is a song by American metal band Slipknot . The song is released as the second single from their third album , Vol . 3 : ( The Subliminal Verses ) . When the band plays the song live , they switch from their ordinary masks and wear their alternative `` death masks '' , which is an actual cast of each member 's face . However , during the All Hope Is Gone tour , most members , with the exception of bassist Paul Gray , Craig Jones , and Sid Wilson did not wear the death masks for the song . The song includes a follow-up entitled `` Vermilion Pt . 2 '' which is a continuation of the first part . `` Vermilion , Pt . 2 '' is the continuation of the story told in Part 1 . It features two acoustic guitars , a cello , and singer Corey Taylor 's baritone-stylized vocals . The melody and the overriding theme run through both versions , making them integral pieces to each other . It has been performed live on the Slipknot DVD , Voliminal : Inside the Nine , and was also performed by Corey Taylor and Jim Root on radio station KISS-FM . The album cover for Vermilion Pt . 2 consists of the Vermilion single cover , with a red\/yellow tint , as opposed to the pink and gray tint of Pt . 1 . At the end of the song you hear a piano play the first three notes of Pt . 1 . A remix , entitled `` Vermilion , Pt . 2 ( Bloodstone Mix ) '' , appears on the Underworld : Evolution soundtrack and the special edition of All Hope Is Gone . `` The differences ( between the two tracks ) are subtle â '' ` Vermilion , Pt . 1 ' is about the enrapturing , the buildup , the anticipation and the neurosis , '' says Taylor . '' ` Part 2 ' is the aftermath , the pieces that have to be picked up later , and maybe the guilt of having lived through it . '' . Both songs are said to be about lost or unrequited love from a possibly suicidal person 's perspective and could also be seen as a modern day take on the Dickens character of Estella Havisham . Both songs have respective music videos . The video for `` Pt . 1 '' was directed by Tony Petrossian and percussionist Shawn Crahan and the video for `` Pt . 2 '' was directed by Mark Klasfeld . Both videos were shot in Los Angeles in late-August 2004 . The woman in the videos is actress Janna Bossier . There is speculation over whether or not she was directly related to the band . The video is available on the CD single and the DVD ; Voliminal : Inside the Nine , which was released in 2006 .

The Alderney concentration camps were built and operated by Nazi Germany during its World War II occupation of the Channel Islands . The Channel Islands were the only British Commonwealth soil to be occupied by the Nazis . The Nazis built four concentration camps on Alderney Island , subcamps of the Neuengamme camp outside Hamburg . They were named after the Frisian Islands ( this was probably the Germans trying to show what would happen to Britain , as it were ) : Lager Norderney , Lager Borkum , Lager Sylt and Lager Helgoland . The Nazi Organisation Todt operated each subcamp and used forced labor to build bunkers , gun emplacements , air-raid shelters , and concrete fortifications . The camps commenced operating in January 1942 and had a total inmate population of about 6,000 . The Borkum and Helgoland camps were `` volunteer '' ( Hilfswillige ) labor camps and the labourers in those camps were treated harshly but marginally better than the inmates at the Sylt and Norderney camps . The prisoners in Lager Sylt and Lager Norderney were slave labourers forced to build the many military fortifications and installations throughout Alderney . Sylt camp held Jewish enforced labourers . Norderney camp housed European ( usually Eastern but including Spaniard ) and Russian enforced labourers . Lager Borkum was used for German technicians and `` volunteers '' from different countries of Europe . Lager Helgoland was filled with Russian Organisation Todt workers . In 1942 , Lager Norderney , containing Russian and Polish POWs , and Lager Sylt , holding Jews , were placed under the control of the SS HauptsturmfÃ 1\/4 hrer Max List . Over 700 of the inmates lost their lives before the camps were closed and the remaining inmates transferred to Germany in 1944 . After World War II , a court-martial case was prepared against ex-SS HauptsturmfÃ 1\/4 hrer List , citing atrocities on Alderney . . However , he did not stand trial , and is believed to have lived near Hamburg until his death in the 1980s .
`` Here Comes the Sun '' is a song by George Harrison from The Beatles ' 1969 album Abbey Road . The song , one of Harrison 's best-known Beatles ' contributions alongside `` Something '' , originated from a song-writing collaboration between Harrison and close friend Eric Clapton called `` Badge '' ( recorded by Clapton 's group Cream ) , which featured an arpeggiated guitar riff that is similar to the one that forms the bridge of `` Here Comes the Sun '' . The year 1969 was a difficult one for Harrison : he was arrested for marijuana possession , he had his tonsils removed , and he had quit the band temporarily . The song was written while Harrison was away from all of these troubles . There is a lost photo from the Anthology 3 of George Harrison working on the song , with the capo on the seventh fret . Harrison , McCartney and Starr recorded the rhythm track in 13 takes on 7 July 1969 . John Lennon did not contribute to the song as he was recovering from a car crash . Towards the end of the session Harrison spent an hour re-recording his acoustic guitar part . Harrison capoed his guitar on the 7th fret , resulting the final key of A major . He also used the same technique on his 1965 song `` If I Needed Someone , '' which shares a similar melodic pattern . The following day he taped his lead vocals , and he and McCartney recorded their backing vocals twice to give a fuller sound . A harmonium and handclaps were added on the 16th of July . Harrison added an electric guitar run through a Leslie speaker on 6 August , and the orchestral parts were added on 15 August . `` Here Comes the Sun '' was completed four days later with the addition of Harrison 's Moog synthesizer part . Astronomer and science popularizer Carl Sagan had wanted the song to be included on the Voyager Golden Record , copies of which were attached to both spacecraft of the Voyager program to provide any entity that recovered them a representative sample of human civilization . Although The Beatles favored the idea , EMI refused to release the rights and when the probes were launched in 1977 the song was not included .

Paul Breitner ( born 5 September 1951 in Kolbermoor , Bavaria ) is a former German football player . One of Germany 's most controversial players , he was capped 48 times for his country . His football career lasted from 1970 until 1983 , mainly playing for Bayern Munich ( 1970 â `` 74 and 1978 â `` 83 ) and Real Madrid ( 1974 â `` 78 ) , with one season playing for Eintracht Braunschweig . His early success was as a free roaming left back , as likely to score from the right midfield as to stop an attacker in his own penalty area . Later in his career he moved to midfield and became one of the top midfielders through the early 1980s . The early peak of Breitner 's long and successful career was at age 21 in 1972 as part of the winning German European Championship team . This was followed two years later with victory as a member of the German World Cup squad . The final was played in Munich against the Netherlands , and Breitner scored the first German goal on a penalty kick . In the final , he , Franz Beckenbauer and Berti Vogts formed a slick unit at the back and their water-tight defense prevented the Dutch from winning the World Cup . He moved to Real Madrid following the World Cup and quit the West German squad , remaining off the side until enticed to return by Jupp Derwall in 1981 . Breitner is one of only four footballers to have achieved the feat of scoring in two different World Cup final matches , sharing that honor with PelÃ , VavÃ , and ZinÃ dine Zidane . He achieved this in 1974 against the Netherlands and in 1982 against Italy . During his club career , Breitner won seven National Championships with Bayern Munich ( 1972 , 1973 , 1974 , 1980 , 1981 ) and Real Madrid ( 1975 , 1976 ) , the Champions ' Cup ( 1974 ) as well as the German ( 1971 , 1982 ) and Spanish Cups ( 1975 ) . During his spell with Bayern Munich , Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and he formed such a formidable one-two-punch that they were often called Breitnigge . By many of the older and more traditional football fans in Germany he was decried for his `` revolutionary '' attitude and his tendency for voicing strong opinions on political and social issues . Before the 1982 World Cup ( held in Spain ) former `` leftist '' Breitner caused a major uproar in Germany when he accepted an offer by a German cosmetics company to pay him the â `` what many Germans regarded at that time as a `` scandalously high '' â `` sum of 150,000 Deutsche Mark if he shaved off his fluffy full beard , used their fragrance and advertised for the company . He currently works as a football commentator in Germany and is also an advisor to the Board of Bayern Munich . In 1998 , Breitner was announced as the new national coach by German Football Association president Egidius Braun . However , after some steam from fellow DFB officials , he reconsidered his decision 17 hours later , making Breitner an infamous 17 hours national coach . Today , Breitner works as a TV critic and columnist . In March 2007 he entered into a contract with FC Bayern Munich and acts as an advisor on various issues .

Valon Behrami ( born 19 April 1985 ) is a Swiss footballer of Albanian descent who plays for Fiorentina in the Italian Serie A , as well as the Swiss national team . Behrami was born in Mitrovice , Kosovo , former Yugoslavia to Albanian parents . When Behrami was five , his parents both lost their jobs ; his mother Halime as a secretary and his father Ragip as a manager of a plastics company . As a result , Behrami along with his parents and older sister Valentina moved to Stabio , a village in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland . Behrami 's mother described him as energetic : `` As a child , running was Valon 's favorite pastime â '' he just never got tired . Even now , he can hardly sit still for a second . He always needs a ball at his feet . '' Behrami started out playing football with Swiss club sides FC Stabio , FC Chiasso and FC Lugano . After a number of impressive appearances with Lugano , he was jointly signed by Italian teams Genoa and Udinese in the 2003 â `` 04 season , and played for Genoa in the Serie B championship . In the 2004 â `` 05 season , Genoa bought out Udinese ' rights to the player and loaned him out to Verona , again in Serie B. After an impressive season with Verona , Lazio signed him in the summer of 2005 . Despite his clearance hitting Rodrigo Taddei 's head and ricocheting into Lazio 's goal to concede their first goal of the match , his 92nd minute winning goal etched Behrami 's name into Lazio 's history books as they won the Derby della Capitale on 19 March 2008 and virtually finished the Scudetto hopes for rivals Roma . On 23 July 2008 , West Ham United signed Behrami from Lazio , with the player signing a five-year contract for a fee of Â # 5 million . Behrami made his debut for West Ham in the 2 â `` 1 home win over Wigan Athletic on 16 August 2008 . His versatility would see him become a vital part of West Ham 's midfield , having begun the season as a stand in for captain Lucas Neill at right back . He scored his first goal for West Ham in the 1 â `` 0 away win against Sunderland on 23 November 2008 . During the home win over Manchester City on 1 March 2009 , he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in his left knee that required oxygen to be administered on the field during a six minute break in play . His knee and ankle twisted badly when his studs caught in the turf resulting in a premature end to his 2008 â `` 09 season . Behrami made his comeback as a substitute on 12 September 2009 against Wigan Athletic . His return was interrupted by injury again for a month from November . He scored his first and only goal of the 2009 â `` 10 league campaign with the opener in a 3 â `` 0 home win over relegation rivals Hull City on 20 February 2010 . On 26 January 2011 Behrami moved to Fiorentina for an undisclosed fee , signing a three and a half-year contract . Behrami has also been capped for the Swiss national team at the Under-18 , Under-19 and `` A '' levels . For the Swiss national team , Behrami scored a key goal against Turkey in the Stade de Suisse in the first leg of their World Cup 2006 qualifier playoff tie . During the 2006 World Cup , he endured a groin injury which put him on the sidelines for the first two group matches . In the third match against South Korea , he was substituted late in the game in the 88th minute . He did not participate in the loss to Ukraine in the last 16 knockout round of matches . Behrami was in the starting eleven of Switzerland for all three matches during the 2008 UEFA European Football Championship playing a total of 272 minutes . On 21 June , in the 2010 World Cup , after appearing to elbow Chilean player Arturo Vidal , Behrami was sent off with a red card in the second Group H match against Chile and became the first Swiss player to be sent off in a World Cup match .

This article deals with a province in Belgium . For other uses of Limburg , see : Limburg . For the town of Limbourg or Limburg in Belgium , see : Limbourg Limburg ( Dutch : ) is the easternmost province of Flanders ( which is one of the three regions of Belgium ) , and is located west of the Maas river . It borders on ( clockwise from the North ) the Dutch provinces of North Brabant and Limburg and the Belgian provinces of LiÃ ge , Flemish Brabant and Antwerp . Its capital is Hasselt . It has an area of 2,414 kmÂ which is divided into three Arrondissements ( arrondissementen in Dutch ) containing 44 municipalities . Among them is Genk , one of the economical centres of the province . An educational center , as a result of the presence of a university , is Diepenbeek near Hasselt . The following list contains all governors of the province of Limburg since 1815 . As in all Flemish provinces , the official language is Dutch , but two municipalities : Herstappe and Voeren are to a certain extent allowed to use French to communicate with their citizens ; these are called the municipalities with language facilities . Belgian Limburg is crossed by the Albert Canal , and has historically been a major coal-mining area . North of the Albert Canal and the river Demer , is the Campine region , with sandy soils , bush , forests and the coal-mining area . South of the Albert Canal and the river Demer , is the Hesbaye region , with fertile soils , farming and fruit . In the southeast also more low hills . Limburg 's name derives from the fortified castle town known as Limbourg , situated on the river Vesdre in the Ardennes , now in the Walloon province of LiÃ ge . It was the seat of the medieval Duchy of Limburg which extended into the Meuse region north of the city of LiÃ ge . However , most the area of the current Dutch Limburg was not part of this polity but was divided among several states including the Duchy of Brabant , the Duchy of JÃ 1\/4 lich , and the Bishopric of LiÃ ge , as well as the Duchy of Limburg . A result of this division is still evident in the plethora of distinct varieties of the Limburgish language spoken in Limburg municipalities . Following the Napoleonic Era , the great powers ( United Kingdom , Prussia , Austrian Empire , Russian Empire , and France ) united the region with the new United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815 . A new province was formed and was to receive the name `` Maastricht '' , after its capital . The first king , William I , who did not want the name Limbourg to be lost , insisted that the name be changed to `` Limburg '' . As such , the name of the new province derived from the old Duchy of Limburg that had existed until 1648 within the triangle of Maastricht , LiÃ ge , and Aachen . When the Catholic South , both the Dutch and French speaking regions , split away from the mainly Calvinist , Dutch North in the Belgian Revolution of 1830 , the province of Limburg was at first almost entirely under Belgian rule . In 1839 Limburg was split into so-called Dutch Limburg and Belgian Limburg , though it became Flemish when all provinces in Belgium came under control of institutional regions . Limburg mijn Vaderland is the official anthem of both Belgian and Dutch Limburg . 2 . As 3 . Beringen 8 . Diepenbeek 10 . Genk 11 . Gingelom 12 . Halen 13 . Ham 15 . Hasselt 18 . Herk-de-Stad 20 .

Oxygen difluoride is the chemical compound with the formula OF2 . As predicted by VSEPR theory , the molecule adopts a `` V '' shaped structure like H2O , but it has very different properties , being a strong oxidizer . Oxygen difluoride was first reported in 1929 ; it was obtained by the electrolysis of molten potassium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid containing small quantities of water . The modern preparation entails the reaction of fluorine with a dilute aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide , with sodium fluoride as a side-product : Its powerful oxidizing properties are suggested by the oxidation number of +2 for the oxygen atom , which is unusual . Above 200 Â C , OF2 decomposes to oxygen and fluorine via a radical mechanism . OF2 reacts with many metals to yield oxides and fluorides . Nonmetals also react : phosphorus reacts with OF2 to form PF5 and POF3 ; sulfur gives SO2 and SF4 ; and unusually for a noble gas , xenon reacts , yielding XeF4 and xenon oxyfluorides . In Robert L. Forward 's science fiction novel Camelot 30K , oxygen difluoride was used as a biochemical solvent by fictional life forms living in the solar system 's Kuiper belt . OF2 is a dangerous chemical , as is the case for any strongly oxidizing gas .

TaquerÃ a ( sometimes misspelled as taquiria ) is a Spanish word meaning taco shop . In some localities , however , it is used to refer to restaurants specializing in burritos , although tacos and other dishes are often served as well . TaquerÃ as had their beginnings as street vendors . However , many taquerÃ as today have moved into buildings and become restaurants . Taquerias are the traditional Mexican fast-food restaurants , specializing in soft tacos with either flour or corn tacos . Taqueria tacos are generally filled with stew-like meats and topped with chopped white onions and cilantro Occasionally , you 'll see cabbage , lettuce , or tomatoes , but never lettuce and cabbage at the same time . Hot sauce -- green or red ; mild , moderate , or spicy -- add the finishing touch . Here are some examples of taqueria taco fillings for lunch or dinner : ( 1 ) barbacoa = steamed cheek from a cow , ( 2 ) carnitas = shredded mild pork , ( 3 ) pollo = shredded chicken ( familiar in Tex-Mex restaurants also ) , ( 4 ) pastor = spicy pork roast with guajillo , pequin , ancho and arbol peppers -- together with pineapple and garlic , ( 5 ) tripas = beef intestines that can be cooked soft or crunchy . Refried beans goes with crunchy ( bien dorrada ) tripas , ( 6 ) fajitas = skirt steak ( another common Tex-Mex item ) , ( 7 ) ground beef ( the ubiquitous hard taco filling ) , and ( 8 ) chorizo = spicy ground sausage .
The Rape of the Lock is a mock-heroic narrative poem written by Alexander Pope , first published anonymously in Lintot 's Miscellany in May 1712 in two cantos ( 334 lines ) , but then revised , expanded and reissued under Pope 's name on March 2 , 1714 , in a much-expanded 5-canto version ( 794 lines ) . The final form was available in 1717 with the addition of Clarissa 's speech on good humor . The poem satirises a petty squabble by comparing it to the epic world of the gods . It was based on an incident recounted by Pope 's friend , John Caryll . Arabella Fermor and her suitor , Lord Petre , were both from aristocratic recusant Catholic families at a period in England when under such laws as the Test Act , all denominations except Anglicanism suffered legal restrictions and penalties ( for example Petre could not take up his place in the House of Lords as a Catholic ) . Petre , lusting after Arabella , had cut off a lock of her hair without permission , and the consequent argument had created a breach between the two families . Pope , also a Catholic , wrote the poem at the request of friends in an attempt to `` comically merge the two . '' He utilised the character Belinda to represent Arabella and introduced an entire system of `` sylphs , '' or guardian spirits of virgins , a parodic version of the gods and goddesses of conventional epic . Popeâ s poem mocks the traditions of classical epics : the abduction of Helen of Troy becomes here the theft of a lock of hair ; the gods become minute sylphs ; the description of Achillesâ shield becomes an excursus on one of Belindaâ s petticoats . He also uses the epic style of invocations , lamentations , exclamations and similes , and in some cases adds parody to imitation by following the framework of actual speeches in Homerâ s Iliad . Although the poem is humorous at times , Pope keeps a sense that beauty is fragile , and that the loss of a lock of hair touches Belinda deeply . As his introductory letter makes clear , women in that period were essentially supposed to be decorative rather than rational , and the loss of beauty was a serious matter . The humor of the poem comes from the storm in a teacup of vanity being couched within the elaborate , formal verbal structure of an epic poem . Three of Uranus 's moons are named after characters from The Rape of the Lock : Belinda , Umbriel , and Ariel , the last name also ( previously ) appearing in Shakespeare 's The Tempest . It is one of the most commonly cited examples of high burlesque .
The tropics is a region of the Earth by the Equator . It is limited in latitude by the Tropic of Cancer in the northern hemisphere at approximately N and the Tropic of Capricorn in the southern hemisphere at S. The tropics are also referred to as the tropical zone and the torrid zone ( see geographical zone ) . The tropics include all the areas on the Earth where the Sun reaches a point directly overhead at least once during the solar year . `` Tropical '' is sometimes used in a general sense for a tropical climate to mean warm to hot and moist year-round , often with the sense of lush vegetation . Many tropical areas have a dry and wet season . The wet season , or rainy season , is the time of year , covering one or more months , when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls . The term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities . Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics . Under the Koppen climate classification , for tropical climates , a wet season month is defined as a month where average precipitation is 60 m or more . Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons , since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year . Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location during the middle of the warm season . When the wet season occurs during the warm season , or summer , precipitation falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours . The wet season is a time when air quality improves , freshwater quality improves , and vegetation grows significantly , leading to crop yields late in the season . Floods cause rivers to overflow their banks , and some animals to retreat to higher ground . Soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases . The incidence of malaria increases in areas where the rainy season coincides with high temperatures . Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime . Unfortunately , the previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season , as the crops have yet to mature . Regions within the tropics may well not have a tropical climate . There are alpine tundra and snow-capped peaks , including Mauna Kea , Mount Kilimanjaro , and the Andes as far south as the northernmost parts of Chile and Argentina . Under the KÃ ppen climate classification , much of the area within the geographical tropics is classed not as `` tropical '' but as `` dry '' ( arid or semi-arid ) including the Sahara Desert , the Atacama Desert and Australian Outback . Tropical plants and animals are those species native to the tropics . Tropical ecosystems may consist of rainforests , dry deciduous forests , spiny forests , desert and other habitat types . There are often significant areas of biodiversity , and species endemism present , particularly in rainforests and dry deciduous forests . Some examples of important biodiversity and\/or high endemism ecosystems are : El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico , Costa Rican and Nicaraguan rainforests , Brazilian and Venezuelan Amazon Rainforest territories , Madagascar dry deciduous forests , Waterberg Biosphere of South Africa and eastern Madagascar rainforests . Often the soils of tropical forests are low in nutrient content making them quite vulnerable to slash-and-burn techniques , which are sometimes an element of shifting cultivation agricultural systems . In biogeography , the tropics are divided into paleotropics ( Africa , Asia and Australia ) and neotropics ( Central and South America ) . Together , they are sometimes referred to as the pantropics . The neotropic region should not be confused with the ecozone of the same name ; in the Old World , this is unambiguous as the paleotropics correspond to the Afrotropical , Indomalayan , and partly the Australasian and Oceanic ecozones . About 40 percent of the world 's human population lives within the tropical zone ( by 2008 statistics ) , and by 2060 , 60 % of the human population will be in the tropics , owing to high birth rates and migration .
KÅ chi Prefecture is a prefecture of Japan located on the south coast of Shikoku . The capital is the city of KÅ chi . Prior to the Meiji Restoration , KÅ chi was known as Tosa Province . KÅ chi Prefecture comprises the southwestern part of the island of Shikoku , facing the Pacific Ocean . It is the largest but least populous of Shikoku 's four prefectures . Most of the province is mountainous , and in only a few areas such as around KÅ chi and Nakamura is there a coastal plain . KÅ chi is famous for its many rivers . Inamura-yama in Tosa-cho is the highest peak in Kochi prefecture with an altitude of 1506 meters above sea level . These are the towns and villages in each district . The sports teams listed below are based in KÅ chi .
BÃ rurier noir is a French punk band formed in Paris in 1983 by Loran ( guitar ) , FranÃ ois ( vocals ) and DÃ dÃ ( drum machine ) . They called themselves `` noir '' ( black ) for the color of mourning ( because their first concert was planned to be also their last ) and for anarchy and `` BÃ rurier '' after the character from the novels of FrÃ dÃ ric Dard . Instead of being an end , the success of their first show inspired them to continue . A cult band , BÃ rurier Noir were loved by a generation of youth and feared by concert organisers for the riots that followed their shows . On the one hand , BÃ rurier Noir 's music was clearly derived from British punk rock as far as music and lyrics were concerned . Most of their songs were short , aggressive and usually based on a couple of basic power chords . Their lyrics reflected the typical concerns of punks such as the rejection of consumerism , politics and traditional social order and the anger felt by disaffected youth , tramps and outsiders in general . On the other , they added some interesting innovations . Their rhythm section consisted of a cheap ( but still more reliable than a drummer ) drum machine , which became an essential and arguably endearing part of their sound . The frequent use of a saxophone as of the mid-eighties also set them apart from most other punk rock bands . They would regularly appear on record sleeves and on stage wearing clown outfits , mock police uniforms or pig masks . Their shows were a unique and highly festive cross between a punk rock concert , a grotesque circus and an anarchist rally . By 1985 , the band had grown to include FranÃ ois Guillemot ( vocals ) , Loran ( guitar ) , Pascal kung fu ( saxophone ) , Helno ( backing vocals ) , Laul aka Bol ( backing vocals ) , la grande Titi ( backing vocals ) , la petite Titi ( backing vocals ) . By 1987 : FranÃ ois Guillemot ( vocals ) , Loran ( guitar ) , Masto ( saxophone ) , Helno ( backing vocals ) , Laul aka Bol ( backing vocals ) , la grande Titi ( backing vocals ) , la petite Titi ( backing vocals ) . By 1989 : FranÃ ois Guillemot ( vocals ) , Loran ( guitar ) , Masto ( saxophone ) , la petite Titi ( backing vocals ) , Jojo ( fire breather and backing vocals ) . The band refused to make a profit and also to work . As a result , they lived precariously . In 1989 , after three farewell concerts at the Paris Olympia , they disbanded . FranÃ ois later formed MolodoÃ and `` FranÃ ois BÃ ru et les Anges DÃ chus '' , Loran formed Ze6 , Tromatism and later A.D. ( Division de la horde ) . On December 4 , 2003 , they reunited for the release of a DVD documenting their career . The concert took place in the context of the Transmusicales in Rennes . They have since played other concerts , in Quebec City ( in front of more than 50,000 people ) and in Belgium .
Victor Amadeus of Savoy ( Vittorio Amedeo Giovanni Filippo ; 6 May , 1699 -- 22 March , 1715 ) was the eldest son of Victor Amadeus II , Duke of Savoy and his French wife Anne Marie d'Orl Ã ans . He was the Heir apparent of Savoy from his birth and as such was styled as the Prince of Piedmont . He acted as Regent of Savoy from September 1713 till September 1714 in the absences of his father . He died of smallpox at the age of 15 . The Prince of Piedmont was born in Turin on 6 May 1699 . He was the fifth child and first son of his parents and was baptised with the names Vittorio Amadeo Giovanni Filippo . The eldest son he would remain close to his father all his life who in turn adored his son who was named after him . Though his parents were not close he also had a close relationship with his mother Anne Marie d'Orl Ã ans , a niece of Louis XIV and grand daughter of the murdered Charles I of England . From birth he was styled as the Prince of Piedmont , the typical style for the Heir apparent to the Duke of Savoy . Piedmont was born at a time when the House of Savoy was in need of a male heir to succeed as the duchy observed the salic law which forbade females to inherit the throne . His birth was greeted with great celebration and throughout his life , his health would require constant attention . He was the brother of the Princess Maria Adelaide wife of the Duke of Burgundy and daughter-in-law of Le Grand Dauphin . His other sister was Queen Maria Luisa of Spain wife of Philip V. In 1701 his brother Charles Emmanuel , Duke of Aosta was born and it was he who would later succeed to rule Savoy . During the Battle of Turin he , his mother , grandmother and younger brother had to flee Turin for their safety and go to Genoa . His father took part in the battle which was played out to west of the city . The prince was moved from female care in 1708 . In 1713 , at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession , by the Treaty of Utrecht , Sicily was ceded to the Duke of Savoy , Piedmont 's father . As such , Piedmont became the heir to a Kingdom rather than a sovereign Duchy . In September his parents set off for Palermo in Sicily in order to be crowned officially . Victor Amadeus II asked his mother Marie Jeanne of Savoy to maintain a regency in his absence but she declined and the Piedmont was give the post . Piedmont 's regency ended when his father returned in September 1714 . Strained relations between Savoy and Austria caused plans for the Prince of Piedmont to wed Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria , a daughter of the late Joseph I , Holy Roman Emperor but plans were ignored by his father . There were also negotiations for Piedmont to wed Elisabeth Farnese . Piedmont died in Turin on 22 March 1715 having caught smallpox . He was buried at the Cathedral of Saint Giovanni Battista and later moved to the Basilica of Superga outside Turin . His body is located in the Sala degli Infanti ( Hall of the Infantes ( children ) ) . He was succeeded as Prince of Piedmont by his younger brother Charles Emmanuel , Duke of Aosta .

Principia Discordia is a Discordian religious text written by Greg Hill ( Malaclypse The Younger ) and Kerry Thornley ( Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst ) . It was originally published under the title `` Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost '' in a limited edition of 5 copies in 1965 . The name , meaning `` The Principles of Strife '' , deviates from correct Latin which would read Principia DiscordiÃ . The Principia describes the Discordian Society and its Goddess Eris , as well as the basics of the POEE denomination of Discordianism . It features typewritten and handwritten text intermixed with clip art , stamps , and seals appropriated from other sources , possibly in violation of copyright laws . While the Principia is full of literal contradictions and unusual humor , it contains several passages which propose that there is serious intent behind the work , for example a message scrawled on page 00075 : `` If you think the PRINCIPIA is just a ha-ha , then go read it again . '' The Principia is quoted extensively in and shares many themes with the science fiction book The Illuminatus ! Trilogy by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson . While Wilson was not directly involved in writing the Principia , both the letter signed `` Mad Malik '' and the stamps used were his . Notable symbols in the book include the Apple of Discord , the pentagon , and the `` Sacred Chao '' , which resembles the Taijitu of Taoism , but the two principles depicted are `` Hodge '' and `` Podge '' rather than yin and yang , and they are represented by the apple and the pentagon , and not by dots . Saints identified include Emperor Norton , Yossarian , Don Quixote , and Bokonon . The Principia also introduces the mysterious word fnord , later popularized in The Illuminatus ! Trilogy ; the trilogy itself is mentioned in the afterword to the Loompanics edition , and in the various introductions to the fifth editions . The full title of the fourth and most well-known edition is Principia Discordia or How I Found Goddess And What I Did To Her When I Found Her : The Magnum Opiate Of Malaclypse The Younger , Wherein is Explained Absolutely Everything Worth Knowing About Absolutely Anything . This being the 4th Edition , March 1970 , San Francisco ; a revision of the 3rd Edition of 500 copies , whomped together in Tampa 1969 ; which revised the 2nd Edition of 100 copies from Los Angeles 1969 ; which was a revision of PRINCIPIA DISCORDIA or HOW THE WEST WAS LOST published in New Orleans in 1965 in five copies , which were mostly lost . Additionally , the `` contents of this edition '' note in the Loompanics edition identifies the fourth edition as having originally been published by Rip Off Press of San Francisco , California . A `` Fifth Edition '' consisting of a single Western Union telegram page filled with the letter M was published as an appendix to the Loompanics and SJ Games re-printings of the 4th Edition . In 1978 , a copy of a work from Kerry Thornley titled `` THE PRINCIPIA DISCORDIA or HOW THE WEST WAS LOST '' was placed in the HSCA JFK collections as document 010857 . A scan of this document has been identified as the first edition and uploaded to 23ae . com . The record identifier can be found by searching for Thornley and Discordian on nara . gov. The Principia includes a notice which purports to disclaim any copyright in relation to the work : '' â `` All Rites Reversed - reprint what you like . '' Regardless of the legal effect of this notice , the Principia has been widely disseminated in the public domain via the Internet and more traditional print publishers . Some re-publishers have claimed copyright in relation to the additional material included in their editions . In Discordian mythology , Aneris is described as the sister of Eris aka Discordia . Whereas Eris\/Discordia is the Goddess of Disorder and Being , Aneris\/Harmonia is the Goddess of Order and Non-Being . In the beginning there was VOID , who had two daughters ; one ( the smaller ) was that of BEING , named ERIS , and one ( the larger ) was of NON-BEING , named ANERIS . The sterile Aneris becomes jealous of Eris ( who was born pregnant ) , and starts making existent things non-existent . This explains why life begins , and later ends in death . And to this day , things appear and disappear in this very manner . The Aneristic Principle is that of APPARENT ORDER ; the Eristic Principle is that of APPARENT DISORDER . Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of PURE CHAOS , which is a level deeper than is the level of distinction making . The following links lead to foreign language translations of the Principia . Note that at present the Polish edition appears to be a work in process .
Te ( Ð cents Ñ ; italics : Ð cents Ñ ) is a letter of the Cyrillic alphabet . It commonly represents the voiceless alveolar plosive \/ t \/ , like the pronunciation of â tâ in `` tick '' . The Cyrillic letter Te was derived from the Greek letter Tau ( Î Ï ) . The name of Te in the Early Cyrillic alphabet was ( tvrdo ) , meaning `` hard '' or `` surely '' . In the Cyrillic numeral system , Te had a value of 300 . The capital Cyrillic letter Te ( Ð cents Ñ ) looks the same as the capital Latin letter T ( T t ) but , as with most Cyrillic letters , the lowercase form is simply a smaller version of the uppercase . In italic type and cursive , the lowercase form â Ñ â looks like the italic form of the lowercase Latin M â mâ , except in Serbian and Macedonian usage where it looks like an inverted lowercase Latin M , with a stroke above to distinguish it from the otherwise identical italic lowercase letter Sha â Ñ â . Compare the 4th letter pair in the 4th row with the last letter pair of the last row of the chart at left . The cursive form of the capital letter Te can also be seen in the chart following the lower case letter . The pronunciations shown in the table are the primary ones for each language ; for details consult the articles on the languages .
Nichrome is a trademark for a non-magnetic alloy of nickel , chromium , and often iron , usually used as a resistance wire , produced by the Driver-Harris Company . A common alloy is 80 % nickel and 20 % chromium , by mass , but there are many others to accommodate various applications . It is silvery-grey in color , is corrosion-resistant , and has a high melting point of about 1400 Â C ( 2552 Â F ) . Due to its relatively high electrical resistivity and resistance to oxidation at high temperatures , it is widely used in electric heating elements , such as in hair dryers , electric ovens , soldering iron , toasters , and even electronic cigarettes . Typically , Nichrome is wound in coils to a certain electrical resistance , and current is passed through to produce heat . Nichrome is used in the explosives and fireworks industry as a bridgewire in electric ignition systems , such as electric matches and model rocket igniters . Nichrome wire is commonly used in ceramics as an internal support structure to help some elements of clay sculptures hold their shape while they are still soft . Nichrome wire is used because of its ability to withstand the high temperatures that occur when clay work is fired in a kiln . Nichrome wire is used in testing the color of the flame in the non-luminous part of fire of a cation such as the cations of potassium , copper , calcium , sodium etc. The alloy tends to be expensive due to its high nickel content . Distributor pricing is typically indexed to commodity market prices for nickel . Other areas of usage include motorcycle silencers , and in certain microbiological lab apparatus . For heating , resistance wire must be stable in air when hot . Nichrome wire forms a protective layer of chromium oxide . The properties of Nichrome vary depending on its alloy . Figures given are representative of typical material and are accurate to expressed significant figures . Any variations are due to different percentages of nickel or chromium .

The flag of the state of Alaska consists of eight gold stars , forming the Big Dipper and the North Star , on a dark blue field . The Big Dipper is an asterism in the constellation Ursa Major which symbolizes a bear , an animal indigenous to Alaska . As depicted on the flag , its stars can be used as a guide by the novice to locate Polaris and determine true north , which varies considerably from a magnetic north . The design was created by Benny Benson of Seward and selected from among roughly 700 entries in a 1927 contest . More than 30 years before Alaska was to become a state , the Alaska Department of the American Legion sponsored a territorial contest for Alaskan children in grades seven through twelve . Winning the contest in 1927 , the design of Benny Benson , a 13-year-old Alaska Native residing at the Jesse Lee Home for Children in Seward , was chosen to represent the future of the Alaska Territory . Up to that time , Alaskans had flown only the U.S. flag since the territory was purchased from Russia in 1867 . Benson 's design was chosen over roughly 700 other submissions from schoolchildren territory-wide in grades 7 -- 12 . Most other entries featured variations on the territorial seal , the midnight sun , the northern lights , polar bears , and\/or gold pans . To celebrate his achievement , Benson was awarded US$ 1,000 and an engraved watch . Benny looked to the sky for the symbols he included in his design . Choosing the familiar constellation he looked for every night before going to sleep at the orphanage , he submitted this description with it : The Russian-American Company ( RAC ) flag was authorized under Czar Alexander I in 1806 . It was the first special flag granted by the Russian government to any private company . The flag was granted on September 19 , 1806 , by the Saint Petersburg offices . The RAC flag was authorized to be raised over Russian fortifications and on RAC ships in place of naval flags . The RAC flag has three stripes : the lower red , the middle blue , and the upper and wider stripe white . Painted on the flag is the Russian imperial crest , the double-headed eagle . A ribbon hanging from the talons of the eagle has the inscription , `` Russian American Company '' . On the breast of the double headed eagle is a square with a red shield and Saint George on a white steed looking to the left . The flag flew over Alaska until October 18 , 1867 , when all Russian-American Company holdings in Alaska were sold to the United States . The Alaska Legislature adopted Benson 's design as the official flag for the Territory of Alaska on May 2 , 1927 . The first flag made based on Benny 's design was made of blue silk and appliquÃ d gold stars , and was inaugurally flown July 9 , 1927 . It was retained as the state flag upon statehood in 1959 . The flag 's symbolism is described in the state song , `` Alaska 's Flag '' .
LeonÃ dio Fantoni , best known as Niginho or Fantoni III ( born in Belo Horizonte , February 12 , 1912 -- died September 5 , 1975 ) was a Brazilian professional Football ( soccer ) forward player . His Italian-origins family was a supporter of Cruzeiro , than known as `` Palestra ItÃ lia '' . Fantoni started his career in that club , playing with his brother JoÃ # o Fantoni ( NinÃ # o ) and their cousin OtÃ vio Fantoni ( Nininho ) . In 1931 , they were sold to Lazio , where they would be known by their surnames , like a dinasty : NinÃ # o was Fantoni I , Nininho was Fantoni II and him , Fantoni III . They played with another Italian-Brazilian player , Anfilogino Guarisi , in a Lazio squad known as `` Brasilazio '' . Before moving to Italy , Niginho conquested the Minas Gerais State Championship in 1928 , 1929 and 1930 . In 1935 , having dual citizenship , he was called by the Italian Army to fight in the invasion of Abissinia . He had married just one month before , and decided to go back to Brazil . Lazio authorized it and paid the ship ticket . That year was particularly difficult to him : his cousin Fantoni II died of generalized infection from a broken nose . Without formal authorization of Lazio , Niginho transferred to Palmeiras , than also known as Palestra ItÃ lia . Playing there from march to may , he scored six goals in six games and conquered the SÃ # o Paulo State Championship . After that , he played in Vasco da Gama in 1937 . In that club , he received his first call to Brazil national football team . He was called to 1938 FIFA World Cup as a LeÃ nidas da Silva stand-by player . Unfortunately , the Italians warned FIFA that Niginho was in irregular situation , needing an authorization of Lazio to play , and that he as a desertor of Italian Army . LeÃ nidas injured himself in the game against Czechoslovakia and had to play again in the play-off against the Czechs , because Niginho could n't substitute him . His injury got worse and he had n't conditions to play against Italy in the semifinals . In 1939 , Niginho came back to Palestra ItÃ lia , who had to change its name to Cruzeiro in 1942 . He conquered another tricampeonato , the Minas Gerais State Championship in 1943 , 1944 and 1945 . He played in there along another brother , Orlando Fantoni . Orlando would also play in Lazio , becaming known as Fantoni IV . Niginho stopped to play in 1946 , but would be linked with Cruzeiro until his death . As a coach , he conquered the tricampeonato in 1959 , 1960 and 1961 . In the 60s , his nephews Benito Fantoni and Fernando Fantoni played in the club . Fernando would also play in Lazio , as Fantoni V. Niginho died by a heart attack in 1975 , when he was visiting Cruzeiro . He was one of the top goalscorers in the clubs history , scoring 207 goals in 272 appearances , and the biggest idol in the pre-Mineir Ã # o years .
In popular music , a side project is a project undertaken by one or more persons already known for their involvement in another band . It can also be an artist or a band temporarily switching to a different style . Usually these projects emphasize a different aspect of that person 's or that band 's musical interests that they feel they can not explore within the boundaries established by their main project . Side projects can later become full-time endeavors , but should not be confused with quitting a band for a solo career or another band . One example of musical side projects is Kiss 's decision in 1978 to have each member of the band , Gene Simmons , Paul Stanley , Ace Frehley and Peter Criss , simultaneously release solo albums . In 1992 , The Melvins released solo EPs in a similar fashion . `` Side project '' may also refer to pursuits of famous individuals outside of their primary fields . For instance , Wicked Wisdom is a `` side project '' of actress Jada Pinkett Smith . Side projects often occur at a crossroads of a celebrity 's career . A side project can also be a band that takes on an `` alter-ego '' , usually in order to play a different style of music that their fans are not used to . An example of this type of side project would be the band Weezer , who is also the Nirvana cover band Goat Punishment .
Liesel ( `` Liese '' ) Prokop-Sykora ( March 27 , 1941 -- December 31 , 2006 ) was an Austrian athlete who competed mainly in the pentathlon and , later in her life , an Austrian politician . Born as Liese Sykora in Vienna , she competed for Austria in the 1968 Summer Olympics held in Mexico City , Mexico in the Pentathlon where she won the silver medal . In 1965 she married her former coach , Gunnar Prokop . The couple had two sons and a daughter . Later she started a political career in Lower Austria . Since December 2004 she had been Austrian Minister of the Interior for the conservative People 's Party ( Ã -- VP ) . She died unexpectedly of aortic dissection while being rushed to a Sankt PÃ lten hospital on New Year 's Eve , 2006 . She was the sister of Maria Sykora , who competed at the 1972 Summer Olympics , and aunt of Winter Olympic bronze medalist Thomas Sykora .

Lipovans or Lippovans are the Old Believers , mostly of Russian ethnic origin , who settled in the Moldavian Principality , in Dobruja and Eastern Muntenia . According to the 2002 Romanian census there are a total of 35,791 Lipovans in Romania , of whom 21,623 living in Dobruja . The name has been suggested to be related to Russian Ð Ð Ð Ð ( lipa ) , linden tree or to Filippovka , a holiday name dedicated to Saint Philip , however , the accepted etymology says it 's derived from name of Filipp Pustosviat ( 1672 â `` 1742 ) , the adepts of whom being named filippovcy or ( fi ) lippovane . They emigrated from Russia over 200 years ago as dissenters with the mainline Russian Orthodox Church . They settled along the Prut River in Moldavia and in the Danube Delta . They have maintained strong religious traditions that predate the reforms of the Russian Orthodox Church undertaken during the reign of Patriarch Nikon . When he made changes to worship in 1652 , part of the believers carried on worshipping in the `` old way '' . In that sense , they continued to speak Old Russian , to cross themselves with two fingers instead of three , and to keep their beards . The Russian government and the Orthodox Church persecuted them and as a result some committed suicide by burning themselves , with many other being forced to emigrate . In 1876 , the Lipovans were joined by some Skoptsy sect members who emigrated to Romania to escape prosecution . The Lipovans were considered to be schismatic by the Nikonians . However others consider this label to be incorrect . The main center of Lipovan community in Ukraine is Vilkovo . The town has its own church , St Nicholas . In order to construct their homes , the Lipovans create islets of dry land by digging mud out from trenches and put into work a series of canals . The house walls are made of reed and mud , and thatching is standard for the roofing . Because of the characteristics of these materials , the buildings have a tendency to sink into the mud and need to be rebuilt every few years . For details on the Lipovans in Bulgaria , see Russians in Bulgaria .
A Petri dish ( or Petri plate or cell culture dish ) is a shallow glass or plastic cylindrical lidded dish that biologists use to culture cells or small moss plants . It was named after German bacteriologist Julius Richard Petri , who invented it when working as an assistant to Robert Koch . Glass Petri dishes can be reused by sterilization ( for example , in an autoclave or by dry heating in a hot air oven at 160 Â C for one hour ) . For experiments where cross-contamination from one experiment to the next can become a problem , plastic Petri dishes are often used as disposables . Modern Petri dishes often have rings on the lids and bases , which allow them to be stacked so that they do not slide off one another . Multiple dishes can also be incorporated into one plastic container to create what is called a `` multi-well plate '' . Petri dishes are often used to make agar plates for microbiology studies . The dish is partially filled with warm liquid containing agar and a mixture of specific ingredients that may include nutrients , blood , salts , carbohydrates , dyes , indicators , amino acids and antibiotics . After the agar cools and solidifies , the dish is ready to receive a microbe-laden sample in a process known as inoculation or `` plating . '' For virus or phage cultures , a two-step inoculation is needed : bacteria are grown first to provide hosts for the viral inoculum . Petri plates are incubated upside down ( agar on top ) to lessen the risk of contamination from settling airborne particles and to prevent water condensation from accumulating and disturbing the cultured microbes . Petri dishes are also used for eukaryotic cell culture in liquid medium or using solid agar . Empty Petri dishes may be used to observe plant germination or small animal behavior , or for other day-to-day laboratory practices such as drying fluids in an oven and carrying and storing samples . Their optical transparency and flat profile lend them to their common use as a temporary receptacle for viewing samples ( especially liquid ones ) under a low power microscope .
Subspecies ( commonly abbreviated subsp . or ssp . ) in biological classification , is either a taxonomic rank subordinate to species , or a taxonomic unit in that rank ( plural : subspecies ) . A subspecies can not be recognized in isolation : a species will either be recognized as having no subspecies at all or two or more , never just one . Organisms that belong to different subspecies of the same species are capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring , but they often do not interbreed in nature due to geographic isolation or other factors . The differences between subspecies are usually less distinct than the differences between species , but more distinct than the differences between breeds or races ( races can be assigned to different subspecies if taxonomically different ) . The characteristics attributed to subspecies generally have evolved as a result of geographical distribution or isolation . In zoology , the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( 4th edition , 1999 ) accepts only one rank below that of species , namely the rank of subspecies . Other groupings , `` infrasubspecific entities '' ( e.g. pet breeds and Transgenic Animals ) do not have names regulated by the ICZN . Such forms have no official status , though they may be useful in describing altitudinal or geographical clines . The scientific name of a subspecies is a binomen followed by a subspecific name , as Panthera tigris sumatrae ( Sumatran Tiger ) . A name of this kind is called a trinomen . Likewise in bacteriology , the only rank allowed below species is subspecies . Names published before 1992 in the rank of variety are taken to be names of subspecies ( see International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria ) . In botany , subspecies is one of many ranks below that of species , such as variety , subvariety , form , and subform . The subspecific name is preceded by `` ssp . '' or `` subsp . '' , as Schoenoplectus californicus ssp . tatora ( Totora ) . Any botanical name including a subspecies , variety , etc. , is called a ternary name . In Zoological nomenclature when a species is split into subspecies , the originally described population is retained as the `` nominate subspecies '' , which repeats the same name as its species , for example , Motacilla alba alba ( often abbreviated Motacilla a. alba ) is the nominate subspecies of the White Wagtail ( Motacilla alba ) . The repetition of the species name is referred to in Botanical nomenclature as the subspecies `` autonym '' , and the subspecies as the `` autonymous subspecies '' . When biologists disagree over whether a certain population is a subspecies or a full species , the species name may be written in parentheses . Thus Larus ( argentatus ) smithsonianus means the American Herring Gull ; the notation with parentheses means that some consider it a subspecies of a larger Herring Gull species and therefore call it Larus argentatus smithsonianus , while others consider it a full species and therefore call it Larus smithsonianus ( and the user of the notation is not taking a position ) . Members of one subspecies differ morphologically or by different coding sequences of DNA from members of other subspecies of the species . Subspecies are defined in relation to species . If the two groups do not interbreed because of something intrinsic to their genetic make-up ( perhaps green frogs do not find red frogs sexually attractive , or they breed at different times of year ) then they are different species . If , on the other hand , the two groups would interbreed freely provided only that some external barrier were removed ( perhaps there is a waterfall too high for frogs to scale , or the populations are far distant from one another ) then they are subspecies . Other factors include differences in mating behavior or time and ecological preferences such as soil content . Note that the distinction between a species and a subspecies depends only on the likelihood that in the absence of external barriers the two populations would merge back into a single , genetically unified population . It has nothing to do with ` how different ' the two groups appear to be to the human observer . As knowledge of a particular group increases , its categorisation may need to be re-assessed . The Rock Pipit was formerly classed as a subspecies of Water Pipit , but is now recognized to be a full species . For an example of a subspecies , see Pied Wagtail . Cryptic species are morphologically similar , but have differences in DNA or other factors . A polytypic species has two or more subspecies , races or more generally speaking , populations that need a separate description . These are separate groups that are clearly distinct from one another and do not generally interbreed ( although there may be a relatively narrow hybridization zone ) , but which would interbreed freely if given the chance to do so . Note that groups which would not interbreed freely , even if brought together such that they had the opportunity to do so , are not subspecies : they are separate species . A monotypic species has no distinct population or races , or rather one race comprising the whole species . Monotypic species can occur in several ways :
A thesaurus is a reference work that lists words grouped together according to similarity of meaning ( containing synonyms and sometimes antonyms ) , in contrast to a dictionary , which contains definitions and pronunciations . The largest thesaurus in the world is the Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary , which contains more than 920,000 words . In antiquity , Philo of Byblos authored the first text that could now be called a thesaurus . In Sanskrit , the Amarakosha is a thesaurus in verse form , written in the 4th century . The first example of the modern genre , Roget 's Thesaurus , was compiled in 1805 by Peter Mark Roget , and published in 1852 . Entries in Roget 's Thesaurus are listed conceptually rather than alphabetically . Although including synonyms , a thesaurus should not be taken as a complete list of all the synonyms for a particular word . The entries are also designed for drawing distinctions between similar words and assisting in choosing exactly the right word . Unlike a dictionary , a thesaurus entry does not define words . The word `` thesaurus '' is derived from 16th-century New Latin , in turn from Latin thesaurus , which is the latinisation of the Greek ' ( thÄ `` sauros ) , literally `` treasure store '' , generally meaning a collection of things which are of big importance or value ( and thus the medieval rank of thesaurer was a synonym for treasurer ) . This meaning has been largely supplanted by Roget 's usage of the term . In Information Science , Library Science , and Information Technology , specialized thesauri are designed for information retrieval . They are a type of controlled vocabulary , for indexing or tagging purposes . Such a thesaurus can be used as the basis of an index for online material . The Art and Architecture Thesaurus , for example , is used to index the Canadian Information retrieval thesauri are formally organized so that existing relationships between concepts are made explicit . As a result , they are more complex than simpler controlled vocabularies such as authority lists and synonym rings . Each term is placed in context , allowing a user to distinguish between `` bureau '' the office and `` bureau '' the furniture . Following international standards , they are generally arranged hierarchically by themes , topics or facets . Unlike a literary thesaurus , these specialized thesauri typically focus on one discipline , subject or field of study . In information technology , a thesaurus represents a database or list of semantically orthogonal topical search keys . In the field of Artificial Intelligence , a thesaurus may sometimes be referred to as an ontology . Terms are the basic semantic units for conveying concepts . They are usually single-word nouns , since nouns are the most concrete part of speech . Verbs can be converted to nouns -- `` cleans '' to `` cleaning '' , `` reads '' to `` reading '' , and so on . Adjectives and adverbs , however , seldom convey any meaning useful for indexing . When a term is ambiguous , a â scope noteâ can be added to ensure consistency , and give direction on how to interpret the term . Not every term needs a scope note , but their presence is of considerable help in using a thesaurus correctly and reaching a correct understanding of the given field of knowledge . `` Term relationships '' are links between terms . These relationships can be divided into three types : hierarchical , equivalency or associative . The ANSI\/NISO Z39 .19 Standard of 2005 defines guidelines and conventions for the format , construction , testing , maintenance , and management of monolingual controlled vocabularies including lists , synonym rings , taxonomies , and thesauruses . For multilingual vocabularies , the ISO 5964 Guidelines for the establishment and development of multilingual thesauri can be applied . Thesaurus Construction and Use : a practical manual .

The Bermuda Weather Service is Bermuda 's national meteorological service . It provides public , marine , tropical and aviation weather forecasts as well as warnings and climatolological services . The service began operations under contract from the Department of Airport Operations , Ministry of Transport and Tourism , in 1995 . Prior to that , the island 's meteorological services were provided by a US Navy base on the island .
Marc Ferrez ( December 7 , 1843 -- January 12 , 1923 ) was a Brazilian photographer born in Rio de Janeiro . Ferrez 's life was dedicated to the art of photography and he is considered one of the greatest photographers of his time . His production was massive , and his photographs document the consolidation of Brazil as a nation and Rio de Janeiro as a metropolis . His career was energized when he made part of Professor Charles Hartt 's Geological Commission which covered the north and south of the country . In 1865 Ferrez opened his own studio at Rua SÃ # o JosÃ , in the center of Rio de Janeiro , which was by that time the capital of the Brazilian empire . He was made Photographo da Marinha Imperial and his work with images increased through his life . He photographed Brazil from south to north , but paid more attention to his home city , Rio de Janeiro . His masterpieces are the great albums of railway constructions and the great panoramic views of the city of Rio de Janeiro and its quick development . Ferrez died in 1923 and left thousands of pictures and reproductions of his works .
Austin is a town in western Manitoba on the Trans-Canada Highway about 110 km ( 85 miles ) west of Winnipeg . It is part of the Rural Municipality of North Norfolk . It sits at the western edge of the table-flat Portage Plains , but to the south and west is surrounded by miles of low wooded hills known as the Carberry sandhills . The biggest attraction is the annual Rodeo and Threshermen 's Reunion held at the Manitoba Agricultural Museum the last four business days of July . Austin received its name in 1881 from the Marquis of Lorne , then Governor General of Canada while he was on a western tour during construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway . Many German immigrants of Mennonite religion moved in to the Austin Manitoba area . Ausin has 1 elementary school , 1 postal office , 1 curling\/hockey rink , 2 grocery stores and a Credit Union . The Reeve of Austin is Neil Christoferson .

South Shore is a city in Greenup County , Kentucky , United States . The population was 1,226 at the 2000 census . It is located along the Ohio River across from Portsmouth , Ohio , at the mouth of Tygarts Creek . South Shore is a part of the Huntington-Ashland , WV-KY-OH , Metropolitan Statistical Area ( MSA ) . The South Portsmouth-South Shore ( Amtrak station ) serves Amtrak 's Cardinal Trains 50 & 51 . South Shore was firsted settled in 1890 by the Fullerton , Warnock , and the Morton families from the nearby Tygarts Valley . Significant development occurred after the coming of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad and George D. Winn 's ferry to Portsmouth , Ohio in the 1890s . Winn began to petition for a post office in 1893 and on July 21 , the post office was established as Fullerton , after his brothers Harvey and Harrison Fullerton . The town was incorporated for a short period during 1919 . In 1895 , the Taylor brickyard was established near Fullerton by Clyde King and became the areas top employer . The Taylor name was applied to both the local railway station and the nearby McCall post office on January 16 , 1930 . This post office was then renamed South Shore on February 4 , 1940 . Shortly after the city of South Shore was incorporated on July 2 , 1957 , the Fullerton and South Shore post offices were consolidated under the South Shore name . South Shore eventually annexed the entire city of Fullerton , significantly expanding the its boundaries . South Shore is located at ( 38.721577 , -82.963606 ) . According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 0.8 square miles ( 2.1 kmÂ ) , of which , 0.6 square miles ( 1.7 kmÂ ) of it is land and 0.2 square miles ( 0.4 kmÂ ) of it ( 20.00 % ) is water . As of the census of 2000 , there were 1,226 people , 539 households , and 335 families residing in the city . The population density was 1,916.9 people per square mile ( 739.6 \/ kmÂ ) . There were 605 housing units at an average density of 945.9 \/ sq mi ( 365.0 \/ kmÂ ) . The racial makeup of the city was 97.55 % White , 0.16 % African American , 0.57 % Native American , 0.08 % Asian , 0.24 % from other races , and 1.39 % from two or more races . Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.24 % of the population . There were 539 households out of which 29.3 % had children under the age of 18 living with them , 44.0 % were married couples living together , 15.2 % had a female householder with no husband present , and 37.7 % were non-families . 34.7 % of all households were made up of individuals and 19.9 % had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older . The average household size was 2.17 and the average family size was 2.80 . In the city the population was spread out with 23.2 % under the age of 18 , 8.7 % from 18 to 24 , 24.9 % from 25 to 44 , 21.2 % from 45 to 64 , and 21.9 % who were 65 years of age or older . The median age was 39 years . For every 100 females there were 74.1 males . For every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 70.5 males . The median income for a household in the city was $ 18,214 , and the median income for a family was $ 25,197 . Males had a median income of $ 23,036 versus $ 20,833 for females . The per capita income for the city was $ 12,161 . About 22.4 % of families and 25.7 % of the population were below the poverty line , including 35.3 % of those under age 18 and 16.3 % of those age 65 or over . South Shore is the home of Graf Brothers Flooring and Lumber , the largest manufacturer of rift and quartered oak products in the world . Graf Bros employs approximately 275 people . In South Shore , Federal Officials are generally always voted Republican , while local and state are voted Democrat . Local representation includes Democrats Tanya Pullin in the Kentucky House of Representatives and Robin Webb in the Kentucky Senate . Pullin , a South Shore native , is the Chairman of the Seniors , Veterans , Military Affairs , and Public Protection Committee . The area is represented by Republican Geoff Davis in the United States House of Representatives and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and fellow Republican Rand Paul in the United States Senate .
Nasal hair or nose hair is the hair in the nose . Its main function is to keep foreign or unwanted particles from entering the lungs through the nasal cavity . Adult humans have hairs in the anterior nasal passage . Nasal hair should not be confused with cilia of the nasal cavity , which are the microscopic cellular strands that , unlike macroscopic nasal hair , draws mucus up toward the oropharynx via their coordinated , back-and-forth beating . A number of devices have been sold to trim the nose hair , including miniature rotary clippers , and attachments for electric shavers . The trimmers shorten the hair to such lengths so that they do not appear outside of the nasal passage . The removal of nasal hair by plucking can be painful , followed by a reaction of tearing eyes , sneezing and sometimes bleeding . These symptoms can be lessened if the plucking occurs in a situation where more warm moisture is present in the nasal passage ( e.g. after a shower or steam facial ) ; However , the pain associated with this method of nose hair removal can be a prohibitive factor to its removal for cosmetic purposes . Removal by hand can be less painful , though acquiring a firm grip on a single hair may prove prohibitively difficult for some . A pair of tweezers can be used which facilitates removal and an antiseptic cream applied after treatment on the end of a cotton-bud to reduce the risk of infection and soreness . Some sources suggest that removing nose hair by pulling can be extremely dangerous ( by causing a nasal infection that could travel to the brain ) . However , there is no scientific evidence that such danger actually exists and there are no known reports of humans having health problems because of hair plucking or pulling .
A running gag , or running joke is a literary device that takes the form of an amusing joke or a comical reference and appears repeatedly throughout a work of literature or other form of storytelling . Running gags can begin with an instance of unintentional humor that is repeated in variations as the joke grows familiar and audiences anticipate reappearances of the gag . The humor in a running gag may derive entirely from how often it is repeated , the ( in ) appropriateness of the situation in which the gag occurs , or setting up the audience to expect another occurrence of the joke and then substituting something else ( bait and switch ) . Running gags are found mostly in television shows , but also appear in other places , such as video games , films , books , and comic strips . A running gag can be verbal or visual and may `` convey social values by echoing belligerent speakers with a barrage of caricatured threats . '' ( e.g. - A character may present others with a proposition that is so ridiculous or outrageous it is likely to be self-mocking to the point where the original request has little or no chance of actually being carried out and results in a humorous effect . ) Occasionally , the characters themselves may be aware of the running gag and make humorous mention of it .

For the North American genus called `` cricket frogs '' , see Acris . The Cricket Frog ( Fejervarya ( Rana ) limnocharis ) is a species of frog found widely distributed in South Asia . Molecular studies of the species complex suggest that there may be multiple species involved . Very closely allied to Rana tigrina , from which it differs in its smaller size , half-webbed toes , slight development of the fringe on the fifth toe , and usually in the presence of a small outer metatarsal tubercle . The length and shape of the snout , the size of the inner metatarsal tubercle , and the relative length of the hind limbs and of the fourth toe vary to an extraordinary degree . The tibio-tarsal articulation usually reaches the eye , or between the latter and the end of the snout ; but in some specimens ( var . brevipalmata , from Pegu and S. India ) it reaches considerably beyond the end of the snout , and the foot measures two thirds the distance between the end of the snout and the vent Greenish or olive , with darker spots ; a light vertebral line or band frequently present ; sometimes a light line along the inner side of the leg ; sides of thighs black-marbled ; throat of male usually with two large black blotches , sometimes connected and forming a 'M ' . From snout to vent 2-5 inches . The species forms a complex with several genetic variants that may represent multiple species . A widely distributed species , extending from China and Southern Japan , throughout India , Ceylon , and Burma to the Malay Peninsula and Archipelago . In the Himalayas ( Sikkim ) it occurs up to 7000 feet . Stoliczka observed that it usually does not hesitate to take to the sea or brackish water . In West Pakistan it occurs in the Indus drainage from the delta north at least to Rawalpindi .
The 1977 Formula One season included the 28th FIA Formula One World Championship season , which commenced on January 9 , 1977 , and ended on October 23 after seventeen races . Niki Lauda took his second championship , though Mario Andretti won more races . Jody Scheckter 's Wolf won first time out , Shadow took their only victory , and Gunnar Nilsson achieved the only win of a career tragically cut short by cancer . Renault entered grand prix racing with a turbocharged car which was initially not very successful . The German ATS team took over the Penske cars and the South African Grand Prix was the last race a BRM ever qualified to start . The season was also marred by one of the most horrific accidents in Formula One history . During the South African GP on March 5 , TV cameras captured how Tom Pryce was unable to avoid 19-year-old race marshall Frederik Jansen Van Vuuren . The latter was killed by the terrifying collision , his bloody corpse was hurtled into the air , and his fire extinguisher killed and nearly decapitated Pryce , whose car proceeded to the end of the straight where it collided with Jacques Laffite 's Ligier . The 1977 season started in Argentina , and it was reigning world champion James Hunt who started off his title defense with pole position in his McLaren . Countryman John Watson shared the front row with him in the Brabham , and Patrick Depailler in the six-wheeled Tyrrell was third on the grid . Watson took the lead at the start with Hunt second . Watson led for the first 10 laps until Hunt moved ahead and pulled away , with Mario Andretti 's Lotus third , but soon the other McLaren of Jochen Mass took the place . Mass had to retire soon after with an engine failure which caused him to spin , and a suspension failure took teammate and race leader Hunt out three laps later . Watson took the lead again , but he also had suspension failures and let teammate Carlos Pace through . Watson eventually retired , and Pace struggled towards the end due to heat in his cockpit and was passed by Jody Scheckter 's Wolf and Andretti , but the latter retired then with a wheel bearing failure . Scheckter took the first win of 1977 , with Pace second , and home hero Carlos Reutemann completing the podium for Ferrari . The second round took place in Brazil , and Hunt took pole again with Reutemann second and Andretti third on the grid . Home hero Pace took the lead at the start , with Hunt dropping behind Reutemann as well but soon Hunt was back behind Pace and attacking . There was contact , and Hunt took the lead whereas Pace had to pit for repairs . Hunt led Reutemann until he began to suffer from tyre troubles and was passed by Reutemann . Hunt pitted for new tyres , and rejoined fourth and soon passed Niki Lauda in the Ferrari and Watson to reclaim second . Reutemann marched on to victory , Hunt was second and Lauda third after Watson crashed out . The race in South Africa was over a month later , but Hunt still continued his streak of poles , with Pace alongside and Lauda next . Hunt led off at the start , with Lauda and Scheckter following him after Pace struggled . The order stayed put until the seventh lap when Lauda took the lead and was never headed again , with Scheckter taking second from Hunt 11 laps later . Om lap 21 , two marshals ran on the track , the second one with a fire extinguisher after the Shadow of Renzo Zorzi failed . The second marshal , Fredrik Jansen van Vuuren was hit by the car of Tom Pryce and was killed instantly by the collision , whereas the fire extinguished flew off his hands and landed on Pryce 's face , killing and nearly decapitating him . The race continued however , and Lauda won , his first since his own horror crash last year , with home hero Scheckter second , and Depailler 's six-wheeler took third from Hunt in the closing laps . The death of Pryce had shaken the field up , and then before the next round , there was more bad news , as Carlos Pace , who had finished second in the opening round in Argentina , was killed in a plane crash . The field , in a somber mood , went to Long Beach in the USA , and Lauda took pole ahead of home hero Andretti , with Scheckter third . At the start , it was Scheckter who got the best start , and he passed both Andretti and Lauda , with Reutemann going up an escape road and spinning as he tried to follow Scheckter through . The top three of Scheckter , Andretti and Lauda pulled away from the rest of the pack , and ran closely together but the order did not change . However , a tyre began to deflate for Scheckter , and both Andretti and Lauda passed him with two laps left , with Andretti thus taking a popular home victory ahead of Lauda and a disappointed Scheckter . Constructors points were awarded on a 9-6-4-3-2-1 basis to the top six placegetters in each round with only the best placed car from each constructor eligible to score points . The best seven results from the first eight races and the best seven results from the remaining eight races were retained . Another Formula One race was also held in 1977 , which did not count towards the World Championship .

Bubble wrap is a pliable transparent plastic material commonly used for packing fragile items . Regularly spaced , protruding air-filled hemispheres ( bubbles ) provide cushioning for precious or breakable items . The term is also a brand of Sealed Air Corporation ( US ) . In 1957 two inventors named Alfred Fielding and Marc Chavannes were attempting to create a plastic wallpaper . Although the idea was a failure , they found that it did make for great packing material . Sealed Air Corp. was co-founded by Alfred Fielding in 1960 . Some people use the name generically for similar products , often termed air bubble packing or bubble wrapping ; Sealed Air denotes its product as a brand of `` cushioning material '' . The bubbles that provide the cushioning for fragile or sensitive objects are generally available in different sizes , depending on the size of the object being packed , as well as the level of cushioning protection that is needed . Multiple layers might be needed to provide shock and vibration isolation . A single layer might be used as a surface protective layer . They can be as small as 1\/4 inch ( 6 millimeters ) in diameter , to as large as an inch ( 26 millimeters ) or more , to provide added levels of shock absorption during transit . In addition to the degree of protection available from the size of the air bubbles in the plastic , the plastic material itself can offer some forms of protection for the object in question . For example , when shipping sensitive electronic parts and components , a type of Bubble Wrap is used that employs an anti-static plastic that dissipates static charge , thereby protecting the sensitive electronic chips from static which can damage them . Because bubble wrap makes a recognizable popping sound when compressed and punctured , it can be used as a source of amusement and to alleviate stress . Acknowledging this alternative use , some websites provide a virtual bubble wrap program which displays a sheet of bubble wrap that users may pop by clicking on the bubbles , while the Mugen Puchipuchi is a compact electronic toy simulating bubble wrap popping . Bubble Wrap Appreciation Day is celebrated on the last Monday of January .
Mykonos is a Greek island , part of the Cyclades , lying between Tinos , Syros , Paros and Naxos . The island spans an area of 85.5 k and rises to an elevation of 341 m at its highest point . The island is composed primarily of granite . It has little natural fresh water and relies on the desalination of sea water in order to meet the needs of its population . There are 9,320 inhabitants ( 2001 ) most of whom live in the largest town , Mykonos , also known as Chora ( i.e. the Town in Greek , a common denomination in Greece when the name of the island itself is the same as the name of the principal town ) , which lies on the west coast . Mykonos is one of the most cosmopolitan islands in Greece , known for its diverse and intense nightlife as evidenced by a vast number of bars and nightclubs . Mykonos is also known for its beaches . The island has an international airport , and is a frequent destination for cruise ships . Archaeological finds indicate that the Ionians settled on Mykonos in the early part of the 11th century BCE . More recent discoveries have uncovered remnants in Ftelia beach from the Neolithic Kares tribe dating back to as far as 3000 BC . In Greek mythology Mykonos was the location of the battle between Zeus and the Titans , and the island was named in honor of Apollo 's grandson Mykons . During these ancient times , Mykonos , due to its proximity to the then highly populated island of Delos ( situated about 2 k away ) , became very important as a supply island and possibly as a getaway location for Delian citizens . The island was once very poor , and the people tried to survive on fishing and stock breeding on the harsh land . A major industry was also ship construction . Tourism has turned the economy over since it started in the 1950s and the locals have a double attitude towards this : it may have saved the economy but some also feel that it has taken over too much . Mykonos is a separate peripheral unit of the South Aegean Periphery , and the only municipality of the peripheral unit . As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform , the peripheral unit Mykonos was created out of the former Cyclades Prefecture . The municipality , unchanged at the Kallikratis reform , also includes the islands Delos , Rineia and several uninhabited islets . The total area of the municipality is 105.2 k.
For computer network models , see network topology , packet generation model and channel model . The network model is a database model conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their relationships . Its distinguishing feature is that the schema , viewed as a graph in which object types are nodes and relationship types are arcs , is not restricted to being a hierarchy or lattice . The network model 's original inventor was Charles Bachman , and it was developed into a standard specification published in 1969 by the CODASYL Consortium . Where the hierarchical database model structures data as a tree of records , with each record having one parent record and many children , the network model allows each record to have multiple parent and child records , forming a generalized graph structure . This property applies at two levels : the schema is a generalized graph of record types connected by relationship types ( called `` set types '' in CODASYL ) , and the database itself is a generalized graph of record occurrences connected by relationships ( CODASYL `` sets '' ) . Cycles are permitted at both levels . The chief argument in favor of the network model , in comparison to the hierarchic model , was that it allowed a more natural modeling of relationships between entities . Although the model was widely implemented and used , it failed to become dominant for two main reasons . Firstly , IBM chose to stick to the hierarchical model with semi-network extensions in their established products such as IMS and DL\/I . Secondly , it was eventually displaced by the relational model , which offered a higher-level , more declarative interface . Until the early 1980s the performance benefits of the low-level navigational interfaces offered by hierarchical and network databases were persuasive for many large-scale applications , but as hardware became faster , the extra productivity and flexibility of the relational model led to the gradual obsolescence of the network model in corporate enterprise usage . In 1969 , the Conference on Data Systems Languages ( CODASYL ) established the first specification of the network database model . This was followed by a second publication in 1971 , which became the basis for most implementations . Subsequent work continued into the early 1980s , culminating in an ISO specification , but this had little influence on products .

SociÃ tÃ Aigle Azur Transports AÃ riens is an airline based in Tremblay-en-France , France , near Paris . It operates domestic scheduled passenger services and international services to Algeria , Morocco , Tunisia in North Africa as well as Portugal , Italy and Mali . It also operates charter , cargo and wet lease services . Its main bases are Orly Airport and Charles de Gaulle Airport , Paris . Aigle Azur is also accredited by IATA with the IATA Operational Safety Audit ( IOSA ) for its safety practices . In April 1946 , Sylvain Floirat established the original Aigle Azur as one of the first wholly privately owned , independent airlines in post-war France . Between 1946 and 1955 , the airline operated a large fleet of Douglas DC-3s . During the early 1950s , Aigle Azur began operating long-haul scheduled routes linking metropolitan France with Africa and the Asia-Pacific region . France 's Ministry of Public Works and Transport had transferred Air France 's traffic rights for these routes to the country 's newly created independent airlines , including Aigle Azur . In 1970 , the airline was re-constituted as a regional airline named Lucas Aviation . The re-formed airline 's corporate and operational headquarters was at Paris Pontoise Airport , located in Boissy l'Aillerie . Lucas Aviation initially traded as Lucas Air Transport and operated regional scheduled services , including a year-round operation linking Deauville with London Gatwick . The name subsequently changed once more to Lucas Aigle Azur . In May 2001 , Groupe GOFAST acquired Lucas Aigle Azur from its previous owners , once again changing the name to Aigle Azur , its original name . The new owner refocused the airline as a mainstream short - to medium-haul scheduled and charter carrier . Aigle Azur began replacing its Boeing 737s with Airbus A320 family aircraft . It has 450 employees as of May 2007 . As of January 2011 , the Aigle Azur fleet consists of the following aircraft with an average age of 9.8 years : There were several hull-loss accidents involving Aigle Azur aircraft between 1949 and 1954 , most of which took place in French Indochina , today 's Laos or Vietnam . A plane operated by France 's Aigle Azur landed in Baghdad on 31-10-2010 becoming the first flight from a European airline to arrive in the city since a 1990 international embargo on Iraq after 20 years .

In 2005 he achieved his best ever result in an ATP Masters Series event , knocking out Andy Roddick on his way to the semi-finals at Montreal . He had a record of 2 â `` 2 in the 4 Davis Cup matches he played that year . He won both his matches against the Swedish opponents Thomas Johansson and Joachim Johansson , but lost to Russia 's Nikolay Davydenko and Igor Andreev in the quarter final tie . 2006 saw him equal his best result at a Grand Slam tournament by reaching the 4th round of the Australian Open . In May a career-high ranking of 32 was attained . In the 3rd round of the French Open , he lost to eventual champion Rafael Nadal in a gruelling encounter which lasted 4 hours and 53 minutes , but amazingly only saw 42 games played ( Nadal won the match 5 â `` 7 , 6 â `` 4 , 6 â `` 4 , 6 â `` 4 , with the first set lasting 93 minutes and each of the following sets longer than an hour ) . Many tennis players and commentators , including two-time French Open runner-up Ã lex Corretja , hailed it as a classic . Mathieu is known for being able to hit heavy groundstrokes from both wings and his topspin forehand is probably his biggest weapon . A relatively popular , well-liked player despite his inconsistent career results , Mathieu is often affectionately known by his initials , `` PHM '' . His favorite surfaces are clay and hard , and he admired Boris Becker while growing up . His brother Pierre-Yves is now a tennis coach in Strasbourg . 2007 started poorly for Mathieu when he injured himself at the Australian Open during a 1st round encounter against Spaniard Fernando Verdasco and was forced to retire from the match . This was unfortunate as Mathieu was up 2 sets and 3 â `` 0 in the 3rd set tiebreak at the time . After returning from his injury , he reached the 4th round in Miami , beating then world number 5 Fernando GonzÃ lez of Chile along the way , before bowing out to Andy Murray in 3 sets . On April 29 , 2007 , Mathieu won his 3rd career title , the Grand Prix Hassan II in Casablanca defeating Ã lbert MontaÃ Ã s 6 â `` 1 6 â `` 1 . At Wimbledon , he reached round 4 for the first time , defeating Radek Å tÄ pÃ nek , # 17 seed ( 15th-ranked ) David Ferrer , and 15th seed ( 12th-ranked ) Ivan LjubiÄ iÄ . He attained a career high ranking of 28 in singles after this result , entering the world 's top 30 for the first time . The week after Wimbledon , he beat Italian Andreas Seppi 6 â `` 7 ( 1 ) , 6 â `` 3 , 7 â `` 5 in a difficult final to claim his fourth ATP Tour title in Gstaad , Switzerland . He rose to # 23 in the rankings , making his top 25 breakthrough . At the Montreal Masters , he produced one of the comebacks of the season to beat 15th seed Guillermo CaÃ as . Trailing 4 â `` 6 0 â `` 4 , he managed to up his level of play to win 13 of the next 14 games and record a win by the score of 4 â `` 6 7 â `` 5 6 â `` 0 . He followed that up with a win over Mario AnÄ iÄ in round 2 . In round 3 , he ran into Rafael Nadal , and actually won the first set 6 â `` 3 before losing the next two 6 â `` 3 6 â `` 2 . He then made the semi-finals of New Haven losing to world number 6 James Blake in a 3rd set tiebreak . This result projected him in the world 's top 20 for the 1st time , at the 20th rank .

The muscle of the soft palate play important roles in swallowing and breathing . The squirrel monkeys are the New World monkeys of the genus Saimiri . They are the only genus in the subfamily Saimirinae . Squirrel monkeys live in the tropical forests of Central and South America in the canopy layer . Most species have parapatric or allopatric ranges in the Amazon , while S. oerstedii is found disjunctly in Costa Rica and Panama . Squirrel monkey fur is short and close , colored olive at the shoulders and yellowish orange on its back and extremities . Their throat and the ears are white and their mouths are black . The upper part of their head is hairy . This black-and-white face gives them the name `` death 's head monkey '' in several Germanic languages ( e.g. , German Totenkopfaffen , Swedish dÃ dskalleapor , Dutch doodshoofdaapjes ) and Slovenian ( smrtoglavka ) . Squirrel monkeys grow to 25 to 35 cm , plus a 35 to 42 cm tail . Male squirrel monkeys weigh 750 to 1100 g. Females weigh 500 to 750 g. Remarkably , the brain mass to body mass ratio for squirrel monkeys is 1:17 , which gives them the largest brain , proportionately , of all the primates . Humans have a 1:35 ratio . Female squirrel monkeys have a pseudo-penis that they use to display dominance over smaller monkeys , in much the same way the male squirrel monkeys display their dominance . Like most of their New World monkey relatives , squirrel monkeys are diurnal and arboreal . Unlike the other New World monkeys , their tail is not used for climbing , but as a kind of `` balancing pole '' and also as a tool . Their movements in the branches can be very rapid . They live together in multi-male\/multi-female groups with up to 500 members . These large groups can , however occasionally break into smaller troops . They have a number of vocal calls , including warning sounds to protect themselves from large falcons , which are a natural threat to them . Their small body size also makes them susceptible to predators such as snakes and felids . For marking territory , squirrel monkeys rub their tail and their skin with their own urine . Squirrel monkeys are omnivores , eating primarily fruits and insects . Occasionally they also eat seeds , leaves , flowers , buds , nuts , eggs and small vertebrates . The mating of the squirrel monkeys is subject to seasonal influences . Females give birth to young during the rainy season , after a 150 - to 170-day gestation . The mothers exclusively care for the young . Saimiri oerstedti are weaned by 4 months of age , while S. boliviensis are not fully weaned until 18 months old . Female squirrel monkeys reach sexual maturity at age 3 years , while males take until age 5 . They live to about 15 years old in the wild , about 20 years in captivity . The Common Squirrel Monkey S. sciureus is captured for the pet trade and for medical research but it is not threatened . Two squirrel monkey species are threatened : S. oerstedti and S. vanzolinii are listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN . Until 1984 , all South American squirrel monkeys were generally considered part of a single widespread species , and many zoologists considered the Central American Squirrel Monkey to be a member of that single species as well . The two main groups currently recognized can be separated by the white above the eyes ; it being shaped as a Gothic ( `` pointed '' ) Arch in the S. sciureus group , while it is shaped as a Roman ( `` rounded '' ) Arch in the S. boliviensis group . The rown lineages for the extant squirrel monkeys appearo to have diverged around 1.5 million years ago . S. boliviensis appears to be the first diverging species in the group . S. oerstedii and S. s. sciureus , are sister species . S. s. macrodon is the sister species to the S. oerstedii \/ S. s. sciureus clade . Color vision in squirrel monkeys has been extensively studied as a stand-in for human ailments . In humans , two genes for color vision are found on the X chromosome . Typically , one gene ( OPN1LW ) produces a pigment that is most sensitive to the 564 nm wavelength , while the other gene ( OPN1MW ) produces pigment most sensitive to 534 nm . In squirrel monkeys , there is only one gene on the X chromosome but it exists in three varieties : one is most sensitive to 538 nm , one to 551 nm , and one to 561 nm . Since males have only one X chromosome , they are dichromatic , although with different sensitivites . Females , on the other hand , have two X chromosomes , so some of them can have copies of two different alleles . The three alleles seem to be equally common , leading to one-third of females being dichromatic while two-thirds are trichromatic .

Putrajaya ( Jawi : Ú Ù Ø Ø Ø Ø Ø Ù ) is a planned city , located south of Kuala Lumpur , that serves as the federal administrative center of Malaysia . The seat of government was shifted in 1999 from Kuala Lumpur due to the overcrowding and congestion there . Nevertheless , Kuala Lumpur remains as Malaysia 's national capital ( as the seat of Parliament ) as well as the country 's commercial and financial center . Putrajaya was the brainchild of former Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohammad who was in power then . In 2001 , Putrajaya was made a Federal Territory , increasing the number of federal territories to three . Kuala Lumpur and Labuan are the other two . Named after the first Malaysian Prime Minister , Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra , the city is situated within the Multimedia Super Corridor , beside the also newly developed Cyberjaya . The development started in 1995 and today major landmarks are completed and the population is expected to grow in the relatively new city . The `` jaya '' ( à à ) part of the city 's name means `` victory '' in Sanskrit . The vision to have a new Federal Government Administrative Centre to replace Kuala Lumpur as the administrative capital emerged in the late 1980s , during the tenure of Malaysia 's 4th Prime Minister , Dr. Mahathir Bin Mohamad . The new city was proposed to be located between Kuala Lumpur and the new KL International Airport ( KLIA ) . The Federal government negotiated with the state of Selangor on the prospect of another Federal Territory and in the mid-1990s , the Federal government paid a substantial amount of money to Selangor for approximately 11 320 acres ( 46 kmÂ ) of land in Prang Besar , Selangor . As a result of this land purchase , the state of Selangor now completely surrounds two Federal Territories within its borders , namely Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya . Planned as the garden and intelligent city , 38 % of the area is reserved for green areas by emphasizing the enhancement of natural landscape . A network of open spaces and wide boulevards were incorporated to the plan . Construction began in August 1995 and it was Malaysia 's biggest project and one of Southeast Asia 's largest with estimated final cost of US$ 8.1 billion . The entire project was designed and constructed by Malaysian companies with only 10 % of the materials imported . The Asian Financial Crisis of 1997\/1998 had somewhat slowed the development of Putrajaya . In 1999 , 300 staff members of the Prime Minister 's office moved to Putrajaya and the remaining government servants moved in 2005 . On February 1 , 2001 Tun Dr. Mahathir declared Putrajaya as a Federal Territory with the ceremony of handing over Putrajaya township from the Selangor state authorities . In 2002 , a high speed rail link called KLIA Transit was opened , linking Putrajaya to both Kuala Lumpur and KL International Airport in Sepang . However , construction of the Putrajaya Monorail which was intended to be the city 's metro system , was suspended due to costs . One of the monorail suspension bridges in Putrajaya remains unused . In 2007 , the population of Putrajaya was estimated to be over 30,000 , which comprised mainly government servants . This is a list of bridges in Putrajaya .

Patricio Rey y Sus Redonditos de Ricota ( Patrick King and his Curd Roundies in English ) were an independent rock band originally from La Plata , Argentina whose tours in the 1980s , 1990s and 2000s drew a cult-like following . Patricio Rey is a fictional character or group consciousness , and not a real person or member of the group . `` El Indio '' Solari , lead singer , embodies the one-man-show mystique followed by his powerful guitar player Skay Beilinson . Other members of the group have left the band and have been replaced ( drums : `` Piojo '' Abalos ; saxophone : `` Willy '' Crook ; guitar : `` Tito '' Fargo D'Aviero ) . The members of the group were reluctant to do any interviews during their career . The band 's strength lies in the semantic power of its lyrics , which discuss different topics such as politics , drugs and women , but always from a philosophical and existential point of view . The band broke up after the release of Momo Sampler , but several former members are still active and pursuing solo careers . In 2005 , the band received the Konex Award as best Rock Group of the 1995-2005 decade , distinction shared with Divididos .

His mother governed in his place , and even after reaching adulthood , Charles Emmanuel continued a life of pleasure , far away from the affairs of state . He became notorious for his persecution of the Vaudois ( Waldensians ) culminating in the massacre of 1655 . The massacre was so brutal that it prompted the English poet John Milton to write the sonnet On the Late Massacre in Piedmont . Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell called for a general fast in England and proposed to send the British Navy if the massacre was not stopped while gathering funds for helping the Waldensians . Sir Samuel Morland was commissioned with that task . He later wrote The History of the Evangelical Churches of the Valleys of Piemont ( 1658 ) . Only after the death of his mother in 1663 , he really assumed power .

Calibrachoa is a genus of plants in the Solanaceae ( nightshade ) family . They are weak evergreen short-lived perennials and subshrubs with a sprawling habit , and they have small petunia-type flowers . They are found across much the same region of South America as petunias , from southern Brazil across to Peru and Chile . Calibrachoa are closely related to the petunia . However on further examination it has been found that there are major differences in chromosomes , corresponding to external differences and fertilization factors that distinguished Calibrachoa from the petunias . Calibrachoa is named after Antonio de la Cal y Bracho , a 19th century Mexican botanist and pharmacologist . Some of these are kept as ornamental plants . The plants can tolerate light frost and thrive in sun or semi-shade . Plant in a free-draining soil and water only when the soil is almost dry . Propagate from tip cuttings .

The Euclidean algorithm is an algorithm . It can be used to find the biggest number that divides two other numbers ( the greatest common divisor of two numbers ) . Euclid solved the problem graphically . He said If you have two distances , AB and CD , and you always take away the smaller from the bigger , you will end up with a distance that measures both of them . Start out with two integers a and b. Let m have the same value as a , and n have the same value as b. Note : This pseudocode uses modular arithmetic instead of subtraction . It does the same thing as above , but gets the answer faster .

In physics , power ( symbol : P ) is the rate at which work is performed or energy is transferred . In the SI system of measurement , power is measured in watts ( symbol : W ) . It may take a certain amount of work to effect a change in the world , like lifting a heavy weight to a higher level . It makes no difference if the weight is lifted slowly or quickly , the same amount of work will have been performed . The difference between a slow lift and a quick lift is that a quick lift requires more Power . That is the work can be done in a shorter time if there is more power available . where P is power W is work t is time . Power is also equal to force times velocity ( or speed ) . In optics , or radiometry , the term power sometimes refers to radiant flux , the average rate of energy transport by electromagnetic radiation , measured in watts . But the term `` power '' is also used to express the ability of a lens or other optical device to focus light . It is measured in dioptres ( inverse metres ) , and is equal to one over the focal length of the optical device .

Pharmacoepidemiology studies the use and effects of drugs on large groups of people and patients . It assesses probability of beneficial and adverse effects , and risks for humans while using a particular drug . Pharmacoepidemiology bridges pharmacology and epidemiology and borrows their methodology from both of them . It uses descriptive epidemiological method by describing exposure to a drug and by calculating rates , e.g. , incidence and prevalence . Such descriptive method generates hypothesis about influence of the drug , but does not test it . Pharmacoepidemiology also uses analytic epidemiological method by means of observation ( case-control and cohort studies ) and experimentation ( clinical trial ) . The analytic study compares an exposed group with a control group and serves as testing of the hypothesis . Pharmacoepidemiology provides pharmacovigilance , the later is a type of continual monitoring of unwanted effects and other safety-related aspects of drugs in current growing integrating markets . Pharmacovigilance is conducted by spontaneous reporting systems through health care professionals and others which report adverse drug reactions to the central agency . The central agency combines reports from many sources to produce a more informative profile for drug products .

Sinodelphys is an extinct mammal from the Lower Cretaceous . It is a member of the infraclass Metatheria , the group which contains modern marsupials . To date , it is the oldest metatherian fossil known , estimated to be 125 million years old . This makes it almost contemporary to the earliest placental fossils , which have been found in the same area . It was discovered and described in 2003 in rocks of the Yixian Formation in Liaoning Province , China , by a team of scientists . Sinodelphys szalayi grew only 15 cm ( 5.9 in ) long and possibly weighed about 30 g ( 1.05 oz ) . Its fossilized skeleton is surrounded by impressions of fur and soft tissue , thanks to the exceptional sediment that preserves such details . From its foot structure it is thought that Sinodelphys was a tree-dweller , like its non-marsupial contemporary Eomaia and modern opossums such as Didelphis . Sinodelphys probably hunted worms and insects . Most Mesozoic metatherians have been found in North America and Asia . Most lived during the Upper Cretaceous between 90-65 million years ago .

Outflow is a term for the air that flows away from a thunderstorm . Lots of outflow show that a storm is `` healthy '' . The `` edge '' of the outflow boundary can often be detected by weather radar . Convergence occurs along the leading edge of the downdraft . Convergence of dust , aerosols , and bugs at the leading edge will lead to a higher clear air signature . The signature of the leading edge is also influenced by the density change between the cold air from the downdraft and the warm environmental air . This density boundary will increase the number of echo returns from the leading edge . Clouds , hydrometeors and new thunderstorms can also develop along the outflow 's leading edge . This makes it possible to locate the outflow boundary when using precipitation mode . The image to the right depicts a particularly strong ouflow boundary ahead of a line of storms . Often , the outflow boundary will bow in the direction it is moving the quickest .

Religious segregation is the idea that people should be separated based on their religion . Certain laws of a country may only apply to one religious group . As an example , Sharia only applies to Muslims . The term religious apartheid has also been used . Apartheid was the term used to refer to racial segregation in South Africa . Other examples for religious segregation are that in Iran , certain students have been expelled from university because they were not Muslims , but Baha ` i . According to the Times Higher Education , BahÃ ' Ã are required to give up their faith in order to teach in Iranian universities . BahÃ ' Ã is not among the recognized `` recognized religious minorities '' in the Constitution of Iran . The BahÃ ' Ã faith is considered apostate in Iran because it believes in a prophet ( BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h ) more recent than Muhammad . This goes against Islamic teachings , which teach the belief that Muhammad is the last and final messenger sent to mankind . Saudi Arabia sees the cities of Mecca and Medina as holy . Only Muslims may enter or travel through these cities . A Non-Muslim who enters one of them may be fined . People who are not Muslims will be deported from Mecca .

The scale was developed in 1805 by Sir Francis Beaufort . There are twelve levels , plus 0 for `` no wind '' . From 1946 to 1970 , there were also beaufort levels 13 to 17 . All of them were labeled as Hurricane . Because they were only used in special cases , they are no longer in use internationally . China and Taiwan still use them , because they often have typhoons . The wave heights given are for waves on the open ocean , not near the shore .

Monolophosaurus ( meaning one-crested lizard ) was a medium-sized meat-eater from China that lived during the Jurassic Period . It had lots of sharp teeth and a big , skinny head . It also had one feature not found on any other meat-eating dinosaur - a long , bony ridge that went from its nose back to the top of its head . The area where Monolophosaurus was discovered showed signs that it was sometimes covered with water , so it is possible that this dinosaur lived on the shore of a lake or sea . The remains of the type of Monolophosaurus preserve a complete skull and partial postcranium ( Zhao & Currie , 1994 ) . In fact , these remains are amongst the most complete from the Middle Jurassic of China ( Rauhut , 2003 ) . A recent phylogenetic analysis ( Rauhut , 2003 ) places Monolophosaurus as the basalmost member of the Allosauroidea .

Kavelaars using the 200-inch Hale telescope , together with Caliban and given the designation S\/1997 U 2 . Officially confirmed as Uranus XVII , it was named after Sycorax , Caliban 's mother in William Shakespeare 's play The Tempest . Sycorax follows a far orbit , more than 20 times farther from Uranus than the farthest regular moon Oberon . Its orbit is retrograde , moderately inclined and eccentric . The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong , together with Setebos and Prospero , to the same dynamic cluster , suggesting common origin . The diagram illustrates the orbital parameters of the retrograde non-spherical moons of Uranus ( in polar co-ordinates ) with the eccentricity of the orbits represented by the segments extending from the pericentre to the apocentre . The diameter of Sycorax is estimated at 150 km ( assuming albedo of 0.04 ) making it the biggest non-spherical moon of Uranus , comparable in size with Himalia , the biggest non-spherical moon of Jupiter .

The continuum hypothesis is a hypothesis that there is no set that is both bigger than that of the natural numbers and smaller than that of the real numbers . Georg Cantor stated this hypothesis in 1877 . There are infinitely many natural numbers , the cardinality of the set of natural numbers is infinite . This is also true for the set of real numbers , but there are more real numbers than natural numbers . We say that the natural numbers have infinite cardinality and the real numbers have infinite cardinality , but the cardinality of the real numbers is greater than the cardinality of the natural numbers . This hypothesis is the first problem on the list of 23 problems David Hilbert published in 1900 . Kurt GÃ del showed in 1939 , that the hypothesis can not be falsified using Zermeloâ `` Fraenkel set theory . The Zermeloâ `` Fraenkel set theory is the set theory commonly used in mathematics . Paul Cohen showed in the 1960s that the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory can not be use to prove the continuum hypothesis , either . For this , Cohen was awarded the Fields medal .
A slide projector is an instrument to view photographic slides . A flat piece of heat absorbing glass is often placed between the condensing lens and the slide , to avoid damaging the slide . This glass absorbs infrared . Light passes through the transparent slide and lens , and the resulting image is enlarged and projected onto a screen . So the audience can view its reflection . The image may be projected onto a translucent `` rear projection '' screen . That is used for continuous automatic display for close viewing . This form of projection also avoids that people who look at the show interrupt the light stream or bump into the projector . Slide projectors were common in the 1950s and 1960s as a form of entertainment ; family members and friends would gather to view slideshows . In-home photographic slides and slide projectors have largely been replaced by low cost paper prints , digital cameras , DVD media , video display monitors and digital projectors . As of October 2004 , Kodak no longer manufactures slide projectors . It is also increasingly difficult in some countries to locate photo processors who will process slide film .

A screenwriter is a person who writes the screenplay ( or script ) for a movie or television show - that is , a screenwriter writes the words that the actors and actresses speak . A script conveys the dialogue of the movie , and will briefly describe visuals , although not too much , as this is left up to the director . There are certain rules as to how to format a movie script . If these are not followed , then it is highly unlikely that it will ever be taken seriously . In order to test the effectiveness of a script , actors will do a first reading of it . If the format is not clear , then it will probably cause the actors confusion , and will make the task very difficult to complete .

Ornithopods are the bird-footed or duck-billed dinosaurs . They are the sister group to the armored dinosaurs ( Thyreophora ) . The duck-bills started out as small , bipedal running browsers , and grew in size and numbers . They became one of the most successful groups of herbivores in the Cretaceous world , and dominated the landscape . Their major evolutionary advantage was the evolution of a sophisticated chewing apparatus . They had multiple tooth rows , cheek pouches and true chewing . This was the best ever developed by a reptile , rivalling that of modern mammals like the domestic cow . Members are known from all seven continents , though mostly in North America and Eurasia . Their success is a little surprising , as they have little apparent defense against theropod carnivores . They did , however , have a horny beak and some cartilage rib plates . Iguanadons were very robust ( strong ) , and armed with a dagger-like thumb . Most authors have suggested herding as a defense .

Metatheria is a group in the class Mammalia which contains the marsupials and the sparassodonts . First proposed by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1880 , it is nearly synonymous with the earlier taxon Marsupialia , but it also contains the nearest fossil relatives of marsupial mammals . The earliest known representative , Sinodelphys , is from the Lower Cretaceous of China . The closest relatives of the metatheres are the Eutheria ( also erected by Huxley in 1880 ) . Both are conventionally united as infraclasses within the subclass Theria , which contains all living mammals except monotremes . During development , metatherians produce a yolk sac placenta and give birth to ` larval-like ' offspring . These offspring have underdeveloped rear limbs , and after birth they migrate to the marsupium where they attach to a nipple . The mouth of newly born metatherians forms an `` O '' shape into which the mother 's nipple fits . Then it swells to secure the offspring into place . The Greek words meta - and theria roughly means the `` other beasts '' , in contrast with Eutheria ( `` true beasts '' ) . Metatherians first appeared in the Cretaceous period . Some stem groupstem metatherians persisted well into the Neogene period before becoming extinct . Crown group marsupials , the one branch of Metatheria that survives today , diversified close to the time of extinction at the end of the Cretaceous .

The order includes about 2500-2800 species from 85-90 genera , which comprise seven families of trees and shrubs . Most of the species are tropical and subtropical , though a few genera reach the temperate zone . The best known species in this order are those of the Lauraceae ( for example bay laurel or Laurus , cinnamon or Cinnamomum , avocado or Persea , and Sassafras ) , and the spice bush or Calycanthus of the Calycanthaceae . The earliest lauraceous fossils are from to the early Cretaceous . It is possible that the ancient origin of this order is one of the reasons for its highly diverged morphology . Indeed , presently no single morphological property is known , which would unify all the members of Laurales . This fact used to cause much argument among botanists regarding the correct circumscription of the order , and the presently accepted classification is based on recent molecular and genetic analysis .

Most Requests for adminship run for seven days after being added onto the main RfA page . However , in certain circumstances they are closed early . If you are reading this page it is likely that this has happened to your RfA . Although RfA has no exact minimum requirements , the community requires a certain quality of changing pages . Without this , an RfA is certain to fail . When a candidate fails to meet a number of community-accepted criteria , sometimes everyone begins to give opposing comments . This can be discouraging for the candidate and stop them from more good contributions . This is clearly not good for Wikipedia . Also , an RfA that is clearly going to fail will often provoke a number of calls for early closure and associated discussion . Any editor in good standing may close a clearly failing RfA . However this should be done carefully and wisely . If there is any doubt , posting to the candidate 's talkpage and asking them about their RfA is often a better course of action than suddenly closing their good faith attempt at adminship . Any candidate who sees that their RfA is failing may make a request for it to be closed early . Simply strike through your acceptance of the RfA and note that you withdraw .
A padded cell is a special room in a hospital for mentally ill people . It 's made so that the patients can be put there when they go through a crisis ( or they have a fit or seizure ) . They are put there so they can go through their crisis on their own , without putting others into danger . Padded cells are made in special ways so that those having the crisis can not hurt themselves . Padded cells have been used for a long time in psychiatry . In the 1980s , their use declined in Europe . This is because there are drugs that can be given that make them nearly unnecessary . They are still widely used , especially in Africa and Asia . Seizures and crises are usually very tiring . For this reason , patients usually only spend a short time in these cells . They usually collapse because of fatigue rather quickly . When they do , they need medical attention quickly . You go in these rooms if you are mentally stupid .

Detection probably comes from the fact that they are affected by gravity .

Polyphyly is a term in cladistics . It describes a group of organisms whose last common ancestor is not a member of the group . Polyphyly : Greek for ` of many races ' . More common in traditional taxonomy is to include all descendants ( say , living mammals ) without the group they evolved from ( which would be some clade in the therapsida ) .

According to cladistics it should be the aim of classification to ensure that all groups are monophyletic . However , other taxonomists argue that there is a valid place for groups that are paraphyletic , contain their most recent common ancestor but does not all the descendants of that ancestor .

Carl Erich Correns ( 10 September 1864 â `` 14 February 1933 ) was a German botanist and geneticist . His research into heredity led to his rediscovery of Gregor Mendel 's earlier work , independently of Hugo de Vries . He grew hybrids of peas , and of maize , and reached the same interpretation as Mendel in 1899 . The occurrence of cases in which the heterozygote is intermediate ( the absence of dominance ) was added in a footnote to his 1900 paper . That dominance was not always present had been seen and understood by Mendel , according to his letters to NÃ geli . By a quirk of history Correns was a student of NÃ geli , a renowned botanist with whom Mendel corresponded about his work with peas . NÃ geli failed to understand how significant Mendel 's work was . In 1913 Correns became the first director of the newly founded Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin-Dahlem . Correns produced the first evidence of cytoplasmic inheritance , in his 1909 paper on variegated leaf color in Mirabilis jalapa . The basis of this inheritance is that chloroplasts , the organelles which conduct photosynthesis , are inherited solely from the maternal parent .

The population density of a country or city is a way of showing how crowded that place is . It is calculated by dividing the population by the area . For example , France has a population of 60,561,200 , and an area of 551,695 square kilometres , so its population density is about 109.8 persons per square kilometre . A number of factors can affect population density . For example , the climate . Greenland has a very low population density because it is very cold there , so not many people want to live there . Many cities were built near rivers , because the first settlers wanted somewhere close to water to start a society , so you could say areas around rivers usually have a high population density . Some places , such as cities , have very high population densities , so they are quite crowded . The population density of New York City is 10,292 persons per square kilometre . Other places , such as large countries , can have very low population densities . The population density of Canada is only 3.5 persons per square kilometre because it is such a big country . The country with the highest population density in the world is Monaco , with 16,620 persons per square kilometre . The country with the lowest is Greenland , which has only 0.03 persons per square kilometre .

Non-ionizing radiation ( or , esp . in British English , non-ionising radiation ) means any type of electromagnetic radiation that does not carry enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules - that is , to completely remove an electron from an atom or molecule . The composition of this radiation can vary depending on what may be ionized . Visible light , near ultraviolet , infrared , microwave and radio waves are all examples of non-ionizing radiation , though visible and near ultraviolet can also ionize some molecules . The light from the Sun that reaches the earth is largely composed of non-ionizing radiation , with the notable exception of some ultraviolet rays . However , most ionizing radiation is filtered out by the atmosphere . Because it is lower energy radiation , the use of this type of radiation in medical fields and everyday life poses fewer health risks than ionizing radiation in forms such as X-rays .

The Shanghai Fugu Agreement was a successful political prank which was landed on the Social Democrats in the German state of Hesse in 1985 . In 1985 the new Green Party prepared to enter into a German state government for the first time in its history . The first green cabinet minister in German history was going to be Joschka Fischer who later became minister of Foreign Affairs in the German Federal Government under chancellor Gerhard Schroeder . The 1985 Hesse coalition was to be based on an official policy agreement negotiated by both parties . During a final night session of the negotiations the Greens tabled a demand that Hesse join the `` Shanghai Fugu Agreement '' . This was accepted by their tired Social Democratic counterparts and became official state policy . The Greens argued that the fugu fish is well known to be a dangerous delicacy requiring specialised chefs who mostly come from Asia . Due to expanding restrictions on work permits restaurants have found it difficult to employ such specialists . The `` Shanghai Fugu Agreement '' provides special regulations for certified fugu chefs internationally . The agreement was absolutely fictional but was neither discovered to be a joke by the Social Democrats during the nightly negotiations nor later by civil servants or the press who went through the coalition contracts . It took years to be discovered as the joke it was .

It was originally called Mistake Out and was invented by Bette Nesmith Graham in 1951 , who was working at a bank in the U.S. state of Texas at time and had trouble when she typed on the typewriter , which was part of her job . She made in product in her blender and sold it to friends starting in 1956 . She sold the product to the Gillette Corporation for 47.5 million US Dollars in 1979 . When she died the following year , her son , Michael Nesmith , a famous musician , formally of The Monkees inherited the fortune . Now people still use the correction fluid , but more seldom . With more advanced technology , people have computers allowing them to backspace easily , not needing to use it . Also , there is also another recent invention of the correction tape . To use the fluid , you squeeze the bottle , and let to fluid flow out to cover the mistakes . Usually you have to shake the bottle before using it , and after using , you need to wait for it to dry for a few minutes , which is considered quite fast . Then you can write on top of the dried fluid .

Reverse DNS lookup ( rDNS ) is the process of determining the hostname or the host computer associated with a given IP address or any other type of network address . Typically , the Domain Name System is used to determine what IP address is associated with a given domain name . So , to `` reverse-resolve '' a known IP address to determine the hostname is simply the process of searching what host and domain name belongs to that IP address . A reverse lookup is often referred to as reverse resolving , or more specifically reverse DNS lookup , and is accomplished using a `` reverse IN-ADDR entry '' in the form of a PTR record . RFC 1033 in the `` INSTRUCTIONS '' section , and later , RFC 1912 Section 2.1 states `` Every Internet-reachable host should have a name '' and `` Make sure your PTR and A records match '' .

Nature 's services is a term for the ways in which nature benefits humans . It means particularly those benefits that can be measured in economic terms . Robert Costanza and other theorists of natural capital analyzed nature 's services to humanity in the 1990s . The economic contribution of seventeen of these services they caculated to be about US$ 33 trillion per year , greater than the activities the whole human economy , which was about US$ 25 trillion . This was based on estimated costs of replacing the services nature provides . For that purpose they were compared with equivalent services that are produced by humans . This calculation makes clear that mankind can not develop without nature 's services . This study is central for the theory of natural capital . But this study had no great influence on government policy or on WTO , IMF or G8 economic and trade policy .

Many artists who won the Prix de Rome are now almost forgotten . On the other hand , there are many artists who became very famous but did not win the Prix de Rome . These people include EugÃ ne Delacroix , Edouard Manet , Edgar Degas and the composers Ernest Chausson and Maurice Ravel . Ravel tried five times to win it .

All men benefit from this . Brownmiller also participated in civil rights activism . She joined CORE during the sit-in movement and volunteered for Freedom Summer in 1964 . She first became involved in the Women 's Liberation Movement in New York City in 1968 . There she joined a consciousness-raising group in the newly-formed New York Radical Women organization .

Particles which go near the speed of light are called ultrarelativistic . The ultrarelativistic limit is the maximum velocity that a particle can move at . Albert Einstein found the equation for energy : E = mcÂ . This means that energy is equal to a certain amount of mass. . However , this is a simplified version of his equation . The longer version of his equation is E2 = m2c4 + p2c2 . ( Mathematically , if you ignore the p2c2 and take the square root of the equation , you get E = mc2 ) . p2c2 refers to the velocity of a particle multiplied by a very large number . Einstein then went on to show that a particle can never achieve the speed of light , because you get a divide by zero error from the equation for kinetic energy , . Look at the denominator ( bottom ) of the equation , . `` v '' refers to the velocity of the particle . If its velocity reaches the speed of light ( which is `` c '' in this equation ) , will equal one , and since that would leave one minus one in the denominator , there would be a divide by zero error . Particles which go below the speed of light ( all particles which have mass ) are called tardyons . Theoretical particles which go above the speed of light are called tachyons .

Mohs scale of mineral hardness is named after the scientist , Friedrich Mohs , who invented a scale of hardness based on the ability of one mineral to scratch another . Rocks are made up of one or more minerals . According to the scale , Talc is the softest : it can be scratched by all other materials . Gypsum is harder : it can scratch talc but not calcite , which is even harder . The hardness of a mineral is mainly controlled by the strength of the bonding between the atoms and partly by the size of the atoms . It is a measure of the resistance of the mineral to scratching . As it says in Mohs scale , the diamond is always at the most top of the scale , being the hardest mineral . There are ten minerals in Mohs scale , talc , gypsum , calcite , fluorite , apatite , orthoclase , quartz , topaz , corundum , and for last and the hardest , diamond . But since the Mohs scale was made long ago , it is not exactly correct - for example , many have found and reported minerals higher in hardness than the diamond . So the Mohs scale may not be most completely perfect , but it is still quite trustworthy . 2.5 Fingernail 2.5 â `` 3 Gold , Silver 3 Copper penny 4-4 .5 Platinum 4-5 Iron 5.5 Knife blade 6-7 Glass 6.5 Iron pyrite 7 + Hardened steel file

Postal codes in Germany , ( PLZ ) ( plural Postleitzahlen , have five numbers . The first two show the wide area , the three other show the postal district . The present system was introduced on 1 July 1993 . Before reunification , both the Federal Republic of Germany ( FRG ) and the German Democratic Republic ( DDR ) used four-digit codes . There was a temporary system after reunification . Between 1989 and 1993 postal codes in the west started with W , eg W-1000 Berlin 30 ( postal districts in western cities were separate from the postal code ) and those in the east with O ( for Ost ) , eg : O-1234 Berlin . Companies that posted a lot of letters , have their own postal codes , separate from those used for postal districts or PO Box number ranges . Postal regions do not always follow state borders . This is because sometimes it is easier to deliver mail to a place on the border from the other state . Some codes in this range are in Thuringia . This list is incomplete .

Mab is a closer moon to Uranus . It was found by Mark R. Showalter and Jack J. Lissauer in 2003 using the Hubble Space Telescope . It was named after Queen Mab , a fairy queen from English folklore who is mentioned in William Shakespeare 's play Romeo and Juliet . Because the moon is small and dark , it was not seen in the images taken by Voyager 2 during its Uranus flyby in 1986 . However , it is brighter than another moon , Perdita , which was discovered from Voyager 's photos in 1997 . This led scientists to look at the old photos again , and the moon was finally found in the images . If it is as dark as Puck , it is about 24 km in diameter . On the other hand , if it is brightly colored like the neighbouring moon Miranda , it would be even smaller than Cupid and comparable to the smallest farther moons . Mab is heavily perturbed . The actual source for perturbation is still unclear , but is probably one or more of the nearby orbiting moons . Following its discovery , Mab was given the designation S\/2003 U 1 . The moon is also designated Uranus XXVI .

Transduction is the process by which DNA is transferred from one bacterium to another by a virus . Joshua Lederberg and his graduate student Norton Zinder showed in 1952 that bacteriophages could transfer genetic information between bacteria in Salmonella . This process explained how bacteria of different species could gain resistance to the same antibiotic very quickly . Transduction also refers to the process whereby foreign DNA is introduced into another cell via a viral vector . This is a common tool used by molecular biologists to introduce a foreign gene into a host cell 's genome . When bacteriophages infect a bacterial cell , their normal mode of reproduction is to harness the replicational , transcriptional , and translation machinery of the host bacterial cell to make numerous complete viral particles , including the viral DNA or RNA and the protein coat . Errors in this process can result in the virus carrying over DNA from one bacterium to another .

In paleontology , a Lazarus taxon ( plural taxa ) is a taxon that disappears from one or more periods of the fossil record , only to appear again later . The term refers to the Gospel of John , in which Jesus is claimed to have raised Lazarus from the dead . Lazarus taxa occur either because of ( local ) extinction , later resupplied , or as a sampling artifact . The fossil record is imperfect ( only a very small fraction of organisms become fossilized ) and contains gaps not necessarily caused by extinction , particularly when the number of individuals in a taxon becomes very low . The concept was developed in palaeontology where , after a major extinction event , some groups reappear after millions of years . The usual explanation is that numbers were driven so low that their chance of fossilisation were extremely low . Then , gradually , their numbers revived . There are some well-known examples of it happening to present-day species .

Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock formed from mud . The mud is a mix of flakes of clay minerals and tiny fragments ( silt-sized particles ) of other minerals , especially quartz and calcite . The ratio of clay to other minerals is variable . Shale is characterized by breaks along thin laminae or parallel layering or bedding less than one centimeter in thickness , called `` fissility '' ( = ~ splitting ) . Mudstones , on the other hand , are similar in composition but do not show the fissility . Shales and mudrocks contain roughly 95 percent of the organic matter in all sedimentary rocks . However , this amounts to less than one percent by mass in an average shale . Black shales form in anoxic ( without oxygen ) conditions . They contain free carbon and iron sulfides such as pyrite . This produces the black colouration .

The scrotum is the bag that holds the testicles in male mammals . It is made of skin and muscle and is found between the penis and anus . It is often covered in pubic hair and becomes tight when the male is aroused . The function of the scrotum is to keep the testicles less warm than the rest of the body . Human testicles work best at 36.8 degrees Celsius ( 98 degrees Fahrenheit ) when normal body temperature is 37 degrees Celsius ( 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) . Higher temperatures than 36.8 degrees will damage the sperm inside the testicles . The temperature is controlled by moving the testicles closer to the abdomen when they are too cold , and away when too hot . This is done by muscles contracting or relaxing . This lifts and lowers the testicles inside the scrotum . They can also be lifted by tightening the anus and pelvic muscles . The best temperature varies between species , but usually it 's a bit cooler than body temperature . This means that the testicles always have to be held outside of the body . Another explanation is to protect the testes from jolts and being crushed inside the body . Animals that have slow movements - such as elephants , whales , and moles - have internal testes and no scrotum .

Stromatolites are special rock-like structures . They usually form in shallow water . They are formed by bacteria such as cyanobacteria ( commonly known as blue-green algae ) . There may also be other types of bacteria and single-celled algae . The mucus secreted by the bacteria collects grains of sediment , and they are stuck together with calcium carbonate , also from the bacteria . This builds up into the structures seen in certain sea-shore bays . Cyanobacteria use water , carbon dioxide , and sunlight to create their food , and put out oxygen as a by-product . The real significance of stromatolites is that they are the earliest fossil evidence of life on Earth . The oldest stromatolites are dated to 3,450 million years ago , during the Archaean eon . Early cyanobacteria in stromatolites are thought to be largely responsible for increasing the amount of oxygen in the primaeval Earth 's atmosphere through their continuing photosynthesis .

Bookworm is a popular generalization for any insect which supposedly bores through books . This behavior is uncommon . Both the larvae of the death watch beetle ( Xestobium rufovillosum ) and the common furniture beetle ( Anobium punctatum ) will tunnel through wood and if paper is nearby they will pass into that . A major book-feeding insect is the booklouse ( or book louse ) . A tiny ( under 1 mm ) , soft-bodied wingless psocoptera ( usually Trogium pulsatorium ) . The insect actually feeds on molds and other organic matter found in ill-maintained works , but they will also attack bindings and other parts . It is also not a true louse . Many other insects , like the silverfish ( Lepisma saccharina ) or cockroach ( various Blattodea ) , will consume these molds , including degraded paper or the starch-based binding pastes â `` warmth and moisture or high humidity are needed , so damage is more common in the tropics . Modern glues and paper are less attractive to insects . Tineola bisselliella and Hofmannophila pseudospretella will attack cloth bindings .

In modern cryptography , symmetric key ciphers are generally divided into stream ciphers and block ciphers . Block ciphers operate on a fixed length string of bits . The length of this bit string is the block size . Both the input ( plaintext ) and output ( ciphertext ) are the same length ; the output can not be shorter than the input -- this is logically required by the Pigeonhole principle and the fact that the cipher must be invertible -- and it is simply undesirable for the output to be longer than the input . The DES is using a block size of 64 bits ( 8 bytes ) while the AES is using a block size of 128 bits ( 16 bytes ) . Rijndael , supports block sizes of 128 , 192 , and 256 bits , although the extra block sizes were not adopted by the AES standard . A few block ciphers , such as RC5 , support a variable block size . The Luby-Rackoff construction and the Outerbridge construction can both increase the effective block size of a cipher . Few ciphers have unusual block sizes , for example the 3-Way block cipher have an unusual block size of 96 bits ( 12 bytes ) .

Viridiplantae ( ` green plants ' ) are the clade which includes the green algae and land plants . In some classification systems they have been called Plantae , by expanding the traditional Plant Kingdom to include the green algae . Adl et al . , who produced a classification for all eukaryotes in 2005 , introduced the name Chloroplastida for this group , reflecting the group having primary chloroplasts with green chlorophyll . They rejected the name Viridiplantae on the grounds that most of the species are not plants , as understood traditionally . The monophyletic Chlorophyta and Charophyceae are classified under Viridiplantae . So , a simple arrangement is : ` Green algae ' is not used here because they are definitely not monophyletic . It is just a convenience term . There are more than 350,000 species of Viridiplantae .

The Luriaâ `` DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck experiment , 1943 , asks the question : are mutations independent of natural selection ? Or are they directed by the selection ? Max DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck and Salvador Luria showed that in bacteria , DNA mutations arise randomly . This means they happen at any time , rather than being a response to selection . So , Darwin 's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to more complex organisms . DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck and Luria won the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine partly for this work . In their experiment , Luria and DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck grew bacteria in tubes . After a period of growth , they put equal volumes of these separate cultures onto agar containing phage ( virus ) . If virus resistance were not due to random gene mutations , then each plate should contain roughly the same number of resistant colonies . This , however was not what DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck and Luria found . Instead , the number of resistant colonies on each plate varied drastically . Luria and DelbrÃ 1\/4 ck proposed that these results could be explained by the occurrence of a constant rate of random mutations in each generation of bacteria growing in the initial culture tubes .

Different people have tried to classify countries into different groups . This is usually done either by looking at how rich people are , on average in different countries , or how well-developed the political system is . Most of the time , there are two groups , namely developing countries and developed ones . Sometimes there are three groups . The third group is usually called emerging countries , and is between developing and developed countries . These definitions are problematic , because a high standard of living does n't just mean that people make a lot of money . The main problem is that things cost different amounts in different countries . Just because people earn more money in one country does not necessarily mean they are better-off ; they might earn more simply because the cost of living is higher . This means they need to spend more money just to buy those things they need every day . For this reason , there are different definitions of developing countries . The level of development also changes a lot from one developing countries to another . There are developing countries that have a high standard of living .

The term underweight refers to humans that have much less weight than they should . Being underweight is bad for the overall health of the person affected . It is normal what a person 's weights changes over time . Being underweight is often defined using a measure called the body mass index which calculates a score , based on height and weight . If this score is below 18.5 , a person is generally said to be underweight . This is only a general indication , though as the scores must not be calculated for everyone . It does not apply to children and adolescents , for example . There are problems that are related to being underweight . Very often being underweight is not the first problem . Rather , it often is the effect of another condition or disease . Unexpected weight loss requires the attention of a doctor . There might be another disease . If that disease is treated , the weight problem also disappears . Another problem underweight people face is that the weight problem affects their health : Their immune system is weakened , and they may get sick more often . People who are underweight because they can not get or afford the right food need special attention . Women who are underweight may not have their menstruation and face difficult pregnancies .

The insect family Mantophasmatidae is the sole family in its order . It is a group of African carnivorous insects discovered in 2002 . The most common vernacular name for this order is gladiators , but it is not well known under any name . Their modern center of endemism is western South Africa and Namibia , although a relict population and Eocene fossils suggest a wider ancient distribution . Members of the order are wingless even as adults , making them relatively difficult to identify . They resemble a mix between praying mantids and phasmids . Molecular evidence indicates that they are most closely related to a family known as the Grylloblattidae . The mantophasmids were originally described from old museum specimens that found in Namibia ( Mantophasma zephyrum ) and Tanzania ( M. subsolanum ) , and from a 45-million-year-old specimen of Baltic amber ( Raptophasma kerneggeri ) . The most recent classification recognizes numerous genera , including fossils .
Lepisma saccharina ( commonly called the fishmoth , urban silverfish or just the silverfish ) is a small , wingless insect . Typically it is between half an inch and one inch ( 12 â `` 25 mm ) .

In context with theater and movies a scenario ( from Italian , that which is pinned to the scenery ) is a description of an event or series of actions and events . In the Commedia dell ` arte it was an outline of entrances , exits , and action describing the story of a play that was literally pinned to the back of the scenery . Surviving scenari from the Renaissance contain little other than character names , brief descriptions of action , and references to specific lazzi with no further explanation . It is believed that a scenario forms the basis of a fully improvisational performance though it is also likely that they were simple reminders of the plot for those members of the cast who were literate . In the creation of an opera or ballet , a scenario is often developed initially to indicate how the original source , if any , is to be adapted . This sketch can be helpful in `` pitching '' the idea to a prospective producer , director , or composer . In policy planning and , generally , when organizations wish to test strategies against uncertain future developments , a scenario is also an account or synopsis of a projected course of action , events or situations . Scenarios are widely used by organizations of all types to understand different ways that future events might unfold .

Copper ( I ) iodide , also known as cuprous iodide , is a chemical compound . Its chemical formula is CuI . It has copper and iodide ions in it . The copper is in its +1 oxidation state . Copper ( I ) iodide is a white solid . It does not dissolve in water . It easily turns tan or brown . It is a reducing agent . The iodide easily oxidizes to iodine . Copper does not form a stable copper ( II ) iodide ; copper ( II ) iodide breaks down right away to make copper ( I ) iodide and iodine . It dissolves in concentrated iodides like potassium iodide . When it is diluted , it makes copper ( I ) iodide again . It can be made by reacting iodine and copper in concentrated hydroiodic acid . Another way would be to react copper ( II ) sulfate and potassium iodide . This makes copper ( II ) iodide which as said before breaks down right away to make iodine and copper ( I ) iodide . It is used to make organic compounds . It is also used to make clouds rain . It is used to make nylon resistant to heat . It can be used to put iodine to foods .

Therizinosaurus was a huge herbivorous theropod dinosaur from the end of the Cretaceous period . New , well-preserved finds such as Alxasaurus in 1993 and Beipiaosaurus in 1996 provided details about the bird-like pelvis , feet and skulls of primitive members . This helped confirm they belonged to the same group of theropod dinosaurs as Therizinosaurus and that therizinosaurs were , more specifically , advanced , herbivorous maniraptoran theropods . Their fossils were first found in the late 1940s in Asia . They were named in 1954 after more bones were found . It was a thought to be a carnivore and herbivore ; it had very long claws - they were about 3 ft long . The feeding habits of Therizinosaurus are unknown , since no skull material has ever been found that could indicate its diet . However , like other therizinosaurs , it was probably primarily herbivorous . There are multiple possible functions that could have been served by the claws of Therizinosaurus , such as defense against predators ( e.g. the contemporary Tarbosaurus ) and in intraspecific fighting , such as fighting for territory or for mating , or to pull leafy tree branches towards its mouth . The claws may have served all these functions .

Mosaic evolution ( or modular evolution ) is the idea that evolutionary change takes place in some body parts or systems without simultaneous changes in other parts . Another definition is the `` evolution of characters at various rates both within and between species '' .408 Its place in evolutionary theory comes under long-term trends or macroevolution . By its very nature , the evidence for this idea comes mainly from palaeontology . It is not claimed that this pattern is universal , but there are now a wide range of examples from many different taxa . Some examples : It has long been known that changes in the genes which control development cause changes in the final adult animal . Recent work shows how master control systems in development ( ` homeoboxes ' ) can organise selective changes in different parts of an organism . This is what underlies mosaic evolution .

Task parallelism ( also known as Thread level parallelism , function parallelism and control parallelism ) is a form of parallel computing for multiple processors using a technique for distributing execution of processes and threads across different parallel processor nodes . It contrasts to data parallelism as another form of parallelism . In a multiprocessor system , task parallelism is achieved when each processor executes a different thread ( or process ) on the same or different data . The threads may execute the same or different code . Different execution threads communicate with one another usually to pass data as they work . As a simple example , if we are running code on a 2-processor system ( CPUs `` a '' & `` b '' ) in a parallel computing environment and we want to do tasks `` A '' and `` B '' , it is possible to tell CPU `` a '' to do task `` A '' and CPU `` b '' to do task ` B '' simultaneously ( at the same time ) , in order to reduce the runtime of the execution . Task parallelism is used by multi-user and multitasking operating systems , and applications depending on processes and threads , unlike data processing applications ( see data parallelism ) . Most real programs use a combination of Task parallelism and Data parallelism .

An object in grammar is the target of an action , and occurs in any sentence with a transitive verb . It is an element in the clause which follows the verb , as in : The cat sat on the mat . She hit him . These are direct objects . The following are indirect objects : The dog brought Jane his lead . I sent my son a letter . The structure of these sentences is ( S\/V\/O \/ O ) where S = subject , V = verb and O = object . The first object is an indirect object , the second is a direct object . Notice that , in the last example , you sent a letter , not your son . The sentence makes perfect sense without the indirect object . I sent a letter to my son . Here some grammarians also see son as the indirect object ( letter is the term which can not be left out ) . p720

A Viral culture is a laboratory test in which the virus samples are placed with a cell medium that the virus being tested for is able to infect . If the cells show changes , known as cytopathic effects , then a culture is positive , meaning the test indicates infection . The older way of viral culture has been replaced by shell vial culture , in which the sample is spun onto a single layer of cells and viral growth is measured by antigen detection ways . This shortens the time to detection for slow growing viruses such as cytomegalovirus , for which the method was developed .

In anatomy , the term ligament mostly means fibrous tissue that connects bones to other bones . They are sometimes called `` articular ligaments '' , `` fibrous ligaments '' , or `` true ligaments '' . In this most common use , a ligament is a short band of tough fibrous connective tissue composed mainly of long , stringy collagen fibers . Ligaments connect bones to other bones to form a joint . ( They do not connect muscles to bones ; that is the function of tendons . ) Some ligaments limit the mobility of articulations , or prevent certain movements altogether . Ligaments are only slightly elastic ; when under tension , they gradually lengthen . This is one reason why dislocated joints must be set as quickly as possible : if the ligaments lengthen too much , then the joint will be weakened . Athletes , gymnasts , dancers , and martial artists perform stretching exercises to lengthen their ligaments , making their joints more supple . The consequence of a broken ligament can be instability of the joint . Not all broken ligaments need surgery , but if surgery is needed to stabilise the joint , the broken ligament can be joined .

The map lichen is a species of lichen , Rhizocarpon geographicum . It grows on rocks in areas of low air pollution . Each lichen is a flat patch bordered by a black line of spores . These patches grow next to each other . This makes the lichen look like a map or a patchwork field . Map lichen is a lichen widely used by climatologists to determine the relative age of deposits . As an example , they might use it in a moraine systems , to tell how long a rock has been exposed . With this they can also tell about glacial advances . The process is called lichenometry . Lichenometry is based on the assumption that the largest lichen growing on a rock is the oldest individual . If the growth rate is known , the maximum lichen size will give a minimum age for when this rock was deposited . Growth rates for different areas and species can be obtained by measuring maximum lichen sizes on substrates of known age , such as gravestones , historic or prehistoric rock buildings , or moraines of known age ( e.g those deposited during the Little Ice Age ) .

The Black bread mold , Rhizopus , is a common type of fungus . It grows and reproduces the same way that most moulds do . In asexual reproduction , the mould makes spores inside a sporangium . When the spores are ready to leave and spread more mold , the sporangium breaks open and lets the spores float out . In sexual reproduction its hyphae touch the hyphae of another Rhizopus mycelium . When they fuse , they make round balls called zygospores . After some time , the zygospore makes another sporangium , which then makes spores . During this sexual process , genetic recombination takes place , as with all eukaryotes . The spores land on a place where they can turn into a new mould , and begin to grow . They very quickly start making hyphae , small tendrils that look like roots . Hyphae are not roots , but part of the mycelium . The mycelium is the main part of the mould , and grows inside the bread . Black bread mould grows fast when the temperature is higher than 15 degrees Celsius and lower than 20oC . Black bread mould is found in all countries of the world . It is often found growing on bread and on soft fruits such as bananas and grapes . Because the mould spores are airborne , the mould can spread easily .

Dark energy is the name given to the force that is believed to be making the universe get bigger . Distant galaxies appear to be moving away from us at high speed : the idea is that the universe is getting bigger and has been since the Big Bang . Measurements are now good enough to allow astronomers to tell that these galaxies seem to be accelerating away from us . The universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate . This faster and faster expansion is not understood . There are many ideas for what might be causing it , but at the moment we do not know enough to say whether any of them are right . It can be said that it is as if there was something there in empty space providing a repulsive force that makes the universe expand . This has been named dark energy .

The first inhabitants of the Archipelago arrived around 33,000 years ago after sailing from what is now Papua New Guinea . Later arrivals included the Lapita people . The first European to visit these islands was Dutch explorer Willem Schouten in 1616 . The islands remained unsettled by western Europeans until they became part of the German protectorate of German New Guinea in 1884 . The area was named in honor of the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck . On 13 March 1888 , a volcano erupted on Ritter Island causing a megatsunami .

Caid was the name given to several ancient and traditional Irish football games . `` Caid '' is now used by some people for modern Gaelic football . The word caid originally meant the ball which was used . It was made out of animal skin , with a natural bladder inside . Some people believe that caid has influenced the modern sport of Gaelic football the rules of which were officially published in 1887 . The first recorded mention of football in Ireland was in 1308 , when John McCrocan , a spectator at a football game was charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard . Football games are mentioned in the Statute of Galway , 1527 , which allowed the playing of football and archery , but banned `` hokie '' -- the hurling of a little ball with sticks or staves , as well as other sports . Caid was especially popular in rural areas . There is some evidence that caid was taken around the world by the Irish diaspora , and that it may have influenced the development of Australian rules football , although this is controversial . By the late 19th century , caid , like many aspects of native Irish culture , was in steep decline .

In Greek mythology , Pandora 's box was a large jar ( Ï Î Î Î Ï pithos ) carried by Pandora . It contained the evils to be let loose on mankind . When the box was empty , hope remained . The actual evils are not specified by Hesiod . The word used in the original text is pithos , which usually refers to a large container ; used to store wine or other things . Such containers were also used for funerals . In the case of Pandora , this jar may have been made of clay for use as storage as in the usual sense , or , instead , of bronze metal as an unbreakable prison . The mistranslation of pithos as `` box '' is usually attributed to the 16th century humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam . Erasums is thought to have made the error when he translated Hesiod 's tale of Pandora into Latin . Hesiod 's pithos refers to a storage jar for oil or grain . Erasmus , however , translated pithos into the Latin word pyxis , meaning `` box '' . The phrase `` Pandora 's box '' has endured ever since . This error was further backed by Dante Gabriel Rossetti 's painting Pandora .
When talking about chemical solutions , the term supersaturated means that a solution contains more of a substance , that could be solved in it . Carbonated water is a supersaturated solution of carbon dioxide gas in water . At the start , the pressure in the bottle is very high . This means that more Carbon dioxide gas can be put into the water than at normal pressure . When the bottle is opened , the pressure falls to the normal level , and the carbon dioxide gas escapes very slowly . Certain things such as small bubbles in the bottle can make this process faster . Such bubbles can be caused by shaking the bottle . Another solute , such as sugar powder or a widget . A Diet Coke and Mentos eruption is a more extreme example . Some drinks such as ales and stouts e.g. Guinness rely on this effect to produce the ` head ' on the surface of the poured product .

In chemistry , a silicate is a compound consisting of one or more central silicon atoms that are surrounded by electronegative ligands . The most common silicate species consist of silicon with oxygen as the ligand . Silicate anions , with a negative net electrical charge , must have that charge balanced by other cations to make an electrically neutral compound . In geology and astronomy , the term silicate is used to denote types of rock that consist predominantly of silicate minerals . On Earth , a wide variety of silicate minerals occur in an even wider range of combinations as a result of the processes that form and re-work the crust . These processes include partial melting , crystallization , fractionation , metamorphism , weathering and diagenesis . Living things also contribute to the silicate cycle near the Earth 's surface . A type of plankton known as diatoms construct their exoskeletons , known as tests , from silica . The tests of dead diatoms are a major constituent of deep ocean sediment

There are two of these ducts . They are muscular tubes ( surrounded by smooth muscle ) . They connect the left and right epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts in order to move sperm . Each tube is about 30 centimeters long . During ejaculation the smooth muscle in the wall of the vas deferens contracts , That pushes the sperm toward the penis . The sperm go from the vas deferens into the urethra . Other male sex glands push out at the same time . There is a surgery called vasectomy that is a method of contraception . The two vasa deferentia ( Latin plural ) are cut and sealed , so the sperm can not get out of the body . This is usually permanent , but in sometimes it can be reversed .

A Salt evaporation pond ( or saltern pond ) is a man-made shallow pond . Usually it is located near the sea . The ponds can be filled with salt water . The water is then left to evaporate . The salt is left behind , and can be harvested . Such ponds also provide a habitat for several kinds of animals . Most of these animals are birds . The color tells how much salt there is left in the water . Green colors come from special algae . These algae are there in low to mid salinity ponds ( ponds with little salt in the water ) . In middle to high salinity ponds , an alga called Dunaliella salina shifts the color to red . Millions of tiny brine shrimp create an orange cast in mid-salinity ponds . Other bacteria such as Stichococcus also contribute tints . These colors are especially interesting to airplane passengers or astronauts passing above due to their somewhat artistic formations of shape and color .

In the study of orbital dynamics the mean anomaly of an orbiting body is the angle the body would have traveled about the center of the orbit 's auxiliary circle . Unlike other measures of anomaly , the mean anomaly grows linearly with time . Because of the linear growth with time , the mean anomaly makes calculating the time of flight between two points on the orbit very easy . The mean anomalies for the two points are calculated and their difference is found . Knowing this , the ratio of this difference relative to the entire encompassing one orbit is simply equal to ratio of the time of flight to the orbital period of one whole orbit ( i.e. ) .

The combined stream runs southwest for approximately 45 miles and joins Indus River at Mithankot . The Indus continues into the Arabian Sea . A dam on Panjnad has been erected ; it provides irrigation channels for Punjab and Sind provinces south of the Sutlej and east of the Indus rivers . Beyond the confluence of Indus and Panjnad rivers , the Indus river was known as Satnad ( Sat = seven ) carrying the waters of seven rivers including Indus river , which is believed to be in ealrlier times the Saraswati River\/Ghaggar-Hakra River river which eventually dried and became a seasonal river due to seismic shifts in the glacial region of Himachal Pradesh where it originated and later on Kabul river and the five rivers of Punjab .
Potassium iodate is a chemical compound . Its chemical formula is KIO3 . It has potassium and iodate ions in it . Potassium iodate is a white solid . It is a strong oxidizing agent . It is similar to potassium bromate and potassium chlorate . It reacts violently with many reducing agents . Potassium iodate is made by reacting iodic acid with potassium hydroxide or by reacting iodine with potassium hydroxide . This second reaction makes the iodide and the iodate . Potassium iodate is used to add iodine to salt . It is better than potassium iodide because it does not oxidize to iodine and evaporate like potassium iodide does . It is sometimes used in flour just like potassium bromate . It is also used for radiation protection . A nuclear explosion can make radioactive iodine , which goes into the thyroid and can make cancer . Eating potassium iodate makes the thyroid full of nonradioactive iodine and prevents radioactive iodine from going in . It lasts longer than potassium iodide .

The Epistle to the Romans or Letter to the Romans , is one of the letters written by Apostle Paul to a church elsewhere . Here , the letter is addressed to the early Church in Rome . Paul wrote the letter to the Romans to explain a very important point in Christianity . He proves , by quoting the Old Testament , that all humankind is guilty of sin before God . People whom God calls righteous can only do so by trusting in God 's ways , and not by their own effort . Only by believing in Jesus , who is the Christ and who died for humanity for their sins , can people be saved . Once this belief is had , the believer receives the Holy Spirit , who helps the believer live a new life . Paul asks the Romans to observe Christian ethics and submit themselves to authorities . The letter remains very influential in explaining to non-Christians and new Christians what their Christian belief is all about .

The Presentation of the Rose scene in Act Two of Richard Strauss 's opera Der Rosenkavalier is written in F-sharp major . F-sharp major is the key of Beethoven 's Piano Sonata , Op . 78 , of Chopin 's Barcarolle , of Liszt 's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 , of Mahler 's unfinished Tenth Symphony , Erich Korngold 's Symphony Op . 40 , and Scriabin 's Fourth Sonata . In a few scores , the F-sharp major key signature in the bass clef is written with the sharp for the A on the top line .

Ophthalmosaurus was an ichthyosaur of the Upper Jurassic period ( 165 to 150 million years ago ) , named after its large eyes . Well-preserved skeletons , ranging in age from juveniles to adults , have been found in Europe , North America and Argentina . Ophthalmosaurus had the largest eyes of any vertebrate relative to its body size . Its eyes , 4 inches in diameter , occupied most of the space in the skull . They were protected by bony plates ( sclerotic rings ) , which most likely assisted to maintain the shape of the eyeballs against water pressure at depth . The size of the eyes and the sclerotic rings suggests that Ophthalmosaurus hunted at a depth where there is not much light or that it may have hunted at night when a prey species was more active . Its snout was long and thin , perfect for snapping at fast , manoeuverable , prey . Calculations suggest that a typical Ophthalmosaurus could stay submerged for approximately 20 minutes or more . The swimming speed of Ophthalmosaurus has been estimated at 2.5 metres per second or greater . Even assuming a conservative speed of 1 m\/s , an Ophthalmosaurus would be able to dive to 600 meters and return to the surface within 20 minutes . The family Ophthalmosauridae continued into the Upper Cretaceous , but this genus became extinct at the end of the Jurassic period .

The ossicles are the three smallest bones in the human body . They may be called ear bones or auditory ossicles . They occur in all mammals . They are contained within the middle ear space and serve to transmit sounds from the air to the fluid-filled labyrinth ( cochlea ) . The absence of the auditory ossicles would constitute a moderate-to-severe hearing loss . The ossicles are , in order from the eardrum to the inner ear ( from superficial to deep ) , the malleus , incus , and stapes . The terms mean hammer , anvil , and stirrup . Studies have shown that ear bones in mammal embryos are attached to the dentary , which is part of the lower jaw . These are ossified ( turned into bone ) portions of cartilage -- called Meckel 's cartilage -- that are attached to the jaw . As the embryo develops , the cartilage hardens to form bone . Later in development , the bone structure breaks loose from the jaw and migrates to the inner ear area . The structure is known as the middle ear , and is made up of the incus , stapes , malleus , and tympanic membrane . These correspond to the quadrate , prearticular , articular , and angular structures in earlier land vertebrates .

Vetus Latina is the name given to a collection of Biblical texts that were translated into Latin before the Vulgate became the standard version used in the Latin-speaking world . The texts themselves are written in Late Latin , not in Old Latin . They often use different words than the Vulgate . No complete manuscript survives , only fragments are known . Many text passages are known because Church fathers such as Augustine of Hippo cited from them . Since the Council of Trent , held in the 16th century , the Vulgate is the official Bible translation for the Roman Catholic Church . The Old Latin text means , `` Glory ( belongs ) to God among the high , and peace ( belongs ) to men of good will on earth '' .

Probably the best known difference between the Old Latin and the Vulgate is in the Pater Noster , where the phrase from the Vetus Latina , quotidianum panem , `` daily bread '' , becomes supersubstantialem panem , `` supersubstantial bread '' in the Vulgate .

Iguanodon is a genus of ornithopod dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous period in Europe , North America , Africa and Asia . It lived 125\/126 million years ago . Discovered in 1822 and described three years later by English geologist Gideon Mantell , Iguanodon was the second dinosaur formally named , after Megalosaurus . Together with Megalosaurus and Hylaeosaurus , it was one of the three genera originally used to define Dinosauria . A large , bulky herbivore , Iguanodon is in the same family as the duck-billed hadrosaurs . The taxonomy of the genus continues to be a topic of study as new species are named or long-standing ones reassigned to other genera . Scientific understanding of Iguanodon has evolved over time as new information has been obtained from the fossils . The numerous specimens of this genus , including nearly complete skeletons from two well-known bonebeds , have allowed researchers to make informed hypotheses regarding many aspects of the living animal , including feeding , movement , and social behavior . As one of the first scientifically well-known dinosaurs , Iguanodon has occupied a small but notable place in the public 's perception of dinosaurs , its artistic representation changing significantly in response to new interpretations of its remains .

490 Veritas is a big asteroid , which may have been involved in one of the more huge asteroid-asteroid collisions of the past 100 million years . At 115 and 125 km in diameter , Veritas and 92 Undina are the biggest of the 300-strong Veritas family of asteroids . David NesvornÃ 1\/2 of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder traced the orbits of these bodies back in time , and calculated that they formed in a collision of a body at least 150 km in diameter with a smaller asteroid some 8 million years ago . Veritas and Undina would have been the biggest pieces of that collision . The thought Veritas collision would have been too far from Jupiter for the pieces to have been slung into a collision course with Earth . However , solar radiation would have caused the resulting dust to drift inward to Earth orbit over a time span consistent with the record of dust in the ocean sediment . Today continuing collisions among Veritas-family asteroids are estimated to send five thousand tons of cosmic dust to Earth each year , 15 % of the total . It was found by Max Wolf in 1902 . Its provisional name was 1902 JP .

The ` somatosensory system ' is a sensory system that detects experiences labeled as touch or pressure , temperature ( warm or cold ) , pain ( including itch and tickle ) and those that belong to proprioception . These are the sensations of muscle movement and joint position including posture , movement , visceral ( internal ) senses and facial expression . Visceral senses have to do with sensory information from within the body , such as stomach aches . Touch may be considered one of five human senses ; however , when a person touches something or somebody this gives rise to various feelings : the perception of pressure ( shape , softness , texture , vibration , etc. ) , relative temperature and sometimes pain . Thus the term `` touch '' is actually the combined term for several senses . In medicine , the colloquial term `` touch '' is usually replaced with somatic senses , to better reflect the variety of mechanisms involved .

A mebibyte is a unit of measure . It represents 1024 \* 1024 bytes . A mebibyte ( a contraction of mega binary byte ) is a unit of information or computer storage , abbreviated MiB . The mebibyte is closely related to the megabyte ( MB ) . This can either be a synonym for mebibyte , or refer to 106 bytes = 1,000,000 bytes , depending on context ( see binary prefix for background ) . The two numbers are relatively close together , but mistaking the two has nevertheless occasionally led to problems . The unit was defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission ( IEC ) in December 1998 . Use of mebibyte and related units is strongly endorsed by IEEE and CIPM and is slowly becoming more common . One mebibyte equals 1024 ( = 210 ) kibibytes , and 1024 mebibytes equal one gibibyte . Mibibyte is a common misspelling , presumably from the `` i '' in the abbreviation or confusion about how the surrounding prefixes ( i.e. `` kibi '' and `` gibi '' ) were actually formed . The `` i '' is actually from the end of the prefix . Tebi - and pebi - are similarly abbreviated Ti - and Pi - , but they are not usually misspelled , as storage sizes ( and corresponding terms ) currently are only this large in specialized situations .

is a utility which superimposes one image over another , and positions it relative to the top left corner of the bottom image . Although the original idea was to place a dot on a locator map based on editable coordinates , it can be used to precisely overlay any two images for any reason . To get started , you can simply copy this blank definition into your page , and fill in the data . I originally built this template thinking I could use an SVG file with transparency ( mostly for the dot in locator maps ) . However , it seems Internet Explorer users ca n't handle transparent PNGs without a fix that Wikimedia 's not yet delivering , so for now I recommend using the GIF version in the example above . When IE better supports PNGs , we can swap the better format back in . -- Papayoung 02:06 , 26 October 2005 ( UTC )

C major ( or C-sharp major ) is a major scale based on C. Its key signature has seven sharps . Its relative minor is ( ( A-sharp minor A minor ) ) , and its parallel minor is ( ( C-sharp minor C minor ) ) . Its enharmonic equivalent is ( ( D-flat major D major ) ) . When a harp is tuned to C-sharp major , it has all its pedals in the bottom position . Because all the strings are made shorter in this way , it makes it less resonant . Most composers prefer to use the enharmonic equivalent D-flat major because it has just five flats . However , Johann Sebastian Bach actually chose C-sharp major for Prelude and Fugue No. 3 in both books of the Well-Tempered Clavier . In Hungarian Rhapsody No. 6 , Franz Liszt changes key from D-flat major to C-sharp major near the beginning of the piece . Maurice Ravel used C-sharp major as the tonic key of Ondine from his piano suite Gaspard de la nuit . Louis Vierne used C-sharp major in the final piece of Messe solennelle .

Pietro Cavallini , ( c. 1250 â `` c. 1330 ) was a painter who lived and worked in Rome in Italy in the Late Medieval period . He may have also worked in Naples . He is thought of as one of the greatest painters of his day , but has never been as well-known as Giotto from Florence , who was alive at the same time . This is probably because only two pictures by Cavallini still exist . One of them is a mosaic in the Church of Santa Maria in Trastevere . The other is a fresco in the nearby convent of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere . ( `` in Trastevere '' means `` in the part of the Rome that is across the Tiber River '' . ) The fresco at Santa Cecilia 's is a large picture of the Last Judgement with Jesus sitting between rows of saints . ( see right ) Unfortunately , the room , which was quite tall , had a new level added , and the floor cut across the fresco . It is in ruins , but the parts that remain show that Cavallini was trying to make the figures that he painted look solid and three-dimensional like the frescos of Ancient Rome . Pietro Cavallini probably influenced the artists who traveled from Rome to work at the Basilica of St Francis of Assisi . It is not known if he painted any of the frescos there .

The Himalia group is a group of prograde non-spherical moons of Jupiter that follow similar orbits to Himalia and are thought to have a common origin . The orbit estimate of the recently found moon S\/2000 J 11 also qualified it as a member of the group ( it appeared to have the same inclination , and a slightly bigger semi-major axis ) but its orbit is not known exactly and the mean orbital elements have not yet been calculated . The International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) reserves names in - a for the moons in this group . The objects in the Himalia group have semi-major axes ( distances from Jupiter ) in the range of 11,150,000 and 11,750,000 km , inclinations between 26.6 Â and 28.3 Â , and eccentricities of between 0.11 and 0.25 . All moons in the group are gray similar to C-type asteroids . It has been suggested that the group could be a remnant of the break-up of an asteroid from the main asteroid belt . The radius of the parent asteroid was probably about 89 km , only a bit bigger than that of Himalia , which retains approximately 87 % of the mass of the original body . This indicates the asteroid was not heavily disturbed .

In astronomy , reflection nebulae are clouds of dust which reflect light of a star or many stars . The light from the nearby star , or stars , is not hot enough to ionize the gas of the nebula to make an emission nebula , but is enough to make the dust visible because the light reflects off of the dust . Reflection nebulae are usually blue because the scattering works better for blue light than red ( this is the same reason that the sky is blue and sunsets are red ) . Reflection nebulae and emission nebulae are usually seen together and sometimes are called diffuse nebulae . A good example of this is the Orion Nebula . Reflection nebulae may also be the site of star formation .
The Perfect Fool is an opera in one act with music written by the English composer Gustav Holst . Holst wrote the work over the time period from 1918 to 1922 . The opera was first played at the Covent Garden Theatre , London on May 14 , 1923 . At the beginning , Holst had asked Clifford Bax to write the libretto , but Bax did not want to do so . In the musical score , Holst made fun of the musical works of Verdi , Wagner 's work Parsifal and Debussy . In the opera , the Fool 's part is only one word long . One popular way of thinking of the opera 's meaning is that the Princess symbolises the world of opera and the Fool is the British people . The opera did not do well , and audiences thought that the opera did not make any sense . Although the opera was given a live BBC broadcast a year after it was first played , it is not often played today .

In cryptography , a ciphertext-only attack ( COA ) or known ciphertext attack is an attack model for cryptanalysis where the attacker is assumed to have access only to a set of ciphertexts . The attack is completely successful if the corresponding plaintexts can be deduced ( extracted ) , or even better , the key . The ability to obtain any amount of information from the underlying ciphertext is considered a success . Every modern cipher attempts to provide protection against ciphertext-only attacks . The process of Selecting a new cipher design standard usually takes many years and includes exhaustive testing of large quantities of ciphertext for any statistical different approach from random noise . On the other hand poor cipher depends on home-grown proprietary algorithms that have not been subjected to extensive testing and inspection ; for this reason many computer-age encryption systems are still subject to ciphertext-only attack but still in use . Examples include :

`` Avalon '' is a popular song . It was written by Al Jolson , Buddy DeSylva and Vincent Rose in 1920 . It was first recorded by Jolson and used in the musicals Sinbad and Bombo . Jolson 's version became # 2 on the American singles chart . It is possible that Rose wrote the song alone , and that Jolson 's name was used in the credits because he was a popular artist and helped make the song popular . At first only Rose and Jolson were marked as the writers , and DeSylva 's name was added later . Many jazz artists have recorded the song , for example Cab Calloway ( 1934 ) , Coleman Hawkins ( 1935 ) and Eddie Durham ( 1936 ) . Benny Goodman played the song in his concert in Carnegie Hall in 1938 . The song was also played in the films The Jolson Story ( 1946 ) and The Benny Goodman Story ( 1956 ) . The melody at the beginning of the song was taken from Giacomo Puccini 's opera Tosca , and Rose changed it only a little . Because of this , a court later decided that Jolson and Rose had to pay Puccini 's publishers $ 25,000 and all later profits from the song .

Pedogenesis or soil evolution ( formation ) is the process by which soil is created . Climate regulates soil formation . Soils are more developed in areas with higher rainfall and more warmth . The rate of chemical weathering increases by 2-3 times when the temperature increases by 10 degrees Celsius ( 20 Â F ) . Climate also affects which organisms are present , affecting the soil chemically and physically ( movement of roots , burrowing by animals ) . The organisms living in and on the soil form distinct soil types . Coniferous forests have acidic leaf litter and form what are known as inceptisols . Mixed or deciduous forests leave a larger layer of humus , changing the elements leached and accumulated in the soil , forming alfisols . Prairies have very high humus accumulation , creating a dark , thick A horizon characteristic of mollisols . The rock from which soil is formed is called parent material . The main types are : eolian , glacial till , glacial outwash , alluvium , lacustrine parent material and residual parent material , or bedrock . Pedogenesis is the major topic of the science of pedology , whose other aspects include the soil morphology , classification ( taxonomy ) of soils , and their distribution in nature , present and past ( soil geography and paleopedology ) .

Silt is soil or rock that developed from granular material of a specific grain size . Silt particles range between a and mm ( 3.9 to 62.5 Î 1\/4 m ) , larger than clay but smaller than a sand . Silt is chemically distinct from clay , and unlike clay , grains of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions . Silt may occur as a soil or alternatively as suspended sediment in a water column of any surface water body . It may also exist as deposition soil at the bottom of a water body and it can occur as a deposit or as material transported by a stream or by a current in the ocean . Silt is easily transported in water and is fine enough to be carried long distances by air as ` dust ' . Thick deposits of silty material that result from wind deposition are often called loess ( a German term ) or limon ( French ) . Silt and clay contribute to turbidity in water .

A sensor is a device that measures a physical quantity and converts it into a signal which can be read by an observer or by an instrument . For example , a mercury thermometer converts the measured temperature into expansion and contraction of a liquid which can be read on a calibrated glass tube . There are a lot of different types of sensors . Sensors are used in everyday objects . A sensor that detects temperature . Thermal sensors are found in many laptops and computers in order to sound an alarm when a certain temperature has been exceeded . An electronic device used to measure a physical quantity such as pressure or loudness and convert it into an electronic signal of some kind ( e.g. a voltage ) . A motion sensor detects physical movement in a given area . Because of certain disadvantages of physical contact sensors , newer technology non-contact sensors have become prevalent in industry , performing well in many applications . The recent style of non-contact sensors shows that â Thin ( g ) is Inâ . Market trends show that form and size are important . Users are looking for smaller and more accurate sensors . New technologies for the sensing chips are breaking application barriers . For the future , the trend will be to continue to provide smaller , more affordable sensors that have the flexbility to fit even more applications in both industrial and commercial environments .

Metriacanthosaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in Europe during the Middle Jurassic period , about 160 million years ago . Its name means `` Moderate-spined lizard '' , because its back vertebrae are taller than other meat-eating dinosaurs such as Allosaurus , but shorter than those of other meat-eating dinosaurs , such as Acrocanthosaurus . Like most theropods , Metriacanthosaurus was a meat-eater . It had three fingers on each hand . Each finger ended in a sharp , hook-like claw that was used to grab prey before giving the killing bite with its jaws . It probably preyed on the large , long-necked sauropods , such as Pelorosaurus , that lived in the same time and place as it . It was originally classified as a megalosaurid , but recent studies show that it belongs to its own family , the Metriacanthosauridae In Jurassic Park , one of the vials of dinosaur DNA that Dennis Nedry steals is labeled Metriacanthosaurus . However , this may refer to either M. parkeri or Yangchuanosaurus shangyouensis , which Gregory S. Paul then classified as a species of Metriacanthosaurus .

Often , deletion discussions are closed by administrators . However , sometimes people who are not admins are allowed to close them instead . Administrators have the delete tool , so they are the only people who are allowed to close articles as `` delete '' . If the discussion is obviously a `` keep '' , then non-admins are allowed to close the discussion . Non-administrators should stay clear of anything too controversial . Like this , bureaucrats are the only people who can close requests for adminship and bot flags as successful , as they are the only users who can give users the flags . Non-crats are allowed to close requests for adminship as `` failed '' , as long as it is obvious , for example , if a nomination is eligible for speedy closure . Any editor in good standing is allowed to close check-usership and oversighter requests , as only stewards are able to promote users to those positions . They do not have to be administrators or bureaucrats .

Pakicetus is a genus of extinct cetaceans found in the early Eocene ( 55.8 Â 0.2 - 33.9 Â 0.1 Ma ) of Pakistan , hence their name . The strata where the fossils were found was then part of the coast of the Tethys Sea . The first fossil , a lone skull , was thought to be a mesonychid , but Gingerich and Russell recognized it as an early cetacean from characteristic features of the inner ear , found only in cetaceans : the large auditory bulla is formed from the ectotympanic bone only . This suggests that it is a transitional species between extinct land mammals and modern cetaceans . Complete skeletons were discovered in 2001 , revealing that Pakicetus was primarily a land animal , about the size of a wolf , and very similar in form to the related mesonychids .

Relationships are usually seen as evolutionary trees ( cladograms , phylogenetic trees , phylogenies ) . Phylogenies have two components , branching order ( showing group relationships ) and branch length ( showing amount of evolution ) . Phylogenetic trees of species and higher taxa are used to study the evolution of traits ( anatomical or molecular characteristics ) , and the distribution of organisms ( biogeography ) . Systematics is used to help us understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth . `` Systematic biology '' and `` taxonomy '' are terms that are often confused and used interchangeably . They were defined as follows : Systematics is the field which ( a ) provides scientific names for organisms , ( b ) describes them , ( c ) preserves collections of them , ( d ) provides classifications for the organisms , keys for their identification , and data on their distributions , ( e ) investigates their evolutionary histories , and ( f ) considers their environmental adaptations . Taxonomy is that part of systematics concerned with topics ( a ) to ( d ) above .

Some possibilities are : The Random House Dictionary says that : `` The term Canuck is first recorded about 1835 as an Americanism , originally referring specifically to a French Canadian . This was probably the original meaning , though in Canada and other countries , Canuck now more often refers to any Canadian . '' When `` Canuck '' is used by Canadians , the meaning is usually affectionate , friendly or patriotic . The use of `` Canuck '' is similar to the use of some other potentially offensive nicknames . When it is used by the people it names -- Canadians in this case -- it is usually acceptable . But when it is used by an outsider -- in this case particularly Americans -- it can be thought of as insulting one 's heritage . Although it is not as severe as most ethnic slurs , some consider it one - just as Yankee can be .

Close approaches of the object are not common : it has not come within one astronomical unit ( about 150 million km ) of a planet since 764 BC , and will not again until 5290 . Astronomers think that Pholus started out as a Kuiper belt object . It was found by David L. Rabinowitz , then of the University of Arizona 's Spacewatch Project , and named after Pholus , the brother of the mythological Chiron , after which 2060 Chiron was named to follow the tradition of naming this class of outer planet crossing objects after Centaurs . Pholus was the second Centaur type asteroid to be found and was quickly found to be very red in color . Because it 's very red , it is sometimes called `` Big Red '' .

Megalania ( Varanus prisca ) was a giant monitor lizard in southern Australia . It was part of a megafaunal assemblage that inhabited southern Australia during the Pleistocene , and appears to have disappeared around 40,000 years ago . The first aboriginal settlers of Australia may have encountered living Megalania . Megalania is the largest terrestrial lizard known to have existed . Judging from its size , Megalania would have fed mostly upon medium to large sized animals , including any of the giant marsupials like Diprotodon . Ralph Molnar in 2004 determined a range of potential sizes for Megalania ( made by scaling up from dorsal vertebrae , after he determined a relationship between dorsal vertebrae length and total body length ) . If it had a long thin tail like the Lace monitor ( Varanus varius ) , then it would have reached a length of 7.9 m , while if its tail-to-body proportions were more similar to that of the Komodo dragon , then a length of around 7 m is more likely . Taking the maximal 7 m length , he estimated a weight of 1940 k , with a leaner 320 k being average . This is twice the length of their closest living relative , the Komodo dragon of eastern Indonesia .
Emperor Nintoku was the 16th emperor of Japan , according to the traditional order of succession .

According to Nihon Shoki , Nintoku was the fourth son of Emperor Å jin and the father of three emperors â '' RichÅ `` , Hanzei , and IngyÅ . Very little is known about the events of Nintoku 's life and reign . Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch , Emperor Kimmei . Nintoku 's reign is marked by Japan 's first large-scale engineering projects . This emperor 's posthumous name must must have been regularized many centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Nintoku .

Nintoku is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ( misasagi ) which is associated with the burial mound .

The Liver birds are two large and famous bronze metal birds on top of a building - the Liver Building - in the city of Liverpool , England .

This is a funny play on words . There is also a British television sitcom with the same name that is about two women in Liverpool . The play on words is increased by a second British slang meaning of the word `` bird '' to mean a young woman . Many people in Liverpool ( they are known as Liverpudlians ) are proud of their city and of the Liver birds . There is a story that the birds will come alive if a truly pure woman walks between them . This will never happen ! This is an example of the humor of the local people .

The Lymington branch line is a short line running between Brockenhurst and Lymington Pier . The line is operated by South West Trains . There is a station in between called Lymington Town . The short length of track between Lymington Town and Lymington Pier has a line speed of 20mph . The two preserved 421cig units make the line a popluar destination for rail-fans . Unit 1497 `` Freshwater '' was painted in British Rail White and Blue while 1498 `` Farringford '' was painted in BR Green . The units were given names of places on the Isle of Wight as they only ran on this line . Until 22 May 22 2010 they were the only EMU slamdoor units still in operation anywhere in Britain . The line is now operated by 158\/9 sprinter units . This means the 750Volt DC electric has no longer got a use . This may seem strange as most parts of the country are electrifiying lines . The reason for this is that 450 units have 4 cars which are too long for Lymington Town Station . And South West Trains are not willing to remove a coach from a 450 unit . The only solution then is to use DMU 3 car sprinter units .

The triple point of water or any substance is the combination of temperature and pressure at which it exists in its solid , liquid , and gaseous state all at once , in equilibrium . The temperature of the triple point of water is a commonly used physical constant which is used to define temperature scales and calibrate temperature-measuring systems . By definition , the temperature of the triple point of water is 273.16 K , or 0.01 Â C. One degree Celsius is defined as 1\/273 .16 th part of the triple point of water . This fixes the temperature scale as defined in the ITS 90 , which is the international temperature scale of 1990 . This scale is developed as a practical approximation of the thermodynamical temperature scale .

An orchestra pit is the space where an orchestra plays in a theater or opera house . The actors or singers are on the stage , and the orchestra pit is normally lower than the stage so that the audience can watch the play or opera . Depending on where they sit , the audience may just be able to see the heads of the musicians in the orchestra pit . It is important that singers can see the conductor so that they can watch the beat out of the corner of their eye . Opera houses nowadays often have close-circuit television monitors at the sides so that singers can watch the conductor even when they are not facing him . The orchestra pit in the Bayreuth Festspielhaus is unusual . This opera house was designed by the composer Richard Wagner for the performance of his own operas . He did not want the audience to be able to see the orchestra at all , so it is very low . The orchestra members do not have to dress up in ties and jackets because they can not be seen anyway .

They lived from the middle Permian into the Triassic 265.0 â '' 245.0 million years ago , so existing for about 20 million years . The therocephalians are named after their large skulls , which , along with the structure of their teeth , suggest that they were successful carnivores . Like other non-mammalian therapsids , therocephalians are sometimes described as mammal-like reptiles . In fact Therocephalia is the group most closely related to the cynodonts , which gave rise to the mammals . This relationship shows in a variety of anatomical features , possibly including whiskers and hair . There remain many unanswered questions about the phylogeny , anatomy , and physiology of therocephalians . The fossils of therocephalians are numerous in the Karoo of South Africa , but have also been found in Russia , China , and Antarctica . Early therocephalian fossils discovered in Middle Permian deposits of South Africa support a Gondwanan origin for the group , which seems to have spread quickly throughout the world . Although almost every therocephalian lineage ended during the great Permianâ `` Triassic extinction event , a few representatives of the subgroup ( called Eutherocephalia ) survived into the early Triassic and continued to diversify . However , the last therocephalians became extinct by the early middle Triassic . The reasons are not known .

Terabytes hold 1000 gigabytes ( GB ) or a trillion ( 1,000,000,000,000 ) bytes , and 1000 terabytes make one petabyte . Some people say that the exact number of bytes is 1,099,511,627,776 . The correct term used for this exact figure is tebibyte . Large organizations use terabytes of storage to hold massive amounts of data . People at home probably do not use terabytes , they would use gigabytes , megabytes and occasionally kilobytes . However , in the future terabytes of storage will probably be more common in home usage . In fact , according to this page on the Apple website , 2008 Apple iMac computers can be ordered with 1 TB hard drives . An external hard drive can be several terabytes . Usually , one terabyte of space costs between 100 and 150 $ .

The stamen is the male reproductive organ of a flower . It produces the pollen . The stamen has two parts : the anther , and the stalk . The anther contains microsporangia . Each microsporangium contains pollen mother cells . These undergo meiosis , and produce pollen grains , which contain the male gametes ( sperm ) . The pollen grains are actually haploid male gametophytes . The pollen is released by the opening of the anther . The pollen is carried by some agent ( wind , or some animal ) to the receptive surface of the carpel of the same or another flower . This process is known as pollination . After successful pollination , the pollen grain ( immature microgametophyte ) completes its development by growing a pollen tube and undergoing mitosis to produce two male gametes .

A substance is protonated by a substance more acidic than it . The acidic substance is deprotonated .

In physiology , transduction is the conversion or change of a stimulus from one form to another . Transduction in the nervous system typically means synaptic events where an electrical signal is converted into a chemical one by the release of neurotransmitters . In sensory transduction a chemical or physical stimulus is transduced by sensory receptors into an electrical signal . For example , in the visual system , sensory cells called rod and cone cells in the retina change the physical energy of light signals into electrical impulses that travel to the brain . The light causes a change in a protein called rhodopsin . In this example , more light hitting the receptor results in the transduction of a signal into fewer electrical impulses .

For the Wikipedia guideline on prose , see Manual of Style . Prose is the ordinary form of the written ( or spoken ) language . Not poetry , and not any special format such as lists or tables . In writing , it is without special rhythm , and is similar to everyday communication . That makes the most important distinction with poetry , and with theatrical works such as plays . The word prose comes from the Latin prosa , meaning straightforward , hence the term `` prosaic '' . Prose writing is usually adopted for the description of facts or the discussion of whatever one 's thoughts are , incorporated in free flowing speech . It may be used for newspapers , novels , magazines , encyclopedias , broadcast media , letters , stories , history , philosophy , biography , and many other forms of media . Prose generally has no formal structure , like meter or rhyme , that is often found in poetry . Therefore it is used to describe literature which is non-poetic , and non-theatrical . There is , however , a blend of the two forms of literature is known as prose poetry .

The Brahui ( Urdu spelling : Ø Ø Ù Û Û ) or Bravi ( Ø Ø Ø Ù Ù ) language , spoken by the Brahui , it is the only Dravidian language mainly spoken in Pakistan , although it is also spoken in Afghanistan and Iran . The 2005 edition of Ethnologue reports some 2.2 million speakers , 90 % of whom live in Pakistan . In Pakistan it is mainly spoken in the Kalat region of Balochistan . Although it is a Dravidian language , it has been heavily influenced by the Iranian languages spoken in the area such as Balochi . Brahui is often considered to be a remnant of a formerly more widespread Dravidian language family that was speculated to have reduced during the Indo-Aryan migration . It is also sometimes speculated that Brahui might be a direct legacy of the Indus Valley Civilisation . However , one polar opposite view is that Brahuis migrated up to Baluchistan in the 13 or 14th century or by a late immigration that took place after 1000 CE .

Remains are known from several localities in the Santa Cruz Province , of Argentina . Phorusrhacos stood around 2.5 meters ( 8 ft ) tall and weighed approximately 130 kilograms ( 280 lbs ) . It was nicknamed the `` Terror Bird '' for obvious reasons : it was one of the largest carnivorous birds ever to have existed , along with Titanis , Kelenken and Brontornis . Its rudimentary wings had claws shaped like a meat hook for tackling prey , which was then killed with the massive beak . It ate small mammals and carrion . Its skull was up to sixty centimeters long , armed with a powerful , hook-tipped beak . The structure of the beak and the large claws on the toes show that this was a bird of prey . It raced over the grassy plateaus and hills of Patagonia , catching small reptiles and mammals leaving larger prey to its more massive relatives such as Brontornis .

A chosen-plaintext attack ( CPA ) is an attack model for cryptanalysis which assume that the attacker has the capability to choose random plaintexts to be encrypted and obtain the corresponding ciphertexts . The goal of the attack is to gain some further information which reduces the security of the encryption scheme . In the worst case , a chosen-plaintext attack could expose secret information after calculating the secret key . Modern cryptography , is implemented in software or hardware and is used for a diverse range of applications ; for many applications , a chosen-plaintext attack is often very feasible . Chosen-plaintext attacks become extremely important in the context of public key cryptography , where the encryption key is public and attackers can encrypt any plaintext they choose . Any cipher that can prevent chosen-plaintext attacks is then also guaranteed to be secure against known-plaintext and ciphertext-only attacks ; this is a conservative approach to security .

A strait is a narrow , navigable channel of water that connects two larger navigable bodies of water . It most commonly means a channel of water that lies between two land masses , but it may also mean a navigable channel through a body of water that is not navigable , for example because it is too shallow , or because it contains an unnavigable reef or archipelago . The terms strait , channel , passage , sound and firth can be synonymous , but each is sometimes used with a slight difference of meaning . Many straits are economically important . Straits can lie on important shipping routes , and wars have been fought for control of these straits . Many artificial channels , called canals , have been constructed to connect two bodies of water over land . Although rivers and canals often form a bridge between two large lakes or a lake and a sea , they are not usually referred to as straits . Straits are typically much larger , wider structures that do not have water running in a single direction , and normally connect two seas .

Nuclear energy is the energy that holds together the nucleii of atoms . Atoms are the most simple blocks that make up matter . Every atom has in its center a very small nucleus . Normally , nuclear energy is hidden inside the atoms . However , some atoms are radioactive and send off part of their nuclear energy as radiation . Radiation is given off from the nucleus of unstable isotopes of radioactive substances . Nuclear energy can also be freed in two other ways : nuclear fusion and nuclear fission . Nuclear fusion is the combining of two atoms into one and nuclear fission is the splitting of an atom . Both ways make big amounts of energy . They sometimes take place in nature . Fusion is the source of heat in the sun . Fission is also used in nuclear power plants to make electricity . Both fusion and fission can be used in nuclear weapons .

In cryptography , a pre-shared key or PSK is a shared secret which was previously shared between the two parties using some secure channel before it is used . Such systems almost always use symmetric key cryptographic algorithms . The characteristics of this secret or key are determined by the system which uses it ; some system require that such keys be in a specific format . It can be a password like ` bret13i ' , a passphrase like ` Idaho hung gear id gene ' , or a hexadecimal string like ' 65E4 E556 8622 EEE1 ' . The secret is used by all systems involved in the cryptographic processes used to secure the traffic between the systems . The term is used in Wi-Fi encryption such as WEP or WPA , where both the wireless access points ( AP ) and all clients share the same key . Since one weakpoint of the crypto system is the encryption algorithm 's key , the key strength is important , and since the strength of a key is in part dependent on the key length , it is important to choose a key whose length is cryptographically secure ( see password strength ) . There are several tools available to help one choose a strong key . The Diceware method is one example .
A silver medal is a medal given to the second place finisher of contests ( usually sports competitions ) such as the Olympic Games or Commonwealth Games . First and third place finishers usually receive a gold medal and bronze medal , respectively . In 1896 , winners ' medals were made from silver . The custom of gold-silver-bronze for the first three places dates from the 1904 games . It has been copied for many other sports events . Creating the medals is the responsibility of the host city . From 1928-1968 the design was always the same . One side showed a design by Florentine artist Giuseppe Cassioli with text giving the host city . The other side showed another design of an Olympic champion . From 1972-2000 , Cassioli 's design ( or a slight reworking ) remained on the one with a custom design by the host city on the other . Because Cassioli 's design showed a Roman amphitheatre for what was originally a Greek games , a new design was create for the Athens 2004 Games . Winter Olympics medals have been of more varied design . In The Open Championship golf tournament , the Silver Medal is an award given to the lowest scoring amateur player at the tournament .

Nadsat is a slang language . It was invented by Anthony Burgess when he wrote a book called A Clockwork Orange . The book is about a teenager called Alex. Alex speaks Nadsat in the book . Stanley Kubrick turned the book into a film , also called A Clockwork Orange . The name of the slang language Nadsat comes from Russian . So do many words in the language itself . In Russian , numbers between ten and twenty end with - nadsat . This is like the way the same numbers end with - teen in English . So Nadsat means ` teen ' . Although there is 1950s Russian slang in Nadsat , there are other languages too . However , most words in Nadsat are English or variations of English . One type of English variation used is rhyming slang .

Swiss cheese is a group of cheeses with holes in them . These cheeses got their name because they look like Swiss Emmental cheese . Swiss cheese is famous for having holes . The holes are created by the bacteria which change milk to Swiss cheese . Propionibacter uses the lactic acid which is produced by other bacteria , and produces carbon dioxide gas ; the gas slowly forms bubbles which makes the holes . The holes of the cheese are called the `` eyes '' , and a Swiss cheese which does not have holes is called a `` blind '' cheese . In general , Swiss cheeses with larger eyes have a better taste . This is because the same factors that make the eyes larger , make the taste of the cheese better too . These factors include longer time and higher temperature given to the cheese to form .

Viscosity index or VI is measure of the temperature at which a lubricating oil works properly . The VI scale goes from 0 to 100 , with 0 being the worst , and 100 being the best . New products are now better than when the scale was first made , so some new products have scores as high as 400 . Lubricating oil is meant to reduce friction between two surfaces . If it is too viscous the oil will be thick and sticky and need too much energy to keep the parts moving . If the oil is too thin , then the parts will rub together and create friction . What is needed is an oil that has just the right amount of viscosity to keep the two surfaces apart . Oil becomes less viscous as the temperature goes up . In an automobile engine , the oil needs to be viscous at a range of temperatures . It needs to work when the engine is first started and is cold , and keep working when the engine gets very hot , perhaps as much as 200 Â C. The best oils , with a high viscosity index score , will keep their viscosity the same across the temperature range . The scale was made up by the Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE ) .

Reform means a useful change , or sometimes reversion to a pure original state . Reform is generally distinguished from revolution . Revolution means basic or radical change ; reform may be no more than fine tuning , or the removing of serious wrongs without changing the whole system . Reform seeks to improve the system as it stands , never to overthrow it . The UK government frequently uses the term `` reform '' to describe changes to public services , such as the National Health Service . But these changes are not accepted by all people as useful . A note about grammar : when used to describe something which is physically formed again , such as re-casting it in a mold\/mould , or a band that gets back together , the proper term is re-form ( with a hyphen ) , not `` reform '' .

A season finale may contain a cliffhanger ending to be resolved in the next season . Alternatively , a season finale could bring open-ended storylines to a close , `` going out on a high '' and similarly maintaining interest in the series ' eventual return .

In American English , the term has developed to describe the final event of a sporting season , e.g. in soccer or Motocross , perhaps partly because of the popularity of these with television viewers .

Monocytes are a type of white blood cell , part of the human body 's immune system . They are usually identified in stained smears by their large two-lobed nucleus . They are a kind of reserve cell which turn into macrophages and immune helper cells called dendritic cells . Half of all monocytes are stored as a reserve in the spleen ; the rest are circulating or in tissues . Monocytes are produced by the bone marrow from stem cell precursors called monoblasts . Monocytes circulate in the bloodstream for about one to three days and then typically move into tissues throughout the body . They make up three to eight percent of the leukocytes in the blood . Monocytes which migrate from the bloodstream to the tissues will then differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells , which then stay in the tissue . Macrophages are responsible for protecting tissues from foreign substances . They are cells that possess a large smooth nucleus , a large area of cytoplasm and many internal vesicles for processing foreign material . Monocytes and their macrophage and dendritic cell progeny serve three main functions in the immune system . These are phagocytosis , antigen presentation and cytokine production .

A ledger line is a short line used to write notes which would otherwise be too high or too low for the staff . A short line ( slightly longer than the note ) is drawn parallel to the lines on the staff , and the note head is placed on that line or in the space below or above it . Notes more than two or three leger lines below the treble clef stave or two or three leger lines above the bass clef stage are rarely used . It is usually easier to change the clef . Notes more than four or five leger lines above the treble clef stave or below the bass clef stage also become hard to read . These very high or very low notes are easier to read if an â 8va â sign ( called `` ottava '' sign ) followed by little dots is placed above or below the notes . This means they are to be played an octave higher ( or lower ) than written . The piccolo always sounds an octave higher than the music written and the double bass always sounds an octave lower than written . Some wind instruments also transpose up or down an octave to make it easier to read , e.g. the bass clarinet sounds a ninth ( just over an octave ) lower than the music which is written in the treble clef ( this makes it the same fingering as the clarinet ) .

Brithenig is constructed language that was made up by Andrew Smith from New Zealand in 1996 . The idea behind it is the question what the Welsh language would have looked like if it had been a Romance instead of a Celtic language : a sister language to French , Spanish and Italian , but one that looks much like Welsh . It plays a key-role in the made-up world of Ill Bethisad , where Latin took the place of Old Celtic as the spoken language of the people in Great Britain , thus giving way to the development of Brithenig .

The title role in a play or an opera is the role ( the part ) which is also the title of the play or opera . We say that the actor , singer or dancer who performs that part has the title role . For example : in the opera Carmen by Georges Bizet the part played by the girl called Carmen is the `` title role '' . We may say that a singer took the title role in the opera Carmen . That means that she sang the part of Carmen in the opera . The title role is not necessarily the most important role in the play or opera , although it often is . A few other well-known examples in which the performance is named after one of the characters include the operas Aida ( by Giuseppe Verdi ) , Madame Butterfly ( by Giacomo Puccini ) and Peter Grimes ( by Benjamin Britten ) , the ballets CoppÃ lia ( by LÃ o Delibes ) or Petrushka ( by Stravinsky ) , or the plays Othello or Hamlet ( by William Shakespeare ) . The title character in fiction is the fictional character whose name is in the title ( or suggested in the title ) , such as Harry Potter in Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling , or Simba in Disney 's The Lion King ( Simba is the Lion King ) . `` Title character '' always refers to a fictional character .

In geography , an oasis is an isolated place in the desert where there is vegetation . Most often , this occurs around a source of water . Oases provide a habitat for animals and are used as a source of water for humans . The knowledge of the location of oases has been important for trade and transportation routes in desert areas . Caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be refilled . Thus , political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route . For example , the oases of Awjila , Ghadames and Kufra , in modern-day Libya , have at various times been vital to both North-South and East-West trade in the Sahara desert . The word oasis came into English via Greek á 1\/2 Î Ï Î Ï , which was borrowed from Egyptian wá 3t or Demotic wá á '' . It was not borrowed from Coptic ouaá e ( \* \/ waÄ e \/ ) , as is sometimes suggested ; the Greek word is attested several centuries before Coptic existed as a written language .

In mathematics , a quotient is the end result of a division problem . For example , in the problem 6 Ã 3 , the quotient would be 2 . Then 6 would be called the dividend , and 3 the divisor . The quotient can also be expressed as the number of times the divisor divides into the dividend . A quotient can also mean just the integral part of the result of dividing two integers . For example , the quotient of 13 Ã 5 would be 2 while the remainder would be 3 . Quotients also come up in certain tests , like the IQ test , which stands for intelligence quotient . In this case , your quotient is basically your score . In recent decades , as people begin to emphasize on full personal development , other similar quotients appeared .

The notochord is a flexible , rod-shaped body found in embryos of all chordates . It forms the axis of the embryo . In some chordates , it persists throughout life as the main support down the length of the body . In most vertebrates it is replaced by the vertebral column . The notochord is found ventral ( underneath ) the neural tube ( future spinal chord ) . Notochords were the first `` backbones '' serving as support structures in chordates . Notochords were advantageous to primitive fish-ancestors because they were a rigid structure for muscle attachment , yet flexible enough to allow movement . Embryos of vertebrates have notochords today , as embryonic development often follows a pattern similar to the ancestral evolution of the modern animal 's traits .

The planetary core is the innermost layer or layers in a planet . The terrestrial planets ( planets with a rocky surface ) have a core mainly made of iron and could be a solid or a liquid layer . The Earth 's core is partially liquid , while the cores of Mars and Venus are thought to be completely solid , because the cores do not make a magnetic field . The gas giants also have a core made of iron . Their cores are very small , in proportion to their large size . However , the gas giants are so large that their cores can still be larger than the Earth 's core . Jupiter 's core is estimated to be 12 times the mass of the Earth 's . A core 's size can vary from each planet or other object . The moon 's core is 20 % of its radius , butMercury 's core is 75 % of its radius .

It was announced on October 14 in IAUC 3878 along with optical confirmation by Charles T. Kowal , who reported that it looks like an asteroid . It was the first asteroid to be found by a spacecraft . It measures 5.10 km in diameter . Phaethon approaches the Sun closer than any other numbered asteroid . Its perihelion ( closest approach to the Sun ) is only 0.140 AU -- less than half Mercury 's perihelion distance . It is a Mercury - , Venus - , Earth - and Mars-crosser . The surface temperature at perihelion could reach ~ 1025 K , or 1400 F. For this reason , it was named after the Greek myth of PhaÃ `` ton , son of the sun god Helios . Phaethon approached to 18.1 Gm on December 10,2007 . It will draw nearer in 2017 , 2050 , 2060 , and closer still on December 14 , 2093 , passing within 0.0198 AU ( 3.0 Gm ) .

When this music is printed today , sometimes it is still printed in the same way . Mozart wrote two piano concertos in a minor key , and one of them is in C minor , No. 24 , K. 491 . C minor has had the meaning of heroic struggle from Beethoven 's time . One of the most famous pieces in this key is his Symphony No. 5 . The fact that Brahms 's Symphony No. 1 is also in C minor helped it get its nickname as `` Beethoven 's Tenth '' ( Beethoven 's actual unfinished Symphony No. 10 in E flat major may have had a significant central C minor section in the first movement ) . Three of Anton Bruckner 's ten numbered symphonies are in C minor .

Velvet is a type of woven tufted fabric in which the cut threads are very evenly distributed , with a short dense pile , giving it a distinctly smooth feel . Velvet can be made from many different fibers . It is woven on a special loom that weaves two pieces of velvet at the same time . The two pieces are then cut apart and the two lengths of fabric are wound on separate take-up rolls . Velvet is difficult to clean due to its pile , but modern dry cleaning methods perform well . Velvet is made , ideally , from silk . More recently , synthetic velvets have been developed , mostly polyester , nylon , viscose , acetate , and mixtures of different synthetics , or synthetics and natural fibers ( e.g. viscose and silk ) . A small percentage of lycra is used sometimes to give stretch . The art of velvet-weaving probably originated in medieval Kashmir around the beginning of the fourteenth century . King Richard II of England directed in his will that his body should be clothed in velveto in 1399 . The earliest sources of European artistic velvets were weavers in Lucca , Genoa , Florence and Venice .

The flag of Alabama was adopted by the Alabama state legislature on February 16 , 1895 . It 's believed that the crimson saltire of the Flag of Alabama was designed to look like the blue saltire of the Confederate Battle Flag . The Battle Flag was square-shaped , and Alabama 's flag is sometimes shown as a square . The authors of a 1917 article in National Geographic expressed their opinion that because the Alabama flag was based on the Battle Flag , it should be square . In 1987 , Don Siegelman issued an opinion in which the Battle Flag derivation is repeated , but concluded that the proper shape is rectangular , as it had been depicted numerous times in official publications and reproductions . However , the saltire design of the Alabama state flag also looks like several other flags . It is identical to the flag of St. Patrick , incorporated into the Union Flag of the United Kingdom to represent the union of the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland . This has led to other origins being put forth as possibilities .

Insects have small holes in their bodies that allow them to breathe . These holes are called spiracles . Air comes in the spiracles and goes to trachea , or tubes . These tubes take the oxygen to other parts of the insect body . Because insects have no lungs , air comes in and goes out of the spiracles passively ( by itself ) . Some insects can open and close the spiracles to keep water out . Some spiders also have spiracles . Sharks and rays have a spiracle behind each eye . When the shark is not moving , the spiracle helps the shark to breathe .
A triode is a type of vacuum tube . It differs from a vacuum tube diode , which has only two electrodes , by having a third electrode , called the grid between the cathode and anode . When the cathode is heated , it gives out electrons . Then , the anode absorbs electrons . This process makes an electric current , which is controlled by the grid . The addition of the grid allows the triode to be used as an amplifier . Lee De Forest invented this device in 1908 from his original two-electrode Audion of 1906 . The triode incorporates the key principle of amplification . The name triode emerged because people needed to distinguish it from other similar vacuum tubes ( for example , diodes , tetrodes , pentodes , etc. ) The triode can not only do amplification but also work as part of an oscillator ( making waves ) and detecting waves . It is used in radios , but the transistor has mostly replaced it starting in the 1960s . It is an ancestor of the transistor . It is still used in vacuum tube amplifiers .

A burrow is a hole or tunnel that was dug into the ground by an animal to create a space that can be used for living or short time shelter . The burrowing way of life is quite popular among the animals . Many animals construct or use burrows in many different types . Mammals are perhaps most well-known for burrowing , especially Insectivora like the voracious mole , and rodents like the fertile gopher and groundhog . The rabbit , a member of the family Lagomorpha , is a well-known burrower . There are estimations that a single groundhog burrow occupies a full cubic meter , displacing 320 kilograms of dirt . Even Carnivora like the meerkat and Marsupials like the kangaroo mouse are burrowers . Burrows can be constructed into a wide variety of substrates . Kangaroo mice construct burrows in fine sand . Termites construct burrows in wood . Some sea urchins and clams can burrow into rock . Burrows can also range in complexity from a simple tube a few centimeters long to a complex network of interconnecting tunnels and chambers hundreds or thousands of meters in total length , such as a well-developed rabbit warren .

; Author abbreviation To encourage consistency the ICBN recommends ( Recommendation 46A , Note 1 ) the use of Brummitt & Powell 's Authors of plant names ( 1992 ) , where each author of a botanical name has been assigned a unique abbreviation . These standard abbreviations can be found at the IPNI , Author Query page . For example in : ; Author name This is the name of the article in which the template is placed , refactored if necessary to place the surname first . For example , Philip Miller would become Miller , Philip , but Kim Dong Ho remains Kim Dong Ho , because `` Kim '' is the surname . Because the sorting rules of Wikipedia are fixed , and may not match the sorting of any given language , diacriticals should either be converted ( Johann Lucas SchÃ nlein becomes Schoenlein , Johann Lucas ) or removed ( JuliÃ n AcuÃ a GalÃ becomes Acuna Gale , Julian ) .
Evolutionary biology is a subfield of biology that studies how species start and change over time or in other words , how species evolve . Someone who studies evolutionary biology is known as an evolutionary biologist . Evolutionary biology as an academic subject emerged as a result of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s . It was not until the 1970s and 1980s that universities had departments that specifically included the term evolutionary biology in their titles . In the United States , as a result of the rapid growth of molecular and cell biology , many universities have split ( or aggregated ) their biology departments into molecular and cell biology-style departments and ecology and evolutionary biology-style departments . These have included older departments such as paleontology , zoology and the like .

A trough is an elongated area of comparatively low atmospheric pressure , usually in association with weather fronts . Convective cells may form in the surrounding area of troughs and give birth to a tropical cyclone . Some tropical or subtropical areas , such as the Philippines or south China are greatly affected by convection cells along a trough . In the mid-latitude westerlies , troughs and ridges often exchange with each other , especially when upper-level winds are in a high-amplitude pattern . For a trough in the westerlies , the region just west of the trough axis is typically an area of convergent winds and descending air - and hence high pressure - while the region just east of the trough axis is an area of fast , divergent winds and low pressure . Tropical waves are a type of trough in easterly currents , a cyclonic northward deflection of the trade winds .

Emperor Seimu was the 13th emperor of Japan , according to the traditional order of succession . Historians consider Emperor Seimu to be a legendary person , and the name Seimu-tenn Å was created for him posthumously by later generations . No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign . The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as `` traditional '' until the reign of Emperor Kammu , who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty . Seimu is almost certainly a legend ; but the Kojiki and Nihonshoki record his name . The limited information about Seimu does not imply that no such person ever existed . Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch , Emperor Kimmei . This emperor 's posthumous name must must have been regularized many centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Seimu . The actual site of his grave is not known . This emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ( misasagi ) at Nara .

The seminal vesicles are a pair of tube-like glands . They are found behind the bladder of males . They make a large most of the content of semen ( also called seminal fluid ) . About 70 % of the seminal fluid in humans comes from the seminal vesicles . Both vesicles are about 5 cm in length , but it is curled up . Each gland makes a ball shape on the wall of each vas deferens . There is a tube linking the seminal glands which opens into the vas deferens and prostate gland . The seminal vesicles make most of semen , but during ejaculation , most of the ejaculate has sperm rather than semen in it . The use of seminal fluid is not known , since sperm do not move or survive well in semen . Some think that it acts as a fluid to stop sperm from another male impregnating the female so that the children of only one male can survive . Seminal fluid has proteins , enzymes , fructose , mucus , vitamin C and flavins . The fructose gives sperm energy and ` food ' .

Smith said ( IAUC 4806 ) its discovery on July 7 , 1989 , speaking only of â 17 frames taken over 21 daysâ , which gives a discovery date of sometime before June 16 . The name was given on 16 September 1991 . Proteus is more than 400 kilometres in diameter , bigger than Nereid , another moon of Neptune . However , it was not found by Earth-based telescopes because it is so close to the planet that it is lost in the glare of reflected sunlight . Proteus is one of the darkest objects in the solar system . Like Saturn 's moon Phoebe , it reflects only 6 percent of the sunlight that hits it . Proteus is very cratered , showing no sign of any geological changes . It is also not a sphere ; scientists believe Proteus is about as big as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity . Saturn 's moon Mimas has much more spherical shape despite being less massive than Proteus .

Phonetic theory regards the nature of sounds in speech ( called phones ) and how they are made , heard and thought of . Phonology , which came from it , studies sound systems and sound units ( such as phonemes and distinctive features ) . Phonetics is one of the two parts of orthographical linguistics , the other part being spelling , differing from grammar and lexis . There are more than 100 different phones recognized by the International Phonetic Association ( IPA ) and are shown in their writing system called the International Phonetic Alphabet . The first time phonetics was studied was 2,500 years ago in what is now India , with PÄ á ini , when he wrote about the place and manner of articulation of consonants in Sanskrit in his 5th century BC essay on Sanskrit linguistics . The major Indic scripts today order their consonants the way PÄ á ini did .

Square Foot Gardening is a type of gardening popularized by Mel Bartholemew . It is based on the idea that the wide rows in traditional home gardening are a waste of time , work , water and space , and that more quality vegetables can be grown in less space with less effort . In this method , the garden space is divided into beds ( a 4 ' x 4 ' , 16 sq ft or 120cm x 120cm , 1.4 mÂ garden being recommended ) and separated by paths . These beds are further divided into squares of approximately one square foot , and planted with your vegetables . Common spacing is one plant\/square for larger plants such as broccoli , basil , etc. . four\/square for medium large plants like lettuce , nine\/square for medium - small plants like spinach , and sixteen\/square for small plants such as onions and carrots . Other plant spacings can be found in the `` in row spacing '' on seed packets . The beds are weeded and watered from the pathways , so the garden soil is not compacted . This article or section was marked as containing `` how-to '' information and has now been successfully imported to Wikibooks . You can find it on Wikibooks under the name Square foot gardening . .

Liberal Christianity is a term which is used for several movements in Christianity . These movements formed between the 18th and 20th century . Their philosophical and theological ideas have been influenced by those of Enlightenment . They are not liberal in a political sense . They want to remain independent from dogmas defined by the different Christian Churches . When Liberal Christians interpret scripture , like the Bible , they do not think that what is written is true by default . They also do not think that certain things are true because a Christian Church made them into a dogma . A Liberal Christian may have certain beliefs that are the same as those of more conservative Christians . Well known proponents include Hans KÃ 1\/4 ng , Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Albert Schweitzer .

In mathematics , particularly number theory , a probable prime is a whole number that is likely to be prime by having passed a probabilistic test such as Fermat 's primality test . Probable primes may be composite , but the tests are designed so they are really unlikely to be composite . These probabilistic tests are easier to do than tests that actually guarantee primality , and the composite probable primes are useful too in encryption that uses prime numbers .

Pollutants are compounds which are dangerous to the environment . They can also be harmful to humans in the long-term range . They come from mineral and fossil sources or are produced by humans themselves . Many pollutants have a poisonous effect on the body . Carbon monoxide is an example of a substance which is damaging to humans . This compound is taken up in the body instead of oxygen . That makes the body suffocate and in severe cases may lead to death . Some pollutants became dangerous by reaction with other naturally occurring compounds . The oxides of nitrogen and sulfur are released from impurities in fossil fuels when they are burnt . They react with water vapor in the atmosphere to become acid rain . Acid rain damages buildings and makes lakes unable to support marine life , which causes fish and water plants to die .

The meeting hall of the Estates General had been locked accidentally , but the Third Estate thought that this was an invasion of their rights , and were very angry with the king . They stood in a nearby indoor tennis court . They swore an oath that they would not move until `` the voice of the nation was heard '' and their demands were met .

A week later , the king agreed and the Estates General met as the `` National Assembly '' .

A Sawfly is an insect belonging to suborder Symphyta of the Order Hymenoptera . The sawflies are a group of largely plant-eating ( herbivorous ) insects . The group is less specialised than the ants , bees and wasps . Sawflies are distinguishable from most other Hymenoptera by the broad connection between the abdomen and the thorax , and by their caterpillar-like larvae . The common name comes from the saw-like appearance of the ovipositor , which the females use to cut into the plants where they lay their eggs . Large populations of certain sawfly species can cause substantial economic damage to forests and cultivated plants . The Xyelidae is a small family of sawflies known from fewer than 50 extant species in 5 genera , with an extensive fossil record . They are the oldest fossil Hymenoptera , dating back to the Triassic , some 200 million years ago . Most species occur in the Northern hemisphere , especially in boreal regions , though there are a few neotropical species . Most are associated with conifers ( esp . Pinus and Abies ) , where the larvae feed on pollen or within buds , though larvae of a few species feed on the leaves of deciduous trees .

Any process in which relatively small molecules , called monomers , combine chemically to produce a very large chainlike or network molecule , called a polymer . The monomer molecules may all be alike , or they may represent two , three , or more different compounds . Usually at least 100 monomer molecules must be combined to make a product that has certain unique physical propertiesâ '' such as elasticity , high tensile strength , or the ability to form fibresâ '' that differentiate polymers from substances composed of smaller and simpler molecules ; often , many thousands of monomer units are incorporated in a single molecule of a polymer . The formation of stable covalent chemical bonds between the monomers sets polymerization apart from other processes , such as crystallization , in which large numbers of molecules aggregate under the influence of weak intermolecular forces .

In mathematics , a Riemann sum is a sum that makes an approximation of the total area underneath a curve on a graph . The area can be known as the integral . It may also be used to define the integration operation . The sum is named after a German mathematician who was called Bernhard Riemann . You divide the horizontal length under the part of the function you want to evaluate into `` n '' equal pieces . That is the n on top of the Î # ( Greek letter sigma ) . The ( xi-xi-1 ) represents the size of one horizontal segment that is created from dividing the whole by the `` n '' . The f ( yi ) is a y value in an `` n '' segment . Since the area of a rectangle is length width , the multiplication of xi and f ( yi ) is the area of a rectangle for that part of the graph . The Î # means we add up all of these small rectangles to get an approximation of the area under the segment of a function .

For the moon of Jupiter , see Metis ( moon ) . 9 Metis is one of the biggest main belt asteroids . It is made of silicates and metallic nickel-iron , and may be the core remnant of a big asteroid that was destroyed by an ancient collision . Metis was found by Andrew Graham on April 25 , 1848 ; it was his only asteroid discovery . It is also the only asteroid to have been found as a result of observations from Ireland . Its name comes from the mythological Metis , a Titaness and Oceanid , daughter of Tethys and Oceanus . The name Thetis was also considered and rejected ( it would later devolve to 17 Thetis ) . Metis ' direction of rotation is unknown at present . Hubble space telescope images and lightcurve analyses are in agreement that Metis has a non-spherical stretched shape with one pointed and one broad end . Radar observations suggest the presence of a significant flat area , in agreement with the shape model from lightcurves . What the surface is made of has been estimated as 30-40 % metal-bearing olivine and 60-70 % Ni-Fe metal . Light curve data on Metis led to an assumption that it could have a moon . However , subsequent observations failed to confirm this . Later searches with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1993 found no moons . Metis has been seen to occult stars no less than 5 times .

Art history is the study of art . An art historian is a person who studies the history of art , and then writes about it or teaches about it so that other people can learn about this subject as well . The first person to become an art historian was Giorgio Vasari . He lived in Florence during the Renaissance , at a time when there were many famous artists alive . Vasari was an artist himself . He decided to write down all the stories that were told in Florence about the many different artists who had made the city famous . He included biographies of several other artists from Northern Italy as well . When all the information was collected and the biographies written , he published them in 1568 in a book called Lives of the Artists . Because of this book , art students today have a lot of information about artists such as Leonardo , Michelangelo , Titian and their works .

Australopithecus anamensis is a fossil species of Australopithecus . The first fossilized specimen of the species , though not recognized as such at the time , was a single arm bone found in Pliocene strata in the Kanapoi region of East Lake Turkana by a Harvard University research team in 1965 . The specimen was tentatively assigned at the time to Australopithecus and dated about four million years old . Little additional information was uncovered until 1987 , when Canadian archaeologist Allan Morton ( with Harvard University 's Koobi Fora Field School ) discovered fragments of a specimen protruding from a partially eroded hillside east of Allia Bay , near Lake Turkana , Kenya . Six years later the London-born Kenyan paleoanthropologist Meave Leakey and archaeologist Alan Walker excavated the Allia Bay site and uncovered several additional fragments of the hominid , including one complete lower jaw bone which closely resembles that of a common chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ) but whose teeth are much more similar to those of a human . In 1995 , Meave Leakey and her associates , taking note of differences between Australopithecus afarensis and the new finds , assigned them to a new species , A. anamensis , deriving its name from the Turkana word anam , meaning `` lake '' .

Stalagmites may also refer to a type of fungus . A stalagmite is a form that can be found on the floor of a cave . It rises from the floor of a limestone cave when mineralized solutions drip from the ceiling and deposits of calcium carbonate form columns on the ground . The corresponding formation on the ceiling of a cave is known as a stalactite . When touring caves with stalactites and stalagmites you might be asked to not touch the rock formations . This is generally because the formation is considered to still be growing and forming . Since the rock buildup is formed by minerals solidifying out of the water solution , skin oils can disturb where the mineral water will cling . So the development of the rock formation will be affected and not natural anymore . Stalactites and stalagmites can also form on concrete ceilings and floors , but they form much more rapidly there than in the natural cave environment .

A hydride is a compound with hydrogen bonded to other elements . Except for a few of the Noble gases , all of the elements in the periodic table can form hydrides . The properties of hydrides can be very different , but some of the hydrides have similar properties . Ionic hydrides : compounds with ionic bonding . They are very reactive , making them difficult to dissolve . Most alkali metals and alkaline earth metals form ionic hydrides . Metallic or Interstitial hydrides : These have metallic properties like good electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity . They are called interstitial because hydrogen can enter the metallic lattice ( framework of metal atoms ) . Metallic hydrides are mostly formed from the metals in the groups 3 to 5 of the periodic table . Some of these are used in the nickel metal-hydride battery . Covalent hydrides : These have covalent bonds between hydrogen and the other element . Most of the p-block elements form covalent hydrides . Many of these hydrides are unstable in air or water or when heated . Hydrocarbons are the hydrides of carbon , ammonia is a hydride of nitrogen , and water is a hydride of oxygen .

The passenger does much more work than the driver because he moves his whole body around all the time .

Another example of popular music in A-flat minor is Walkin ' on the Sun by Smash Mouth .

A crystal radio , sometimes called a crystal set , is a very simple AM radio receiver , that does not need batteries to work . A long wire antenna gathers enough of the radio signals from nearby transmitters to power a crystal diode , which demodulate the signals , and plays them as sound through an earphone or small headset . Crystal radios have come and gone many times in history . They were built in the early days of radio broadcasting by amateurs , and people who could not afford a well-made radio . They became popular again during the Great Depression , when money was scarce . During World War II , American soldiers built `` foxhole radios '' that used a razor blade and pencil point instead of a crystal . ( German and Italian troops had equipment that could detect normal radio receivers working , so an alternate choice was a wise one . ) After the war ended , amateurs built more crystal sets , and children began to make them as science and hobby projects . Later during the Vietnam War prisoners of war again built simple radios , and soldiers used Slinky springs as antennas . Hobby clubs still exist , that give information to persons who want to build a crystal radio or similar radio project .

StandartenfÃ 1\/4 hrer was a Nazi Party rank that was used in both the S.A. and the S.S. . First started as a rank in 1925 , in 1928 the rank became one of the first commissioned Nazi ranks and was given to S.A. and S.S. officers who commanded units known as Standarten which were between three hundred and five hundred men . In 1929 the rank of StandartenfÃ 1\/4 hrer was split into two ranks known as StandartenfÃ 1\/4 hrer ( I ) and StandartenfÃ 1\/4 hrer ( II ) . This idea was given up in 1930 when both the S.A. and S.S. grew their rank systems to allow for more ranks . By the start of World War II , StandartenfÃ 1\/4 hrer was widely used as both an SS rank and a rank of the S.A. . In the Waffen-SS , the rank was considered the equivalent of an Oberst ( colonel ) . The insignia for StandartenfÃ 1\/4 hrer was of a single oak leaf worn on both collars and was the first of the S.S. and S.A. ranks to be worn on both collars . From 1938 , newer SS uniforms featured the shoulder boards of a German Oberst as well as the oak leaf collar patches .

F-sharp minor is a minor scale based on F sharp . Its key signature has three sharps . Its relative major is A major . Many people think it is a melancholy and gloomy key . Harry Farjeon says that F sharp minor is `` light red '' , and that it is the key Mendelssohn uses when he is being passionate . Johann Mattheson wrote that ' F minor , although it leads to great distress , nevertheless is more languid and love-sick than lethal . Moreover , it has something abandoned , singular , and misanthropic about it . ' Very few symphonies are written in this key . Haydn 's Farewell Symphony is one famous example . George Frederick Bristow and Dora PejaÄ eviÄ also wrote symphonies in this key . Many piano pieces have been written in F-sharp minor . Mozart 's only composition in this key is the second movement to his Piano Concerto No. 23 in A major . 2 of Chopin 's 52 mazurkas , and 1 of his nocturnes are in this key , though he seems to have liked the related key C-sharp minor better . Scriabin 's Piano Sonata No. 3 is also in this key , and the 3rd movement of Beethoven 's `` Hammerklavier '' Piano Sonata is too . Both Reger 's and Tippett 's second string quartets are in this key , and so is Shostakovich 's seventh string quartet .

Nereid or Neptune II , is a moon of Neptune . Nereid was found on 1 May 1949 by Gerard P. Kuiper , who suggested the name in the report of his discovery . It is named after the Nereids , sea-nymphs of Greek mythology . It was the farthest of Neptune 's known moons for a long time ( Halimede through Neso have since taken that honor ) , and is the third biggest , with a diameter of 340 km . Its orbit averages 5,513,400 km in radius , but is very eccentric and varies from 1,353,600 to 9,623,700 kilometres . For a long time this was the most highly eccentric orbit of any known moon in the solar system , but it has found that Bestla , a recently discovered moon of Saturn has a more eccentric orbit . The unusual orbit suggests that it may be a captured asteroid or Kuiper belt object , or possibly that it was perturbed during the capture of Neptune 's largest moon Triton . Very little else is known of Nereid . Nereid was too far to be properly imaged by the Voyager 2 probe when it visited the Neptune system in 1989 . Photos sent back show only its very non-spherical shape , and no surface features could be seen at the resolution available .

Some types of distilled alcoholic drinks are also called spirits ( as a plural , not `` spirit '' ) . In many religions , a spirit is considered to be the part of a being that is not the body . Other words with the same meanings are soul and ghost . When a body is alive , it has a spirit in it . Death is when the spirit separates from the body . Some people think that without their bodies , spirits can still exist on the Earth and in places like Heaven or Hell . Some believe that spirits can talk with people , or change things in the world . Many religions forbid communicating with such spirits in any way , but a few include this as part of their practice . Another use of spirit means the main purpose or meaning of a sentence or document . For example , the `` spirit of a law '' is the meaning of the law which the creator wanted . This phrase is often used when the words and sentences of a law could mean more than one thing , but a judge must decide what meaning is correct .

A photocathode is a negatively charged electrode in a light detection device . They are the main type of photomultiplier . That means they take a little light , and make more of it . There are instruments which need to magnify the amount of light coming in . Examples are astronomical telescopes and military night-sight equipment : binoculars and telescopes on helmets and rifles etc. The lens of the telescope or binocular passes the light onto a layer of glass coated with a special light-sensitive metal . When this is struck by light , the absorbed energy causes electrons to jump off . This is called the ` photoelectric effect ' . The freed electrons are then collected to produce the final image . These devices are mostly based on alkali metals .

A session key is a single-use symmetric key used for encrypting all messages in one communication session . A closely related term is traffic encryption key or TEK , which refers to any symmetric key that is used to encrypt traffic messages . Typically TEKs are changed frequently , in some systems daily and in others for every message . Session keys introduce complexities in a cryptosystem . However , they also help with some real problems , which is why they are used . There are two primary reasons for using session keys : Like all cryptographic keys , session keys must be chosen so that they are unpredictable by an attacker . In the usual case , this means that they must be chosen randomly . Failure to choose session keys ( or any key ) properly is a major drawback in any cryptosystem .

A Margrave is a German nobleman . Originally the Holy Roman Emperor would give a Markgraf an area of the borders ( the Marches or ) to look after . The Margrave would have to protect the people in the area from invaders , and at the same time protect the empire . A Markgraf ranked higher than a count or earl , but lower than a duke . The Margraves of Brandenburg were in control of such an important area that they were made Electors of the Holy Roman Empire , which was the highest honor in the Imperial Parliament . There were no Kings in the Empire , so when the Margraves of Brandenburg took control of some territory outside the empire as well , they could call themselves King in Prussia . As the Middle Ages ended and Europe and the Holy Roman Empire became more secure the military importance of the Margraves became less . At the end of the German Empire in 1918 , there were no Markgrafs left . All had been given higher title , but may have kept the Markgraf title as an extra . The Kings of Prussia , for example , always kept the lower title Margraves of Brandenburg .

A spectrometer is an optical instrument used to measure properties of light over a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum . The independent variable is usually the wavelength of the light . The variable measured is most often the light 's intensity but could also , for instance , be the polarization state . A spectrometer is used in spectroscopy for producing spectral lines and measuring their wavelengths and intensities . Spectrometer is a term that is applied to instruments that operate over a very wide range of wavelengths , from gamma rays and X-rays into the far infrared . In general , any particular instrument will operate over a small portion of this total range because of the different techniques used to measure different portions of the spectrum . Below optical frequencies ( that is , at microwave , radio , and audio frequencies ) , the spectrum analyzer is a closely related electronic device . Spectrometers are used in spectroscopic analysis to identify materials . Spectroscopes are used often in astronomy and some branches of chemistry . Early spectroscopes were simply a prism with graduations marking wavelengths of light . Modern spectroscopes , such as monochromators , generally use a diffraction grating , a movable slit , and some kind of photodetector , all automated and controlled by a computer . The spectroscope was invented by Gustav Robert Georg Kirchhoff and Robert Wilhelm Bunsen .

In cryptography , a shared secret is a piece of data only known to the parties involved in a secure communication . The shared secret can be a password , a passphrase , a big number or an array of randomly chosen bytes . The shared secret is either shared before parties start to communicate ; in this case it can also be called a pre-shared key . Or it is created at the start of the communication session by using a key-agreement protocol , for-instance using public-key cryptography such as Diffie-Hellman or using symmetric-key cryptography such as Kerberos . The shared secret can be used for authentication ( for instance when logging in to a remote system ) using methods such as challenge-response or it can be fed to a key derivation function to produce one or more keys to use for encryption and\/or MACing of messages . To make unique session and message keys the shared secret is usually combined with an initialization vector ( IV ) . An example of this is the derived unique key per transaction method .

A mechanical wave requires a medium . Sound waves , waves in a Slinky and pressure waves are all examples of this phenomenon . Sound waves need a physical medium in order to exist ; the Slinky waves need the Slinky , and the waves in the ocean need the water . Like all waves , they have a frequency , period , wavelength and amplitude . Mechanical waves are a local oscillation of material . Only the energy propagates ; the oscillating material does not move far from its initial equilibrium position ; the wave travels by jumping from one particle of the medium to another . Therefore , mechanical waves transport energy and not material ;

The Multituberculata were a group of rodent-like mammals that existed for approximately 120 million years â `` the longest fossil history of any mammal lineage . They were eventually outcompeted by rodents , becoming extinct during the early Oligocene . At least 200 species are known , ranging from mouse-sized to beaver-sized . These species occupied many ecological niches , ranging from burrow-dwelling to squirrel-like tree-dwelling . Multituberculates are usually placed outside both the two main groups of living mammals , the Theria ( placentals and marsupials ) , and monotremes . Some cladistic analyses put them closer to Theria than to monotremes . The multituberculates had a head anatomy similar to rodents . They had cheek-teeth separated from the chisel-like front teeth by a wide tooth-less gap ( called the diastema ) . Each cheek-tooth displayed several rows of small cusps ( or tubercles , hence the name ) which worked against similar rows in the teeth of the jaw . It was an efficient chopping device . Most small multituberculates would have eaten seeds and nuts , supplemented with insects , worms , and fruit . The structure of the pelvis in the Multituberculata suggests that they gave birth to tiny helpless young , similar to modern marsupials .

216 Kleopatra is a Main belt asteroid found by Johann Palisa on April 10 , 1880 in Pola . It is named after Cleopatra , the Queen of Egypt . Kleopatra is an unusual object . Its odd shape was revealed by adaptive optics on the ESO 3.6 m telescope at La Silla . By bouncing radar signals off the asteroid , a team of astronomers at the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico were able to develop a more detailed computer model of its shape , which confirmed the dog-bone like shape . A favored explanation is that Kleopatra is a contact binary : two similarly-sized asteroids that have hit and stuck together instead of breaking apart . Kleopatra is a fairly big asteroid , measuring 217 Ã -- 94 Ã -- 81 km . It is believed to be a loosely packed metallic object , based on its radar albedo .

Almost all of Great Britain 's public clocks were using GMT by 1855 . Before 1883 , local mean time was used in all of North America . This meant there were many different local times . This caused problems for train schedules . Sandford Fleming , a Canadian , proposed standard time at a meeting of the Royal Canadian Institute on February 8 , 1879 .

There is not one definition of organic matter only . It varies upon the subject it is being used for . Soil is composed of minerals and organic matter , as well as living organisms . The organic matter in soil comes from plants and animals . In a forest , for example , leaf litter and woody material falls to the forest floor . This is sometimes called organic material .

The Proteobacteria are a major phylum of bacteria . They are Gram-negative bacteria . This means they do not retain the violet dye in the Gram staining protocol . In a Gram stain test , a counterstain ( commonly safranin ) is added after the crystal violet , coloring all Gram-negative bacteria with a pink color . The test itself is useful in classifying two distinct types of bacteria based on the structural differences of their cell walls . Proteobacteria include a wide variety of pathogens , such as Escherichia coli , Salmonella , Vibrio , Helicobacter , and many other notable genera . Others are free-living , and include many of the bacteria responsible for nitrogen fixation . The group is defined primarily in terms of ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) sequences . Most members are facultatively or obligately anaerobic , chemoautotrophs , and heterotrophic , but there are numerous exceptions . There are alphaproteobacteria in this phylum which are widely found in marine plankton . They may constitute over 10 % of the open ocean microbial community .

In physics , pair production is what happens when a photon interacts with the nucleus of an atom , instead of the electron like in lower level x-ray interactions . The photon gives its energy to the nucleus and then creates a pair of positively and negatively charged electrons . The positive electron ( positron ) ionizes until it combines with a free electron . The two photons scatter in opposite directions . The probability of pair production is proportional to the energy of the incoming photon and is affected by the material 's atomic number . Pair production usually happens with energy levels over 25 MeV . Pair production happens sometimes in radiation therapy treatments with high-energy photon beams .

An unconformity is a buried erosion surface separating two rock strata of different ages . It shows that sediment deposition was broken for a time . Usually , the older layer was exposed to erosion for some time before deposition of the younger . However , the term is used to describe any break in the sedimentary record . Many millions of years may separate the rocks above and below the discontinuity . James Hutton found examples of unconformity in Scotland , at Jedburgh in 1787 and at Siccar Point in 1788 . The rocks above an unconformity are younger than the rocks beneath ( unless the sequence has been overturned ) . An unconformity represents time during which no sediments were preserved in the region . The local record for that time interval is missing and geologists must use other clues to discover that part of the geologic history of that area . The interval of geologic time not represented is called a hiatus ( = ` gap ' ) .

Roman Ã clef ( said like it rhymes with `` a don a day '' ) means `` novel with a key '' in French . It is a phrase used for talking about literature and film . A roman Ã clef is a type of story that 's true for the most part except for details like the name of the main character . The `` key '' part of the meaning -- what someone needs to unlock the real story -- changes from book to book . For some books it is knowing that the main character is really a famous person . For others it is knowing that the main character is really the author . Authors usually write these types of stories ( instead of telling the whole truth ) to talk about a controversy or what happened during a crime so that the people involved ca n't sue them .

A seesaw ( also known as a teeter-totter ) is a long , narrow board which is fixed in the middle , a little way above the ground . When one end of the seesaw goes up the other goes down . Children often like to play on seesaws . Two children sit on the seesaw , one at each end . The child who is down pushes the ground with his feet so that he goes up and his friend goes down . Then the friend pushes up so the first child goes down . They continue to go back and forth until they are ready to stop playing on the seesaw . It works best with two children who are about the same size , or else the heavy person will make his end stay down . On some seesaws there is room for two or three children on each end . There is a handle for each child to hold on to so that they do not fall off . In mechanics ( a kind of physics ) anything that is balanced in the middle and goes up and down like a seesaw might be described as something that `` seesaws '' .

Army ant ( or legionary ant or `` Marabunta '' ) means over 200 ant species . They are called army ants due to their aggressive predatory groups looking for food , known as `` raids '' , in which many ants look for food at the same time in one place , attacking other animals en masse . Most ant species make homes where they always live . Army ants do not . They keep moving . All army ant species are members of the ant family , Formicidae , but there are several kinds that have evolved on their own the same behavior . This is called `` legionary behavior '' , and is convergent evolution . Before , `` army ant '' meant ants from 5 different ant subfamilies : in two of these subfamilies , the Ponerinae and Myrmicinae , it is only a few species that show legionary behavior ; in the other three subfamilies , Ecitoninae , Dorylinae , and Leptanillinae , all of the species are legionary . Now , another subfamily Leptanilloidinae , is called army ants . A 2003 study of thirty species ( by Sean Brady of Cornell University ) shows that the ecitonine and doryline army ants evolved from one group in the mid-Cretaceous period in Gondwana , and so the two subfamilies are now one called Ecitoninae , but not everyone says this .

A shoulder rest is something which is used by people who play the violin or the viola . It may be made of wood , aluminium , carbon fiber or plastic . Usually , the shoulder rest attaches to the edge of the violin with `` feet '' padded with rubber tubing or made of soft plastic . The purpose of a shoulder rest is to help the player to be comfortable holding the violin , which is held between the chin and the shoulder . Not all players use a shoulder rest . Many violinists prefer just to put a piece of cloth or some other form of padding on their shoulder . Whether a player uses a shoulder rest may depend on whether he or she has a long neck , and whether he is wearing clothes made with thick or thin material . It is important that the player can shift his left hand easily and freely to play in the higher positions without being afraid that he will drop the instrument , and without feeling the need to squeeze the instrument between his chin and shoulder as this will make the muscles in his neck very tight . The shoulder rest must not be confused with the chinrest , which is the bit on which the player rests his chin .

In cryptography , an SP-network , or substitution-permutation network ( SPN ) , is a series of linked mathematical operations used in block cipher algorithms such as AES . These networks consist of S-boxes and P-boxes that transform blocks of input bits into output bits . S-boxes substitute or transform input bits into output bits . A good S-box will have the property that changing one input bit will change about half of the output bits . It will also have the property that each output bit will depend on every input bit . P-boxes permute or rearrange bits across S-box inputs . In addition , at each round the key is combined using some group operation , typically XOR .

The PropÃ dia is the first of three parts of the Encyclopaedia Britannica , , the other two being the 12-volume MicropÃ dia and the 17-volume MacropÃ dia . The PropÃ dia is supposed to be a book that organizes the things in the Britannica , and a guideline to the index of the other two parts . It was introduced in 1974 with the 15th edition of the encyclopedia to replace the index , but when many people complained , Britannica put the index back in two books in 1985 . The core of the PropÃ dia is its Outline of Knowledge , which is supposed to give people a classification of what we know , but the PropÃ dia also has some parts listing the staff members , advisors and contributors to all three parts of the Britannica . The Propaedia can be used by a student who wants to know what there is to know , before even finding out about it . Once the student finds out what he needs to know , he will then find out about the thing itself . The Outline has ten Parts , each with an essay to introduce the part . Below is the table of the ten parts .

The Michelson interferometer is the tool used for optical interferometry . It was invented by Albert Abraham Michelson , famous for proving the inexistence of luminiferous aether in the Michelson-Morley experiment . There are two mirrors in the interferometer , one fixed and the other is movable through a micrometer . There is also a beam splitter that separates the laser or light beam and a screen that shows the interference pattern . A wide laser or light beam is first shot at the beam splitter . Reflection takes place as the beam hits the beam splitter , part of it reflects towards mirror 1 while the rest towards mirror 2 . The two beams again reflect off mirror 1 and 2 and travel back to the beam splitter , the two beams that goes through the beam splitter will combine and form an interference pattern at the screen . The interference pattern will appear as bands and each band represents 2 path length difference or 1 wavelength , that is because the crest of wave 1 has caught up with the crest of wave 2 ( or the other way around ) , causing a constructive interference . If given the change in distance of the movable mirror and number of bands on the screen , we can easily calculate the wavelength of the light source .

This is a list of the world 's best-selling albums . The criteria are that the figure must have been published by a reliable source and the album must have sold at least 20 million copies worldwide . Most albums have different estimates of sales . In this list , the highest sales reported for an album is added to the list . Groupings are based on different sales benchmarks . The highest benchmark is for claims of at least 100 million copies , and the lowest are for claims of 20 â `` 29 million copies . Albums are listed in order of number of copies sold and by the artist 's first name .

Tritheism is the belief that there are three distinct , powerful gods , who form a triad . Generally three gods are believed to have separate powers and separate supreme beings or spheres of influence but working together . In this respect tritheism differs from dualism , which typically envisages two opposed Divine powers in conflict with one another . Ironically , there is no group that claims to believe in or teach tritheism ; the term is solely used as an accusation against others , somewhat similar to the usage of the word cult , in accusing a group of holding an alternate or distorted view of the Christian doctrine of Trinity . The main branches consider tritheism heretical .

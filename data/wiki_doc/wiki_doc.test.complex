The pygmy possums are a family of small possums that together form the marsupial family Burramyidae . There are five extant species of pygmy possum , grouped into two genera . Four of the species are endemic to Australia , with one species also co-occurring in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia . Pygmy possums range in length from about 5 t long , and usually weigh between 10 t. They are nocturnal and omnivorous , living on a diet of invertebrates , fruit , seed , nectar and pollen . They are excellent climbers , due in part to their possession of a prehensile tail . Although they can not glide like some other species of possum , some species are able to leap a long distance . Conservation International ( CI ) and the Indonesia Institute of Science ( LIPI ) reported on the possible discovery of a new species of Cercartetus pygmy possum upon visit to the Foja Mountains in June 2007 . There are two genera of pygmy possums : Burramys and Cercartetus . Burramys contains only one extant species , the Mountain Pygmy Possum , Burramys parvus . As currently understood , Cercartetus consists of four extant species . â = extinct species .

Nasi lemak is a dish sold in Malaysia , Brunei , Singapore , Riau Islands and Southern Thailand . The dish is considered the national dish and a national heritage of Malaysia . It is not to be confused with Nasi Dagang sold on the east coast of Malaysia or Terengganu and Kelantan although both dishes can usually be found sold side by side for breakfast . However , because of the Nasi Lemak 's versatility in being able to be served in a variety of manners , it is now served and eaten any time of the day . There is a similar dish in Indonesia called nasi uduk . With roots in Malay culture , its name is a Malay word that literally means ` fatty rice ' . The name is derived from the cooking process whereby rice is soaked in coconut cream and then the mixture steamed . Sometimes knotted screwpine ( pandan ) leaves are thrown into the rice while steaming to give it more fragrance . Spices such as ginger and occasionally herbs like lemon grass may be added for additional fragrance . Traditionally , this comes as a platter of food wrapped in banana leaf , with cucumber slices , small dried anchovies ( ikan bilis ) , roasted peanuts , hard boiled egg , and hot spicy sauce ( sambal ) at its core . As a more substantial meal , nasi lemak can also come with a variety of other accompaniments such as chicken , cuttlefish , cockle , stir fried water convolvulus ( kangkong ) , pickled vegetables ( achar ) , beef rendang ( beef stewed in coconut milk and spices ) or paru ( beef lungs ) . Traditionally most of these accompaniments are spicy in nature . Nasi Lemak is widely eaten in Singapore and Malaysia , even as a dish served in Malaysian schools . Commonly a breakfast dish in both countries , it is normally sold at hawker food centres in Singapore and roadside stalls in Malaysia . It often comes packed in newspaper , brown paper , or banana leaf . However , there are restaurants which serve it on a plate as noon or evening meals , making it possible for the dish to be eaten all day . Nasi lemak kukus which means steam nasi lemak is another name given to nasi lemak served with steamed rice . In Singapore and Malaysia , Nasi Lemak comes in various versions as they are prepared by different chefs in different cultures . Hotels have nasi lemak on their menu with elaborate dishes , such as beef rendang and the addition of other seafood . Hawker centres in Singapore usually wrap them in banana leaves to enhance the flavor . Roadside stalls sell them ready packed , known as `` Nasi Lemak Bungkus '' , meaning `` Wrapped Nasi Lemak '' , with minimal additions that costs between RM 1 â `` 7 per pack . There are Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indian versions , and Singaporean Malay and Chinese versions . The Malaysian Indian version is similar to the original version . However , many Malaysian Indians are Hindus , and do not eat beef . Therefore , beef is not included while preparing the Malaysian Indian version of nasi lemak . Although it is not common to see Malaysian Chinese stalls and restaurants selling nasi lemak , there is a non-halal version that contains pork sold in towns and cities such as Malacca and certain parts of Kuala Lumpur . Some Malaysian Chinese hawkers are known to make minced pork sambal . Similar to Malaysian version with a kind of small fish called ikan tamban , usually fried with sambal and very crispy , whole fish is edible . This traditional favorite offers ikan bilis ( the Malay version of anchovies ) and nuts , fried fish , cucumber and sometimes an egg . Retaining the familiar aroma of pandan leaves , the Chinese variation comes with a variety of sides that includes deep fried drumstick , chicken franks , fish cake , curried vegetables and luncheon meat . In certain parts of Kuala Lumpur , some Malaysian Chinese and Malay hawkers also offer vegetarian nasi lemak in which the dried anchovies is substituted with vegetarian mock anchovies .

Under this system , each ballot paper contains a different permutation of candidates so each candidate has a certain proportion of times at every position in their party 's column , therefore equally dispersing the donkey votes and nullifying their impact on the result . Mariano JosÃ MarÃ a Bernardo Fortuny y Marsal ( June 11 , 1838 -- November 21 , 1874 ) was a Spanish painter . His brief career encompassed both the Romantic fascination with Orientalist themes , and a prescient loosening of brush-stroke and color . He was born in Reus , a town near Tarragona in the autonomous community of Catalonia in Spain . His father died when Mariano was an infant , and his mother by the time he was 12 . Thus , Mariano was raised by his grandfather , a cabinet-maker who taught him to make wax figurines . At the age of 9 , at a public competition in his town a local patron , Domingo Soberno , encouraged further study . At the age of 14 years he moved to Barcelona with his grandfather . A sculptor , Domingo Taleru , secured him a pension to allow him to attend the Academy of Barcelona . There he studied for four years under Claudio Lorenzale , and in March 1857 he gained a scholarship that entitled him to two years of studies in Rome starting in 1858 . There he studied drawing and grand manner styles . In 1859 , he was called by the Spanish government to depict the campaigns of the Spanish-Moroccan War . The expedition lasted for only about six months , and he returned to Spain in the summer of 1860 . Since the days of VelÃ zquez , there had been a tradition in Spain of memorializing battles and victories in paint ; and on the basis of his experiences , Fortuny was commissioned by the city of Barcelona to paint a large canvas diorama of the capture of the camps of Muley-el-Abbas and Muley-el-Hamed by the Spanish army . He began his composition of The battle of Tetuan on a canvas fifteen metres long ; but though he worked on and off on it during the next decade , he never finished it . The greater influence of this travel on Fortuny was his subsequent fascination with the exotic themes of the world of Morocco , painting both individuals and imagined court scenes . He visited Paris in 1868 and shortly afterwards married Cecilia de Madrazo , the daughter of Federico de Madrazo , who would become curator of the Prado Museum in Madrid . Together , they had a son , Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo , who became a well-known fashion and tapestry designer . Another visit to Paris in 1870 was followed by a two years ' stay at Granada , but then he returned to Rome , where he died somewhat suddenly on November 21 , 1874 from an attack of tertian ague , or malaria , contracted while painting in the open air at Naples and Portici in the summer of 1874 . Fortuny paintings are colorful , with a vivacious iridescent brushstroke , that at times recalls the softness of Rococo painting but also anticipates impressionist brushwork , Fortuny 's recollection of Morocco is not a costume ball , but a fierce , realistic portrait which includes bare-chested warriors . Richard Muther states : `` his marvellously sensitive eye â discerned the stalls of Moorish carpet-sellers , with little figures swarming , and the rich display of woven stuffs of the East ; the weary attitude of old Arabs sitting in the sun ; the sombre , brooding faces of strange snake-charmers and magicians . This is no Parisian Eastâ every one here speaks Arabic '' . Fortuny often painted scenes where contemporary life had still not shaken off the epaulets and decorations of ancient traditions such as the â â Burial of a matadorâ â and couples signing marriage contracts ( La Vicaria ) . Each has the dazzle of bric-a-brac ornament , but as in his painting of the â â Judgement of the modelâ â , that painterly decorative air of Rococo and Romanticism was fading into academicism and left to confront the naked reality of the represented object .
Villers-Cotter Ã ts is a commune in the Aisne department in Picardy in northern France . The inhabitants are called Cottereziens . It is located 80 k NE of Paris via the RN2 facing Laon . Its nickname Petite villa sur la cÃ te de Retz means Little villa by the coast of Retz , as the town is situated next to the Retz forest which covers 130 k of land . Villers-Cotter Ã ts is famous because of the Ordinance of Villers-Cotter Ã ts 1539 signed by king Francis I of France ( ` FranÃ ois Ier ' ) which made French the official language in the kingdom instead of regional languages like Occitan and also Latin . In 1914 , the British Expeditionary Force fought a rearguard action here during the Retreat from Mons . On 1 September , the British 4th ( Guards ) Brigade who were covering the withdrawal of 2nd Division , came into contact with the leading units of the German III Corps on the edge of woodland near Villers-Cotter Ã ts . The brigade lost more than 300 men in the encounter , but were able to break away and continue the withdrawal . It was the birthplace of Alexandre Dumas , pÃ re ( 1802 â `` 1870 ) , novelist . The town was the start of Stage 4 in the 2007 Tour de France . The local chÃ cents teau , known as ChÃ cents teau de NoÃ 1\/4 e was built in the 16th century for Francis I and later got 18th century rÃ gence decoration by Gilles-Marie Oppenordt . The original chÃ cents teau was built around 950 AD and was burnt to the ground twice before being rebuilt out of stone in the early 12th century . The front entrance is the only original remaining structure , which is listed with the Historic Monument Registry at the Beaux Arts . The chÃ cents teau was purchased from the de NoÃ 1\/4 e family by Francis I to house his mistress Anne de Pissleux . The current owner is the Pepinieres du Valois , an agricultural venture .

In anatomy , the urethra ( from Greek Î á 1\/2 Ï Î Î Ï Î - ourethra ) is a tube that connects the urinary bladder to the genitals for removal out of the body . In males , the urethra travels through the penis , and carries semen as well as urine . In females , the urethra is shorter and emerges above the vaginal opening . The external urethral sphincter is a striated muscle that allows voluntary control over urination . In the human female , the urethra is about 1.5 â long and exits the body between the clitoris and the vagina , extending from the internal to the external urethral orifice . It is placed behind the symphysis pubis , embedded in the anterior wall of the vagina , and its direction is obliquely downward and forward ; it is slightly curved with the concavity directed forward . Its lining is composed of stratified squamous epithelium , which becomes transitional near the bladder . The urethra consists of three coats : muscular , erectile , and mucous , the muscular layer being a continuation of that of the bladder . Between the superior and inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm , the female urethra is surrounded by the Sphincter urethae ( urethral sphincter ) . Somatic ( conscious ) innervation of the external urethral sphincter is supplied by the pudendal nerve . The uro-genital sinus may be divided into three component parts . The first of these is the cranial portion which is continuous with the allantois and forms the bladder proper . The pelvic part of the sinus forms the prostatic urethra and epithelium as well as the membranous urethra and bulbo urethral glands in the male and the membranous urethra and part of the vagina in females . The area above and on both sides of the female urethra is thought by some to be sexually sensitive and is sometimes referred to as the VAKI U-spot or urethral erogenous zone . In the human male , the urethra is about 8 i long and opens at the end of the penis . The urethra provides an exit for urine as well as semen during ejaculation . The length of a male 's urethra , and the fact it contains a prominent bend , makes catheterization more difficult . The integrity of the urethra can be determined by a procedure known as retrograde urethrogram . The epithelium of the urethra starts off as transitional cells as it exits the bladder . Further along the urethra there are stratified columnar cells , then stratified squamous cells near the external urethral orifice . There are small mucus-secreting urethral glands , that help protect the epithelium from the corrosive urine . The female urethra is about 4 cm in length . There is inadequate data for the typical length of the male urethra , however a study of 109 men showed an average length of 22.3 cm ( SD = 2.4 cm ) , ranging from 15 cm to 29 cm . The male urethra is the conduit for semen during sexual intercourse . It also serves as a passage for urine to flow . Urine typically contains epithelial cells shed from the urinary tract . Urine cytology evaluates this urinary sediment for the presence of cancerous cells from the lining of the urinary tract , and it is a convenient noninvasive technique for follow-up analysis of patients treated for urinary tract cancers . For this process , urine must be collected in a reliable fashion , and if urine samples are inadequate , the urinary tract can be assessed via instrumentation . In urine cytology , collected urine is examined microscopically . One limitation , however , is the inability to definitively identify low-grade cancer cells and urine cytology is used mostly to identify high-grade tumors .
Marcus Nathan Bent ( born 19 May 1978 ) is an English football striker who plays for Sheffield United on loan from Birmingham City . A former England under-21 international , the journeyman striker has played for fourteen different clubs , playing over 450 league games and scoring almost 100 goals in the process . He has played Premier League football for Crystal Palace , Blackburn Rovers , Ipswich Town , Leicester City , Everton , Charlton Athletic , Wigan Athletic and Wolverhampton Wanderers . Bent was born in Hammersmith , London , to parents of Jamaican origin . He attended St Paul 's College in Sunbury-on-Thames . Bent graduated through the Brentford youth ranks , usually playing as a forward . He played his first senior game at Bury on 17 August 1996 , and scored his first senior goal on 10 September the same year , helping Brentford achieve a 3 â `` 2 victory over Blackpool . He was almost ever-present in a successful season that saw Brentford reach the Football League Second Division play-offs in May 1997 , only to be beaten by Crewe Alexandra . In January 1998 , he moved to Crystal Palace for Â # 300,000 . He scored 5 goals for the South London side . Almost exactly a year later , in 1999 , he went on to become a Port Vale player for Â # 375,000 , but stayed only nine months , scoring once against Grimsby Town . Bent was then released by Port Vale and joined Sheffield United . An impressive 20 goals in 48 league appearances for Sheffield United earned Bent a transfer to promotion chasing Blackburn Rovers for a fee of Â # 2,050,000 in November 2000 . Bent would go on to play Premier League football for Blackburn before being sold to Ipswich Town for Â # 3 million in November 2001 . Bent was named Premier League Player of the Month for January 2002 , the only Ipswich player ever to receive the honor . Despite Bent scoring 9 times in 22 league starts Ipswich were relegated from the Premiership at the end of the 2001-02 season . He stayed at Ipswich for another season before joining newly promoted Leicester City for the 2003 â `` 04 However he again suffered relegation as Leicester made an instant return to the Football League . Before the start of the 2004 â `` 05 season , Bent transferred to Everton for a fee of Â # 450,000 . He became a regular starter at Everton in the lone center forward role , but only managed seven goals , which were key in securing draws away to Southampton and at home to Aston Villa , as well as decisive goals against Middlesbrough and Manchester City . Bent became a more peripheral figure in his second season at Everton where he was regularly used as back up for new signing James Beattie in January 2006 , it was announced that Bent had signed for Charlton Athletic in a deal worth Â # 2.3 million . Everton manager David Moyes said `` It represents a good profit for us for an average player '' . Bent had only cost the Toffees Â # 450,000 from Ipswich Town . He scored on his debut as a substitute against league champions Chelsea in a 1 â `` 1 draw but was again a member of a relegated side as Charlton suffered relegation in May 2007 . He had been stuck on 99 career goals since November 2006 until he netted in Charlton 's first game of the 2007 â `` 08 season against Scunthorpe in August 2007 . Bent joined Wigan Athletic on 31 August 2007 on `` deadline day '' on a season long loan move . Bent scored a hat-trick , his first in the Premier League , against Blackburn Rovers in a 5 â `` 3 win , on 15 December 2007 . At the end of the season , Wigan manager Steve Bruce chose not to make the deal permanent , feeling Bent was too similar in style to Emile Heskey . He returned to Charlton where he was placed on the transfer list . Bent signed a three-year deal for Birmingham City on 16 July 2008 for a fee in excess of Â # 1 million after rejecting the opportunity to join Cardiff City . and helped the club to promotion to the Premier League but did not feature for them at the higher level . Instead , he became Gordon Strachan 's first signing for Middlesbrough when he joined on a two-month loan deal on 30 October 2009 , later extended to 16 January 2010 . He spent the final three months of the 2009 â `` 10 season on loan at a second Championship club , Queens Park Rangers , whom he joined in February 2010 .

He has since been involved with model Danielle Lloyd and actress Gemma Atkinson , to whom he was briefly engaged .
A cart is a vehicle or designed for transport , using two wheels and normally pulled by one or a pair of draught animals . A handcart is pulled or pushed by one or more people . It is different from a dray or wagon , which is a heavy transport vehicle with four wheels and normally at least two horses , which in turn is different from a carriage , which is used exclusively for transporting humans . The restriction of `` carts '' to two wheels has become less strictly observed since they were commonly horse-drawn , particularly for those pushed by people . The draught animals used for carts may be horses or ponies , mules , oxen , water buffalo or donkeys , or even smaller animals such as goats or large dogs . Carts have been mentioned in literature as far back as the second millennium B.C. . The Indian sacred book Rigveda states that men and women are as equal as two wheels of a cart . Hand-carts pushed by humans have been used around the world . In the 19th century , for instance , some Mormons traveling across the plains of the United States between 1856 and 1860 used handcarts . Carts were often used for judicial punishments , both to transport the condemned -- a public humiliation in itself ( in Ancient Rome defeated leaders were often carried in the victorious general 's triumph ) -- and even , in England until its substitution by the whipping post under Queen Elizabeth I , to tie the condemned to the cart-tail and administer him or her a public whipping . Larger carts may be drawn by animals , such as horses , mules , or oxen . They have been in continuous use since the invention of the wheel , in the 5th millennium BC . Carts may be named for the animal that pulls them , such as horsecart or oxcart . In modern times , horsecarts are used in competition while draft horse showing . A dogcart , however , is usually a cart designed to carry hunting dogs : an open cart with two cross-seats back to back ; the dogs could be penned between the rear-facing seat and the back end . The term '' cart '' ( synonymous in this sense with chair ) is also used for various kinds of lightweight , two-wheeled carriages , some of them sprung carts ( or spring carts ) , especially those used as open pleasure or sporting vehicles . They could be drawn by a horse , pony or dog . Examples include : The builder of a cart may be known as a cartwright ; the surname `` Carter '' also derives from the occupation of transporting goods by cart or wagon . Carts have many different shapes , but the basic idea of transporting material ( or maintaining a collection of materials in a portable fashion ) remains . Carts may have a pair of shafts , one along each side of the draught animal that supports the forward-balanced load in the cart . The shafts are supported by a saddle on the horse . Alternatively ( and normally where the animals are oxen or buffalo ) , the cart may have a single pole between a pair of animals . The draught traces attach to the axle of the vehicle or to the shafts . The traces are attached to a collar ( on horses ) , to a yoke ( on other heavy draught animals ) or to a harness on dogs or other light animals . Traces are made from a range of materials depending on the load and frequency of use . Heavy draught traces are made from iron or steel chain . Lighter traces are often leather and sometimes hemp rope , but plaited horse-hair and other similar decorative materials can be used . The dray is often associated with the transport of barrels , particularly of beer . Of the cart types not animal-drawn , perhaps the most common example today is the shopping cart ( British English : shopping trolley ) , which has also come to have a metaphorical meaning in relation to online purchases ( here , British English uses the metaphor of the shopping basket ) . Shopping carts first made their appearance in Oklahoma City in 1937 . In golf , both manual push or pull and electric golf trolleys are designed to carry a golfers bag , clubs and other equipment . Also , the golf cart , car , or buggy , is a powered vehicle that carries golfers and their equipment around a golf course faster and with less effort than walking . A Porter 's trolley is a type of small , hand-propelled wheeled platform . This can also be called a baggage cart . since the 13th century . Autocarts are a type of small , hand-propelled wheeled utility carts having a pivoting base for collapsible storage in vehicles . They eliminate the need for plastic or paper shopping bags and are also used by tradespersons to carry tools , equipment or supplies . A soap-box cart ( also known as a Billy Cart , Go-Cart , Trolley etc. ) is a popular children 's construction project on wheels , usually pedaled , but also intended for a test race .
Westmorland ( ; formerly also spelt Westmoreland , an even older spelling is Westmerland or Westmereland ) is an area of North West England and one of the 39 historic counties of England . It formed an administrative county from 1889 to 1974 , after which the entirety of the county was absorbed into the new county of Cumbria . At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 parts of the county were considered to either form part of Yorkshire or be within the separate kingdom of Scotland , having historically been associated with the Kingdom of Strathclyde . The Normans conquered the area that is now Cumbria in 1092 during the reign of William II and created the baronies of Kendal and Westmorland which were originally distinct jurisdictions with separate sheriffs , but were formed into a single county of Westmorland in 1226\/7 . Before 1226 the Barony of Kendal was connected to the Earldom or Honour of Lancaster while that of Westmorland was part of the Earldom of Carlisle . The historic county boundaries are with Cumberland to the north , County Durham and Yorkshire to the east , and Lancashire to the south and west . Windermere forms part of the western border with Lancashire north of the sands , and Ullswater part of the border with Cumberland . The highest point of the county is Helvellyn at 950m ( 3,117 ft ) . According to the 1831 census it covered an area of 485990 a. Appleby , the historic county town , formed a historic borough and was unreformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 ; although reform came later in 1885 . Kendal was reformed as a municipal borough in 1835 . Rather than being divided into hundreds , Westmorland was subdivided into two baronies of Westmorland ( or sometimes Appleby ) and Kendal . In 1889 , under the Local Government Act 1888 , a county council was created for Westmorland , taking functions from the Quarter Sessions . Westmorland did not contain any county boroughs throughout its history so the administrative county , or area under the control of the county council , was coterminous with the geographic county . The county council was based at Kendal , instead of the historic county town of Appleby-in-Westmorland . Aside from the two municipal boroughs of Kendal and Appleby , the Local Government Act 1894 divided the county into urban districts and rural districts . In 1905 a new Shap urban district was formed , while Windermere absorbed the neighbouring Bowness UD . Despite the title many of Westmorland 's urban districts eg : Lakes , Grasmere , Shap were quite rural . These divisions lasted until 1974 . According to the 1971 census , Westmorland was the second least populated administrative county in England , after Rutland . The distribution of population was as follows : In 1974 , under the Local Government Act 1972 , the county council was abolished and its former area was combined with Cumberland and parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire to form the new county of Cumbria , administered by a new Cumbria County Council . The former administrative county now forms part of the districts of South Lakeland and Eden . Since Westmorland existed before the Westmorland County Council , it is unaffected by administrative changes . Westmorland County Council was granted a coat of arms by the College of Arms in 1926 . The design of the shield referred to the two components of the county : on two red bars ( from the arms of the de Lancaster family , Barons of Kendal ) was placed a gold apple tree ( from the seal of the borough of Appleby , for the Barony of Westmorland ) . The crest above the shield was the head of a ram of the local Herdwick breed . On the ram 's forehead was a shearman 's hook , a tool used in the handling of wool . The hook was part of the insignia of the borough of Kendal , the administrative center of the county council . The southern part of the county , the former Barony of Kendal or that part of Westmorland that is part of South Lakeland , is included in the Westmorland and Lonsdale parliamentary constituency . In June 1994 , during the 1990s UK local government reform , the Local Government Commission published draft recommendations suggesting that Westmorland 's border with Yorkshire and Lancashire be restored for ceremonial purposes . The final recommendations , published in October 1994 , did not include such recommendations , apparently due to lack of expression of support for the proposal to the commission .
Recklinghausen is the northernmost city in the Ruhr-Area and the capital of the Recklinghausen district . It borders the rural MÃ 1\/4 nsterland and is characterized by large fields and farms in the north and industry in the south . Recklinghausen is the 60th-largest city in Germany and the 22nd-largest city in North Rhine-Westphalia . First mentioned in 1017 as Ricoldinchuson , in 1150 the city was the center of the surrounding Vest Recklinghausen . In 1236 , the city of Recklinghausen received town privileges . As part of the County of Vest , ownership of Recklinghausen changed several times in the 15th and 16th century , and in 1576 , the entire county was pawned to the Elector of Cologne . In 1582-83 , again in 1586 , and again in 1587 , the city was plundered by partisan armies during the Cologne War , a feud over religious parity in Electorate of Cologne and electoral influence in the Holy Roman Empire . Recklinghausen was also the site of more than 100 witchcraft trials ( 1514 â `` 1710 ) . The trial activity reached a climax twice : In the time period of 1580\/81 and again in 1588\/89 . The last person to be convicted of witchcraft was Anna Spickermann ; after spending 16 months in prison , she was sentenced to death by sword and burned afterward . Circa 1600 , the administration of the Vest Recklinghausen was divided into two parts , with the eastern part administered by Recklinghausen . The town of Recklinghausen including the parish of Recklinghausen and the parishes Ahsen , Datteln , Flaesheim , Hamm-Bossendorf , Henrichenburg , Herten , Horneburg , Oer , Suderwich , Waltrop and Westerholt . Circa 1815 , the Vest was made a BÃ 1\/4 rgermeisterei , with the town becoming the seat . In 1819 , Herten joined the Recklinghausen BÃ 1\/4 rgermeisterei , and Erkenschwick followed in 1821 . As a target of the Oil Campaign of World War II , oil production at Recklinghausen\/Forstezung was bombed by the RAF on January 15 , 1945 ; and South Recklinghausen ( Recklinghausen Sud ) was captured by the US 137th Infantry on April 1 , 1945 . Recklinghausen is home to a museum of icons , which includes more than 1,000 Orthodox works from Russia , Greece and the Balkan countries , as well as early Coptic Christian art from Egypt . The icon museum - the largest outside the Orthodox world - was founded in 1956 and reopened after renovation in February 2006 for its 50th anniversary . Recklinghausen hosts the annual Ruhrfestspiele , a cultural festival with an international reputation . Every year there is a cultural program with many national and international theatrical productions starting on 1 May . In 2008 the program included the play Speed the Plow starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Goldblum as one of the major productions . The main theatrical stage is the Ruhrfestspielhaus but other theaters in and around Recklinghausen participate . In front of the Ruhrfestpielhaus , whose refurbishment in 2001 won the German Architecture Award , there is `` Die Liegende Nr 5 '' a famous sculpture by Henry Moore . At the Lohtor in front of a memorial for the victims of World War I , there is a large sculpture made of more than 30,000 bricks by Per Kirkeby . The two major motorways crossing the area of the city are the A2 and the A43 . The city is connected to the larger waterways by the Rhein-Herne-Kanal . Recklinghausen has two railway stations . The Central Station ( Recklinghausen Hauptbahnhof ) which is connected to the national and European high speed ( Intercity ) and the South Station ( Recklinghausen SÃ 1\/4 dbahnhof ) .
A verse is formally a single line in a metrical composition , e.g. poetry . However , the word has come to represent any division or grouping of words in such a composition , which traditionally had been referred to as a stanza . The word `` verse '' is commonly used in lieu of `` poetry '' to distinguish it from prose . Where the common unit of poetry , i.e. , verse , is based on meter or rhyme the common unit of prose is purely grammatical , such as a sentence or paragraph . Rhymed verse is the most commonly used form of verse and generally has a discernable meter and an end rhyme . I felt a cleavage in my mind As if my brain had split ; I tried to match it , seam by seam , But could not make them fit . The thought behind I strove to join Unto the thought before , But sequence ravelled out of reach Like balls upon a floor . Blank verse is generally identified by a regular meter , but no end rhyme . In Mathematics , Woman leads the way : The narrow-minded pedant still believes That two and two make four ! Why , we can prove , We women-household drudges as we are - That two and two make five-or three-or seven ; Or five-and-twenty , if the case demands ! Free verse is usually defined as having no fixed meter and no end rhyme . Although free verse may include end rhyme , it commonly does not . I remember the days of dreamings , From where in the world so much knowledges , And thoughts of wonderful and funs . But however life walks ahead , And ideas are unavailing aloud , When around so many flies . Concealed after the masks of sorrow . As though all of us knew it And we read many books , At life and lives to our , And in a head as though by porridge , the ideas of illness Convolved to our . Now , we are free on age , And not closing age , you Remain man by itself , not think about plennosti to it , Go freedom rather . Partake the fruit of freedom rather ,
On January 20 , 2006 , an explosion occurred in the underground Carola-Agustina copper mine in CopiapÃ , Chile , after two trucks collided , covering the only escape route for the miners inside the mine . The explosion caused two deaths and two injuries . 70 miners were trapped . Shortly after the explosion occurred , workers at the nearby mine , `` Punta de Cobre '' , began digging a tunnel towards the Carola-Agustina mine to assist in rescuing the trapped miners . Rescue efforts lasted seven hours , and the trapped miners were rescued alive .
The 1924 Summer Olympics , officially known as the Games of the VIII Olympiad , were an international multi-sport event which was celebrated in 1924 in Paris , France . The home city of Pierre de Coubertin , founder of the modern games , was selected over bids of Amsterdam , Los Angeles , Rio de Janeiro , and Rome , though Paris had also hosted the 1900 Games . With total receipts at 5,496,610 â # , the Olympics resulted in a hefty loss despite crowds that reached 60,000 people at a time . A total of 44 nations were represented at the 1924 Games . Germany was still absent , having not been invited by the Organizing Committee . Ecuador , Haiti , Ireland , Lithuania , the Philippines , Mexico and Uruguay attended the Olympic Games for the first time . Latvia and Poland attended the Summer Olympic Games for the first time ( having both appeared earlier at the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix ) . These are the top ten nations that won medals at these Games .

Commelinales is the botanical name of an order of flowering plants . It 's considered that the Commelinales together with Zingiberales evolved in the Late Cretaceous around 80 millions of years ago . Two of the best-known genera in the order are Commelina and Tradescantia . In the APG II system , of 2003 , the order is placed in the clade commelinids , in the monocots , and comprises the families Commelinaceae ( the spiderwort family , about 650 species ) , Haemodoraceae ( about 75 species of mostly southern hemisphere plants ) , Hanguanaceae ( two species of tropical Asian plants ) , Philydraceae ( five species of tropical Asian plants ) and Pontederiaceae ( about three dozen species of aquatic plants including water hyacinth ) . This represents a change from the APG system , of 1998 , which had not included family Hanguanaceae in this order . In the Cronquist system , of 1981 , this order was placed in subclass Commelinidae of class Liliopsida and copmrised the families Commelinaceae , Mayacaceae , Rapateaceae and Xyridaceae .

Larchwood is a city in Lyon County , Iowa , United States . The population was 788 at the 2000 census . Its main employer is the Novartis Animal Vaccines plant located 3 miles ( 5 km ) southwest of the city . Larchwood is located at ( 43.454351 , -96.434897 ) . According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 1.0 square miles ( 2.5 kmÂ ) , all of it land . Larchwood was founded about 1872 by a group of McLean County , Illinois land developers Jesse W. Fell ( 10 November 1808 â `` 25 February 1887 ) and Charles W. Holder ( 25 September 1819 â `` 10 April 1900 ) . Fell was born in Pennsylvania , had settled in Bloomington , Illinois , in 1831 and had played an active role in founding many Illinois towns including Clinton , Normal , Pontiac , and Towanda . He was a close friend of Abraham Lincoln , and with his brother Kersey Fell had persuaded Lincoln to write his famous autography . He was nationally known for his love of trees . Holder was a partner in many of Fellâ s projects including Towanda and Normal . Holder , Illinois was named in his honor . In the summer of 1869 Fell traveled to northwestern Iowa and selected a tract of about forty sections , more than 25000 a of land . Fell wrote , â I have never beheld such a large body of surpassingly beautiful prairie as is here to be found . There is absolutely no waste of land , and scarce a quarter of a section not affording an admirable building site . â Holder then entered the land . Larchwood was established at the center of their holdings . Fell frequently visited the site and in May 0f 1873 personally supervised the planting of some 100,000 saplings and tree cuttings . The town did not grow as rapidly as expected and in 1881 the development was sold to an Englishman Richard Sykes . As of the census of 2000 , there were 788 people , 326 households , and 234 families residing in the city . The population density was 812.1 people per square mile ( 313.7 \/ kmÂ ) . There were 344 housing units at an average density of 354.5 \/ sq mi ( 136.9 \/ kmÂ ) . The racial makeup of the city was 98.60 % White , 0.13 % Native American , 0.51 % Asian , and 0.76 % from two or more races . There were 326 households out of which 33.7 % had children under the age of 18 living with them , 62.6 % were married couples living together , 5.8 % had a female householder with no husband present , and 28.2 % were non-families . 26.4 % of all households were made up of individuals and 15.3 % had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older . The average household size was 2.41 and the average family size was 2.91 . In the city the population was spread out with 24.2 % under the age of 18 , 10.0 % from 18 to 24 , 26.5 % from 25 to 44 , 20.6 % from 45 to 64 , and 18.7 % who were 65 years of age or older . The median age was 38 years . For every 100 females there were 95.0 males . For every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 92.6 males . The median income for a household in the city was $ 42,250 , and the median income for a family was $ 48,125 . Males had a median income of $ 30,938 versus $ 21,164 for females . The per capita income for the city was $ 21,092 . About 0.8 % of families and 2.0 % of the population were below the poverty line , including 0.5 % of those under age 18 and 8.6 % of those age 65 or over . In July 2008 , Kehl Management and Lyon County Economic Development came to an to propose a 200 a casino and golf resort about four miles ( 6 km ) northwest of Larchwood , Iowa at the South Dakota border , about a mile southwest of Benclare . The proposal was approved by Lyon county voters in Sept 2008 . In July 2009 the South Dakota legislature voted to allow a casino in Sioux Falls . This was seen as an attempt to block the Larchwood casino by creating doubt about the viability of the project .
Brion is a commune in the Ain department in eastern France . The name comes from the Latin word Bria meaning fortress , and it is home to a ruined castle .

Calcium phosphate is the name given to a family of minerals containing calcium ions ( Ca2 + ) together with orthophosphates ( PO43 - ) , metaphosphates or pyrophosphates ( P2O74 - ) and occasionally hydrogen or hydroxide ions . It is the principal form of calcium found in bovine milk . Seventy percent of bone is made up of hydroxyapatite , a calcium phosphate mineral ( known as bone mineral ) . Tooth enamel is composed of almost ninety percent hydroxyapatite . Unlike most other compounds calcium phosphate is increasingly insoluble at higher temperatures . Thus heating causes precipitation . It is used in the production of phosphoric acid and fertilizers , for example in the Odda process . Overuse of certain forms of calcium phosphate can lead to nutrient-containing surface runoff and subsequent adverse effects upon receiving waters such as algal blooms and eutrophication . Calcium phosphate is used in baking as a raising agent , with E number E341 . It is also used in cheese products . Tricalcium phosphate is also used as a nutritional supplement and occurs naturally in cow milk , although the most common and economical forms for supplementation are calcium carbonate ( which should be taken with food ) and calcium citrate ( which can be taken without food ) . Hydroxyapatite ( e.g. calcium hydrogen phosphate ) as a food supplement has not been currently studied well , so its usage as a supplement is discouraged . It is used in a variety of dental products for remineralization and as a diluent in some medications where it will give the tablet a gray color in the absence of additional coloring agents . Another practical application of the compound is its use in gene transfection of cells . It is not too well understood , but the calcium phosphate precipitate DNA and form a complex that is thought to help the DNA enter the cell . In addition to the above , of the compounds occurring in the CaO-H2O-P4O10 phase diagram , Ca4P2O9 ( probably Ca3 ( PO4 ) 2 .
Myoglobin is an iron - and oxygen-binding protein found in the muscle tissue of vertebrates in general and in almost all mammals . It is related to hemoglobin , which is the iron - and oxygen-binding protein in blood , specifically in the red blood cells . The only time myoglobin is found in the bloodstream is when it is released following muscle injury . It is an abnormal finding , and can be diagnostically relevant when found in blood . Myoglobin ( abbreviated Mb ) is a single-chain globular protein of 153 or 154 amino acids , containing a heme ( iron-containing porphyrin ) prosthetic group in the center around which the remaining apoprotein folds . It has eight alpha helices and a hydrophobic core . It has a molecular weight of 16,700 daltons , and is the primary oxygen-carrying pigment of muscle tissues . Unlike the blood-borne hemoglobin , to which it is structurally related , this protein does not exhibit cooperative binding of oxygen , since positive cooperativity is a property of multimeric\/oligomeric proteins only . Instead , the binding of oxygen by myoglobin is unaffected by the oxygen pressure in the surrounding tissue . Myoglobin is often cited as having an `` instant binding tenacity '' to oxygen given its hyperbolic oxygen dissociation curve . High concentrations of myoglobin in muscle cells allow organisms to hold their breaths longer . Diving mammals such as whales and seals have muscles with particularly high myoglobin abundance . Myoglobin was the first protein to have its three-dimensional structure revealed . In 1958 , John Kendrew and associates successfully determined the structure of myoglobin by high-resolution X-ray crystallography . For this discovery , John Kendrew shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Max Perutz . Despite being one of the most studied proteins in biology , its true physiological function is not yet conclusively established : mice genetically engineered to lack myoglobin are viable , but showed a 30 % reduction in cardiac systolic output . They adapted to this deficiency through hypoxic genetic mechanisms and increased vasodilation . In humans myoglobin is encoded by the MB gene . Myoglobin forms pigments responsible for making meat red . The color that meat takes is partly determined by the oxidation states of the iron atom in myoglobin and the oxygen species attached to it . When meat is in its raw state , the iron atom is in the +2 oxidation state , and is bound to a dioxygen molecule ( O2 ) . Meat cooked well done is brown because the iron atom is now in the +3 oxidation state , having lost an electron , and is now coordinated by a water molecule . Under some conditions , meat can also remain pink all through cooking , despite being heated to high temperatures . If meat has been exposed to nitrites , it will remain pink because the iron atom is bound to NO , nitric oxide ( true of , e.g. , corned beef or cured hams ) . Grilled meats can also take on a pink `` smoke ring '' that comes from the iron binding to a molecule of carbon monoxide to give metmyoglobin . Raw meat packed in a carbon monoxide atmosphere also shows this same pink `` smoke ring '' due to the same coordination chemistry . Notably , the surface of the raw meat also displays the pink color , which is usually associated in consumers ' minds with fresh meat . This artificially-induced pink color can persist in the meat for a very long time , reportedly up to one year . Hormel and Cargill are both reported to use this meat-packing process , and meat treated this way has been in the consumer market since 2003 . Myoglobin is found in Type I muscle , Type II A and Type II B , but most texts consider myoglobin not to be found in smooth muscle . Myoglobin is released from damaged muscle tissue ( rhabdomyolysis ) , which has very high concentrations of myoglobin . The released myoglobin is filtered by the kidneys but is toxic to the renal tubular epithelium and so may cause acute renal failure . Myoglobin is a sensitive marker for muscle injury , making it a potential marker for heart attack in patients with chest pain . However , elevated myoglobin has low specificity for acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) and thus CK-MB , cTnT , ECG , and clinical signs should be taken into account to make the diagnosis . Myoglobin contains a porphyrin ring with an iron center . There is a proximal histidine group attached directly to the iron center , and a distal histidine group on the opposite face , not bonded to the iron . Many functional models of myoglobin have been studied . One of the most important is that of picket fence porphyrin by James Collman . This model was used to show the importance of the distal prosthetic group . It serves three functions :
The Three Forms of Unity is a collective name for the Belgic Confession , the Canons of Dort , and the Heidelberg Catechism , which reflect the doctrinal concerns of Continental Calvinism and are accepted as official statements of doctrine by many of the Reformed churches . From 1618 to 1619 the Dutch government , on behalf of the Dutch Reformed Church , called and convened the Synod of Dort . Dutch delegates , along with twenty-seven Reformed representatives from eight other countries , met at this Synod of Dort , where they collectively summarized their views in what was called the `` Canons of Dort . '' This same Synod then added these Canons to two other documents , both of which were in common use by the Dutch Church at the time : the Heidelberg Catechism ( 1563 ) and the Belgic Confession ( 1561 ) . The forms also provide a basis upon which ecumenical efforts can proceed based on whether a body accepts the essentials laid out in these forms .
Western European Summer Time ( WEST ) is a summer daylight saving time scheme , 1 hour ahead of Coordinated Universal Time . It is used in the following places : The scheme runs from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October each year . At both the start and end of the schemes , clock changes take place at 01:00 UTC . During the winter , Greenwich Mean Time ( UTC +0 ) is used . The start and end dates of the scheme are somewhat asymmetrical in terms of daylight hours : the vernal time of year with a similar amount of daylight to late October is mid-February , well before the start of summer time . The asymmetry reflects temperature more than the length of daylight . Ireland does not observe a summer time , but rather observes Standard Time during the summer months and changes to UTC +0 for the purposes of Daylight Savings . However , as Ireland 's winter time period begins on the last Sunday in October and finishes on the last Sunday in March , the result is the same . The following countries and territories use Western European Summer Time during the summer , between 1:00 UTC on the last Sunday of March and 1:00 UTC on the last Sunday of October . The Standard Time Act 1968 stipulated that standard time is UTC +1 ( CET ) and from 1968 clocks were not turned back one hour during winter . The subsequent Standard Time ( Amendment ) Act , 1971 effectively reversed this , and from 1971 returned winter time to UTC +0 ( Western European Time ) ; it did not however change the names of the Irish summer time zone , which are still , officially , Irish Standard Time ( IST ) and Am CaighdeÃ nach na hÃ ireann ( ACÃ ) . Portugal moved to Central European Time and Central European Summer Time in 1992 , but reverted to Western European Time in 1996 after concluding that energy savings were small , it had a disturbing effect on children 's sleeping habits as it would not get dark until 22:00 or 22:30 in summer evenings with repercussions on standards of learning and school performance , and insurance companies reported a rise in the number of accidents . Starting in 1916 , the dates for the beginning and end of BST each year were mandated by the Parliament of the United Kingdom . In February 2002 , the Summer Time Order 2002 permanently changed the dates and times to match European rules for moving to and from daylight saving time . Note : Until 1 October 1916 time in all of Ireland was based on Dublin Mean Time which was GMT 25 minutes .

Venlo is a municipality and a city in the southeastern Netherlands . It is situated in the province of Limburg . In 2001 , the ( now former ) municipalities of Belfeld and Tegelen were merged into the municipality of Venlo . Tegelen was originally part of the Duchy of JÃ 1\/4 lich centuries ago , whereas Venlo has a past in the Duchy of Guelders . On 1 January 2010 , the ( now former ) municipality of Arcen en Velden , was merged into the municipality of Venlo . Roman and Celtic coins and remains of a Roman bridge across the river Meuse have been found in Venlo ; it may have been the settlement known as Sablones on the Roman road connecting Maastricht with Xanten . Blerick , on the west bank , was known as Blariacum . Documents from the 9th century mention Venlo as a trade post ; it developed into one of the more important ones in the Meuse-Rhine area , receiving city rights in 1343 , and becoming a member of the Hanseatic League in 1375 . Because of its strategic importance , the city of Venlo was besieged several times . The most significant siege was that of 1702 , carried on by Menno van Coehoorn . Consequently , Venlo was incorporated into the Generaliteitslanden of the United Provinces and later became part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands . On November 9 , 1939 , two British Intelligence Service agents were kidnapped by the Sicherheitsdienst in what became known as the Venlo Incident . The incident was used by the Nazis to link Great Britain to Georg Elser 's failed assassination of Hitler at the Burgerbraukeller two days before and to justify their later invasion of the Netherlands , a neutral country , on 10 May 1940 . Because Venlo had both a road and a rail bridge over the river Meuse ( `` Maas '' in Dutch ) the city was severely damaged during several bomb raids ( 13 October â `` 19 November 1944 ) on those bridges at the end of the war . The Allied forces needed 13 attempts to destroy the bridges to cut the German supply lines and block a retreat of the German army across the river . These failed , the retreating German troops blew up the bridges themselves in an attempt to stop the allied advance . Allied forces however eventually did not need either bridge , but entered Venlo from the east , crossing the border to liberate Venlo from inside Germany itself . About 300 people were killed due to those raids . The raids also cost Venlo a major part of its historical buildings . However , some old buildings , such as the city hall ( the ` Stadhuis ' ) and the ` RÃ mer ' house , survived the war relatively unscathed . In 2003 Venlo was awarded the title `` Greenest city of Europe '' . In 2012 it will host the Floriade . The Venlo railway station is a junction station . It provides regular connections to the Dutch cities of Eindhoven , Roermond , and Nijmegen . Furthermore , it provides regular international connections to Germany , via Kaldenkirchen ( the first stop in Germany ) and Viersen to MÃ nchengladbach . VVV-Venlo is a century-old football club that plays in De Koel Stadium . In the season 2008 â `` 2009 , VVV-Venlo won the Eerste Divisie ( Eerste Divisie ) and was promoted to the highest Dutch professional football league : the Eredivisie . By the late 1990s , drug-related nuisance had become a problem in the center of Venlo . National and municipal officials launched the Q-4 Project and Tango initiatives that , amongst other measures , included moving the town 's largest coffee shops to the outskirts , where they continue to do business in a former rest stop . This was a win-win solution , as the town was freed from disturbances and the coffee shops are now even closer to the expressways . Since Germany prohibits the sale of hashish and marihuana , German citizens cross the nearby border to purchase these substances . Venlo is connected to Germany by two motorways ( i.e. , Bundesautobahn 40 and Bundesautobahn 61 ) , which connect to DÃ 1\/4 sseldorf , Cologne , and the Ruhr area within one hour .
A pantograph is a device that collects electric current from overhead lines for electric trains or trams . The term stems from the resemblance to pantograph devices for copying writing and drawings . A flat side-pantograph was invented in 1895 at the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and in Germany in 1900 by Siemens & Halske . The familiar diamond-shaped roller pantograph was invented by John Q. Brown of the Key System shops for their commuter trains which ran between San Francisco and the East Bay section of the San Francisco Bay Area in California . They appear in photographs of the first day of service 26 October 1903 . For many decades thereafter , the same diamond shape was used by electric rail systems around the world and remains in use by some today . The pantograph was an improvement on the simple trolley pole which prevailed up to that time primarily because it allowed an electric rail vehicle to travel at higher speeds without losing contact with the catenary . The most common type of pantograph today is the so called half-pantograph ( sometimes ` Z ' - shaped ) , which has evolved to provide a more compact and responsive single-arm design at high speeds as trains get faster . The half-pantograph can be seen in use on everything from very fast trains ( such as the TGV ) to low-speed urban tram systems . The design operates with equal efficiency in either direction of motion , as demonstrated by the Swiss and Austrian railways whose newest high performance locomotives , the Re 460 and Taurus respectively , operate with them set in opposite directions . The electric transmission system for modern electric rail systems consists of an upper weight carrying wire ( known as a catenary ) from which is suspended a contact wire . The pantograph is spring loaded and pushes a contact shoe up against the contact wire to draw the electricity needed to run the train . The steel rails on the tracks act as the electrical return . As the train moves , the contact shoe slides along the wire and can set up acoustical standing waves in the wires which break the contact and degrade current collection . This means that on some systems adjacent pantographs are not permitted . Pantographs are the successor technology to trolley poles , which were widely used on early streetcar systems . Trolley pole are still used by trolleybuses , whose freedom of movement and need for a two-wire circuit makes pantographs impractical , and some streetcar networks , such as the Toronto Streetcar System , which have frequent turns sharp enough to require additional freedom of movement in their current collection to ensure unbroken contact . Pantographs with overhead wires are now the dominant form of current collection for modern electric trains because , although more expensive and fragile than a third-rail system , they allow the use of higher voltages . Pantographs are typically operated by compressed air from the vehicle 's braking system , either to raise the unit and hold it against the conductor or , when springs are used to effect the extension , to lower it . As a precaution against loss of pressure in the second case , the arm is held in the down position by a catch . For high-voltage systems , the same air supply is used to `` blow out '' the electric arc when roof-mounted circuit breakers are used . Pantographs may have either a single or a double arm . Double arm pantographs are usually heavier , requiring more power to raise and lower , but may also be more fault tolerant . For example , '' ... ( New Jersey Transit ) encountered numerous wire downings on the Northeast Corridor Branch ( New York City - Trenton , NJ ) before they decided to replace the pantographs on Arrow-III trains with a more forgiving dual arm design , possibly in 1991 ... '' On railways of the former USSR , the most widely used pantographs are those with a double arm ( `` made of two rhombs '' ) , but since the late 1990s there have been some single-arm pantographs on Russian railways . Some streetcars use double-arm pantographs , among them the Russian KTM-5 , KTM-8 , LVS-86 and many other Russian-made trams , as well as some Euro-PCC trams in Belgium . American streetcars use either trolley poles or single-arm pantographs . Most rapid transit systems are powered by a third rail , but some use pantographs , particularly ones that involve extensive above-ground running . Hybrid metro-tram or ` pre-metro ' lines whose routes include tracks on city streets or in other publicly-accessible areas , such as the MBTA Green Line , must of course use overhead wire , since a third rail would normally present too great a risk of electrocution . The only current exception to this is the new Bordeaux tram system that uses an underground system called alimentation par sol , which only applies power to segments of track that are completely covered by the tram . This system is used in the historic center of Bordeaux where an overhead wire system would cause a visual intrusion . Overhead pantographs are sometimes used as alternatives to third rails because third rails can ice over in certain winter weather conditions . The MBTA Blue Line or the Wonderland Line uses pantograph power for all of its surface route . The entire Metro system of Barcelona , Spain , uses overhead wiring and pantographs . Until 2010 the Oslo metro line 1 changed from third rail to overhead line power at FrÃ en station . Due to the many level crossings , it was deemed difficult to install a third rail on the rest of the older line 1 tracks .

A test tube , also known as a culture tube or sample tube , is a common piece of laboratory glassware consisting of a finger-like length of glass or clear plastic tubing , open at the top , usually with a rounded U-shaped bottom . A large test tube designed specifically for boiling liquids is called a boiling tube . Test tubes are available in a multitude of lengths and widths , typically from 10 to 20 mm wide and 50 to 200 mm long . The top often features a flared lip to aid pouring out the contents ; some sources consider that the presence of a lip is what distinguishes a test tube from a culture tube . Some test tubes have a flat bottom ; some are made so as to accept a ground glass stopper or a screw cap . They are often provided with a small ground glass or white glaze area near the top for labeling with a pencil . Test tubes are widely used by chemists to hold , mix , or heat small quantities of solid or liquid chemicals , especially for qualitative experiments and assays . Their round bottom and straight sides minimize mass loss when pouring , make them easier to clean , and allow convenient monitoring of the contents . The long , narrow neck slows down the spreading of vapors and gases to the environment . A test tube filled with water and upturned into a water-filled beaker is often used to capture gases , e.g. in electrolysis demonstrations . Culture tubes are often used in biology for handling and culturing all kinds of live organisms , such as molds , bacteria , seedlings , plant cuttings , etc. ; and in medicine and forensics to store samples of blood or other fluids . A test tube with a stopper is often used for temporary storage of chemical or biological samples . Test tubes are usually held in special-purpose racks , clamps , or tongs . Some racks for culture tubes are designed to hold the tubes in a nearly horizontal position , so as to maximize the surface of the culture medium inside . Test tubes are sometimes put to casual uses outside of lab environments , e.g. as flower vases or containers for spices . Test tubes for physics and chemistry are usually made of glass for better resistance to heat and corrosive chemicals and longer life . Tubes made from expansion-resistant glasses , such as borosilicate glass , can be placed directly over a Bunsen burner flame . Culture tubes for biology are usually made of clear plastic ( such as polystyrene or polypropylene ) by injection molding and are often discarded after use . Test tubes may come with prepared contents . For example , a blue top tube is a test tube of 5 ml containing sodium citrate as an anticoagulant , used to collect specimens for coagulation screens and testing for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase .

Tenkodogo is the capital city of Boulgou Province and Centre-Est Region in Burkina Faso with a population of 40,839 ( 2006 ) . Tenkodogo was the center of a city state of the Mossi Empire that dates back to 1120 . The name Tenkodogo is derived from the Moore words tenga , meaning land and kodogo , meaning old . The city was said to be founded by Ouedraogo , ( son of Ghanaian princess Yennenga ) , the founder of the Mossi empire who landed in the area . Of his three sons , Diaba Lompo headed east to lay the foundations of Gourmanche , Rawa went north to found Zandoma but his youngest son Zoungrana stayed to assume the mantle of the town . According to tradition , there is a triple fork about 50km from Tenkodogo symbolising the three paths . Tenkodogo Naba is considered to most important of the Mossi kings of the town . While the political status of Tenkodogo was somewhat overshadowed by Zoungrana , in the 19th century it became an important rendezvous point for foreign powers discussing the French influence in Burkina Faso . After ousting Moro Naba from Ouagadougou , the French had designs on Tenkodogo but faced stiff opposition from the British captain Donald Stewart who had traveled up from Kumasi in present day Ghana to represent his country on appeal of the fleeing Naba Wobgo who had been usurped by the French in the capital . Important discussions occurred between the French and the British on February 7 , 1897 . The discussion rather than being heated was said to be highly amicable . The French lieutenant Chanoine wrote in October 1897 that `` The representative of England received us with great courtesy and luxury , a comfort of which we had lost all idea since our leaving France '' . At the conference in Tenkodogo it was agreed that the British would retreat the Mamprusi Kingdom 120km further south in the Gold Coast but only if the French would do the same and retreat from Tenkodogo . However the agreement was far more beneficial to the French , who in succeeding in getting the British out of Burkinaonly saw their agreement as temporary and planned on making a swift return once the British had fully retreated . Chanoine was reported as to saying `` We 've done it . The English were immobile at Kumasi , waiting for the winter to pass to take occupation of Mossi and Gourounsi already taken by Binger , Crozat and Monteil . We have faith in our civilising mission , the certainty of working for the good of the land , and for the future of France '' . The villages surrounding Tenkodogo are primarily based around animal husbandry . The main market takes place every 3 days . The Restaurant Patisserie Salon du ThÃ is known for its tea , yoghurt and pastries . The Le Rotisseur restaurant is known for its grilled chicken . Notable hotels include Hotel Djamou , Hotel Djamou Annexe , Hotel Laafi , and Auberge Riale . The town is connected to KoupÃ la and Bittou , along the N15 highway .

Theobalds Grove railway station serves Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire , England . It is part of the Lea Valley Lines network , and train services are provided by National Express East Anglia . The railway line from Bury Street Junction , north of the current Edmonton Green station , to Cheshunt was opened by the Great Eastern Railway on October 1 , 1891 . It was known as the Churchbury Loop . The district served by the line was still predominantly rural , and the coming of the tram to Waltham Cross in 1904 saw the railway unable to compete . Passenger services ceased on October 1 , 1909 , but were reinstated for the benefit of munitions workers between March 1 , 1915 and July 1 , 1919 . After that the line was only served by freight trains until the line was electrified as part of a wider scheme , and Theobalds Grove station reopened to passengers on November 21 , 1960 . The line is now known as the Southbury Loop . The goods depot at the station closed in 1967 . Its site is now the station car park . The station was much changed in the early 1980s along with several other stations on the line . The roofs on both platforms were removed and modern shorter replacements were installed ( similar structures were built at seven sisters Station at the same time ) . Steel stairs replaced the wooden stairs leading up to the north-bound platforms though the wooden cover was retained . The London-bound staircase was left unaltered . The ticket office was also partially reconstructed . The typical off-peak service from the station is two trains per hour to London Liverpool Street via Seven Sisters , and two trains per hour to Cheshunt from where onward connections can be made . Through trains to Hertford East run on Sundays and , prior to the rebuilding of Cheshunt Station in 2006 , Hertford east was the northern terminus of most trains serving the Southbury line .

Hans-Dietrich Genscher ( born 21 March 1927 ) is a German politician of the liberal Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) . He served as Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor of Germany from 1974 to 1982 and , after a two-week pause , from 1982 to 1992 , making him Germany 's longest serving Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor . In 1991 , he was Chairman of the OSCE . Genscher was born at Reideburg ( Province of Saxony ) , now a part of Halle , in what later became East Germany . He was drafted to serve as a member of the Air Force Support Personnel ( Luftwaffenhelfer ) at the age of 16 . In 1945 he became a member of the Nazi Party . According to Genscher 's statements , this happened through a collective application in his Wehrmacht unit and against his own intentions . Genscher fought as a young man in the Wehrmacht at the end of the Second World War . In 1945 , Genscher was a young soldier in General Walther Wenck 's 12th Army . Genscher briefly became an American and British prisoner of war . After World War II , he studied law and economics at the universities of Halle and Leipzig ( 1946 â `` 1949 ) and joined the East German Liberal Democratic Party ( LDPD ) in 1946 . In 1952 , Genscher fled to West Germany , where he joined the Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) . He passed his second state examination in law in Hamburg in 1954 and became a solicitor in Bremen . In 1965 Genscher was elected on the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP list to the West German parliament and remained a member of parliament until his retirement in 1998 . After serving in several party offices , he was appointed Minister of the Interior by Chancellor Willy Brandt , whose Social Democratic Party was in coalition with the FDP , in 1969 ; in 1974 , he became foreign minister and Vice Chancellor . In 1972 , while Minister for the Interior , he rejected Israelâ s offer to send an Israeli special forces unit to Germany to deal with the Black September hijacking of the 1972 Summer Olympics . The crisis ended in a bloody shootout at FÃ 1\/4 rstenfeldbruck Air Base which left 11 hostages , 5 terrorists , and 1 German policeman dead . Genscher 's popularity with Israel declined further when he endorsed the handing over of the three captured hijackers to the Palestinians following the hijacking of a Lufthansa plane on 29 October 1972 . In the SPD-FDP coalition , he helped shape Brandt 's policy of deescalation with the communist East , commonly known as Ostpolitik , which was continued under Helmut Schmidt after Brandt 's resignation in 1974 . Still , Genscher was one of the FDP 's driving forces when , in 1982 , the party switched sides from its coalition with the SPD to support the CDU\/CSU in their Constructive Vote of No Confidence to have Helmut Schmidt replaced with Helmut Kohl as Chancellor . Despite the great controversy that accompanied this switch , he remained one of the most popular politicians in West Germany . He retained his posts as foreign minister and vice chancellor through German reunification and until 1992 , when he stepped down for health reasons . He is mostly respected for his efforts that helped spell the end the Cold War , and which led to German reunification , when Communist eastern European governments toppled in the late 1980s ; for example , he visited Poland to meet Lech WaÅ Ä sa as early as 1988 . In 1988 , he was awarded the Prize For Freedom of the Liberal International . One event remembered by many is his 30 September 1989 speech from the balcony of the German embassy in Prague , in whose courtyard thousands of East German citizens had assembled to flee to the West , when he announced that he had reached an agreement with the Communist Czechoslovakian government that the refugees could leave : `` We have come to you to tell you that today , your departure ... '' ( German : `` Wir sind zu Ihnen gekommen , um Ihnen mitzuteilen , dass heute Ihre Ausreise ... '' ) . After these words , the speech drowned in cheers . In 1991 , Genscher raced to recognize the Republic of Croatia in the Croatian War of Independence shortly after the Serbian attack on Vukovar . The rest of the European Union was pressured to follow suit soon afterward . Genscher was also an active participant in the further development of the European Union , taking active part in the Single European Act Treaty negotiations in the mid 1980s , as well as the joint publication of the Genscher-Colombo plan with Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Emilio Colombo which advocated further integration and deepening of relations in the European Union towards a more federalist European State . Having finished his political career , Genscher has been active as a lawyer and in international relations organizations . He founded his own Hans-Dietrich Genscher Consult GmbH in 2000 .
Pig is a simple folk jeopardy dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945 . As with many games of folk origin , Pig is played with many rule variations . Commercial variants of Pig include Pass the Pigs , Pig Dice , and Skunk . Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probability concepts . Each turn , a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls ( i.e. the turn total ) . At any time during a player 's turn , the player is faced with two options : The first player to score 100 or more points wins . For example , the first player , Ann , begins a turn with a roll of 5 . Ann could hold and score 5 points , but chooses to roll again . Ann rolls a 2 , and could hold with a turn total of 7 points , but chooses to roll again . Ann rolls a 1 , and must end her turn without scoring . The next player , Bob , rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5 , after which he chooses to hold , and adds his turn total of 22 points to his score . Pig often serves as a simple , fun example for teaching probability concepts from the middle school level upwards . For example , the Interactive Mathematics Program uses The Game of Pig as the core example for its Year 1 probability curriculum , and offers a downloadable Pig simulation tool to test simple strategies for long term scoring . Similar curricular materials are available on the NZMaths Statistics Web-site . A more comprehensive list of online Pig teaching resources is also available . Pig also provides many valuable exercises for teaching Computer Science in areas ranging from introductory courses to advanced machine learning material . See Todd W. Neller , Clifton G.M. Presser , Ingrid Russell , Zdravko Markov . Pedagogical Possibilities for the Dice Game Pig . Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges , vol . 21 , no. 6 , pp . 149 -- 161 , June 2006 . A guide to computing optimal play for Pig and similar games is freely available as the NSF-sponsored project Solving the Dice Game Pig : an introduction to dynamic programming and value iteration . Optimal play for 2-player Pig was computed by Todd W. Neller and visualized by Clifton G. M. Presser in 2001 . The figure to the right visualizes optimal play . At any time , the relevant decision information includes the player 's score , the opponent 's score , and the turn total . Such information corresponds to a 3D point in the graph 's space . If this point is inside the gray solid , the player should roll . Otherwise , the player should hold . A Pig applet with an optimal computer opponent is also available . A more comprehensive list of Pig rule variations is also available . Below are a few variations in detail . Not to be confused with the commercial game Skunk , SKUNK ( a.k.a. THINK ) is a variation of Two-Dice Pig that is played with large groups . Rather than rolling in turn , all players begin the round standing . At any point in the round , a player may hold by sitting down . The round continues until a 1 is rolled , or all players have sat down . Skunk is played in five rounds , and scoring is recorded in a 5-column table with columns labeled with the letters of the word `` SKUNK '' . The first round score is entered in the `` S '' - column , the next in the first `` K '' - column , and so on . After five rounds , the highest-scoring player is the winner . Pig is one of a family of dice games called jeopardy dice games ( Reiner Knizia . Dice Games Properly Explained . Elliot Right-Way Books , Brighton Road , Lower Kingswood , Tadworth , Surrey , KT20 6TD UK , 1999 ) . For jeopardy dice games , the dominant type of decision is whether or not to jeopardize previous gains by rolling for potential greater gains . Most jeopardy dice games can be further subdivided into two categories : jeopardy race games and jeopardy approach games . In jeopardy race games , the object is to be the first to meet or exceed a goal score ( e.g. Pig , Pass the Pigs , Cosmic Wimpout , Ca n't Stop ) . In jeopardy approach games , the object is to most closely approach a goal score without exceeding it ( e.g. Twenty-One ( die variant of Blackjack ) , Macao ( R. Knizia . Dice Games Properly Explained .
In law , a trial is when parties to a dispute come together to present information ( in the form of evidence ) in a tribunal , a formal setting with the authority to adjudicate claims or disputes . One form of tribunal is a court . The tribunal , which may occur before a judge , jury , or other designated trier of fact , aims to achieve a resolution to their dispute . Bench trials are often resolved faster . Furthermore , a favorable ruling for one party in a bench trial will frequently lead the other party to offer a settlement . Hearings before administrative bodies may have many of the features of a trial before a court , but are typically not referred to as trials . An appellate proceeding is also generally not deemed a trial , because such proceedings are usually restricted to review of the evidence presented before the trial court , and do not permit the introduction of new evidence . Trials can also be divided by the type of dispute at issue . A criminal trial is designed to resolve accusations brought ( usually by a government ) against a person accused of a crime . In common law systems , most criminal defendants are entitled to a trial held before a jury . Because the state is attempting to use its power to deprive the accused of life , liberty , or property , the rights of the accused afforded to criminal defendants are typically broad . The rules of criminal procedure provide rules for criminal trials . A civil trial is generally held to settle lawsuits or civil claims - non-criminal disputes . In some countries , the government can both sue and be sued in a civil capacity . The rules of civil procedure provide rules for civil trials . Although administrative hearings are not ordinarily considered trials , they retain many elements found in more `` formal '' trial settings . When the dispute goes to judicial setting , it is called an administrative trial , to review the administrative hearing , depending on the jurisdiction . The types of disputes handled in these hearings is goverened by administrative law and auxiliarily by the civil trial law . Labor law ( also known as employment law ) is the body of laws , administrative rulings , and precedents which address the legal rights of , and restrictions on , working people and their organizations . As such , it mediates many aspects of the relationship between trade unions , employers and employees . In Canada , employment laws related to unionized workplaces are differentiated from those relating to particular individuals . In most countries however , no such distinction is made . However , there are two broad categories of labor law . First , collective labor law relates to the tripartite relationship between employee , employer and union . Second , individual labor law concerns employees ' rights at work and through the contract for work . The labor movement has been instrumental in the enacting of laws protecting labor rights in the 19th and 20th centuries . Labor rights have been integral to the social and economic development since the industrial revolution . Also see Hung jury . A judge may cancel a trial prior to the return of a verdict ; legal parlance designates this as a mistrial . A declaration of a mistrial generally means that the court must hold a retrial on the same subject . An important exception occurs in criminal cases in the United States . If the court erroneously declares a mistrial , or if prosecutorial misconduct forced the defendant into moving for a mistrial , the constitutional protection against double jeopardy bars any retrial . Some other kinds of processes for resolving conflicts are also expressed as trials . For example , the United States Constitution requires that , following the impeachment of the President , a judge , or another federal officer by the House of Representatives , the subject of the impeachment may only be removed from office by a trial in the Senate . In earlier times disputes were often settled through a trial by ordeal , where parties would have to endure physical suffering in order to prove their righteousness ; or through a trial by combat , in which the winner of a physical fight was deemed righteous in their cause .
The Major Oak is a huge oak tree near the village of Edwinstowe in the heart of Sherwood Forest , Nottinghamshire , England . According to local folklore , it was Robin Hood 's shelter where he and his merry men slept . It weighs an estimated 23 tons , has a waistline of 33 feet ( 10m ) , and is about 800 â `` 1000 years old . There are several theories concerning why it became so huge and oddly shaped : It took its present name from Major Hayman Rooke 's description of it in 1790 . Since the Victorian era its massive limbs have been partially supported by an elaborate system of scaffolding . In February 1998 , a local company took cuttings from the Major Oak and began cultivating clones of the famous tree with the intention of sending saplings to be planted in major cities around the world . In 1998 , a Mansfield resident was cautioned by the Nottinghamshire Police for selling alleged Major Oak acorns ( including a certificate of authenticity ) to unsuspecting Americans via an Internet-based mail-order company . In June 2002 , the Tree Council has designated The Major Oak one of fifty Great British Trees in recognition of its place in the national heritage . On October 1 , 2002 , another news story broke about someone illegally selling acorns from the Major Oak on an Internet-based auction website . In 2003 , in Dorset a plantation was started of 260 saplings grown from acorns of the Major Oak . The purpose was to provide a focal point for an Internet-based study of the Major Oak , its history , photographic record , variation in size and leafing of the saplings , comparison of their DNA , and an eventual public amenity . The Major Oak was featured on the 2005 television program Seven Natural Wonders as one of the wonders of the Midlands .
Cape Race is a point of land located at the southeastern tip of the Avalon Peninsula on the island of Newfoundland , Canada . Its name is thought to come from the original Portuguese name for this cape , `` Raso '' , or `` bare '' . The Cape appeared on early sixteenth century maps as Cape Raso and its name may derive from a cape of the same name at the mouth of the Tagus River in Portugal . Dense fog , rocky coasts , and its proximity to trans-Atlantic shipping routes have resulted in many shipwrecks near Cape Race over the years . One of the most famous was the . Cape Race is a flat barren point of land jutting out into the Atlantic Ocean , its cliffs rising nearly vertically to 30.5 m ( 100 ft ) above sea level . On average it is shrouded in fog on 158 days of the year . Located next to Trepassey . In 1856 , the first lighthouse was installed by the British Government 's Trinity House . It was a cast iron tower with a coal oil lamp turned by clockwork . It was replaced in 1907 by a 29 metres tall concrete tower and a light with a massive hyperradiant Fresnel lens made by Chance Brothers in England . The original lighthouse was then moved to Cape North ; it now stands in front of the Canada Science and Technology Museum in Ottawa . The light 's characteristic is a single white flash every 7.5 seconds , additionally a foghorn may sound a signal of two blasts every 60 seconds . There is also a high-power LORAN-C transmitter at Cape Race , whose mast was until the completion of CN Tower the tallest structure of Canada . From 1859 to 1866 , the New York City Associated Press kept a newsboat at Cape Race to meet ocean liners passing by on their way from Europe so that news could be telegraphed to New York . These news items carried the byline `` via Cape Race '' . In 1904 , the first wireless station in Newfoundland was built at Cape Race . This was one of the major land-based locations that received the distress call from the RMS Titanic , the other being , at least according to legend , the Marconi telegraph station on top of the Wanamaker 's department store in New York City . On the night the Titanic sank , wireless operator Jack Phillips was sending telegraphs to Cape Race for relay to New York City . When Cyril Evans , wireless operator of the SS Californian , sent an iceberg warning to the Titanic , only a few miles away , Phillips was annoyed with the loud signal ( due to the proximity ) and responded â Shut up , Shut up , Iâ m working Cape Race . â This would become a famous incident , as the bored Evans soon went to sleep , and Titanic hit an iceberg only fifteen minutes later . After Titanic 's distress call , Cape Race played a major role in relaying news of the sinking to other ships and land locations .

Noureddine Naybet M. ( ; born 10 February 1970 in Casablanca ) is a retired Moroccan international football player and captain . His position was central defender . Naybet made his greatest career run with Spanish first division team Deportivo La CoruÃ a , winning 1 league title , 1 Copa de Rey and 2 Spanish Super Cups . Naybet also earned 115 caps for the Moroccan national team , scoring 2 goals . In August 1999 Naybet agreed to a dream move to Treble winning Manchester United . However the Red Devils were worried about his injured knee and United subsequently signed MikaÃ `` l Silvestre instead . He did eventually make a move to the English Premiership with Tottenham Hotspur on 13 August 2004 aged 34 . Although an important member of the Tottenham first team in 2004-2005 , he was a reserve player under new boss Martin Jol , making only three league appearances in 2005-2006 . The influence brought by his vast experience is widely regarded as one of the factors behind the excellent partnership of Ledley King and Michael Dawson in the heart of the Spurs defense . His sole goal for Spurs came against rivals Arsenal , in a 5-4 defeat at White Hart Lane . In January 2006 , Naybet appeared for Morocco in the 2006 African Cup of Nations for the last time as he announced his retirement from international football afterwards . He was released from Tottenham Hotspur on 26 May 2006 and in August 2007 , became Morocco 's national team manager assistant to Henri Michel .

Leeuwarden ( , Stadsfries : Liwwadden , Frisian : Ljouwert , ) is the capital city of the Dutch province of Friesland . It is situated in the north of the country . The area has been occupied since the 10th century ( although recently , remains of houses dating back to the 2nd century AD were discovered during a dig near the Oldehove ) , and was granted a town charter in 1435 . Situated along the Middelzee , it was an active trade center , until the waterway silted up in the 15th century . In 1901 the city had a population of 32,203 . Famous natives of Leeuwarden include stadtholder William IV of Orange , graphic artist M. C. Escher , and dancer-spy Mata Hari , as well as the theologian Dr. N.H. Gootjes . During World War II , after extensive occupation by the German forces , on 15 April 1945 , the Royal Canadian Dragoons , disobeying direct orders , charged into the heavily defended city and defeated the Germans , who were driven out by the next day . The name `` Leeuwarden '' ( or old spelling variants ) first came into use for Nijehove , the most important one of the three villages that later merged into one , in the early 9th century ( Villa Lintarwrde ' c. 825 ) . There is much uncertainty about the origin of the city 's name . Historian and archivist Wopke Eekhoff summed up a total of over 200 different spelling variants , of which Leeuwarden ( Dutch ) , Liwwadden ( Stadsfries ) and Ljouwert ( West Frisian ) are still in use . The second syllable is easily explained . `` Warden '' , Dutch\/Frisian for an artificial dwelling hill , is a designation of a few terps , in accordance with the historical situation . The problem is the prefix , which could be interpreted as leeu - or ` leeuw - ' ( Dutch for lion ) . Some scholars believe the latter to be true , for a lion is also found in the city 's coat of arms . For this to be so , however , an extra `` w '' would be required . It should also be noted there have never been lions in Friesland . Other scholars argue the name came from the prefix leeu - , a corruption of luw - ( Dutch for sheltered ) or lee - ( a Dutch denotion of a water circulation ) . The last one suits the watery province of FryslÃ cents n. The coat of arms of Leeuwarden is the official symbol of the municipality of Leeuwarden . It consists of a blue escutcheon , a golden lion and a crown . The fact Leeuwarden carries a lion in its seal seems logical , considering that `` Leeuw '' is Dutch for `` Lion '' . However , it is very plausible the oldest name of the city conceals an indication of water rather than an animal . Some sources tell the lion had been called into life after the name became official . It 's also possible the coat of arms was a gift to the city from the powerful Minnema family . Well-known buildings in the city center include the Kanselarij ( the former chancellery ) , the Stadhouderlijk hof , former residence of the stadtholders of Friesland , the Waag ( old trade center of the city ) , the church of St. Bonifatius and the leaning tower Oldehove . The tallest building in the city is the 115 metre tall Achmeatoren ( Achmea insurance tower ) . Leeuwarden is also the site of the country 's largest cattle market , and on Ascension Day , the largest flower market in the Netherlands is held here . The FroskepÃ lemolen is the last surviving windmill of over 130 known to have stood in Leeuwarden . The remains of the Cammingha-Buurstermolen were demolished in 2000 . The bases of two other windmills , Wielinga-Stam and De Haan also survive . Leeuwarden has a number of respected universities of applied science ( HBO in Dutch ) , such as the Van Hall Instituut ( agricultural and life sciences ) , the Stenden University ( economical and catering ) and the Noordelijke Hogeschool Leeuwarden ( economical , technical and arts ) . Although the city has no scientific university , several dependencies are located here , including the Wageningen University , Universiteit Twente and the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen . About 16,000 students , among them an increasing number of foreign students , study at technical schools . Besides higher education , the city is also home to two regional vocational schools ( MBO ) : the Friese Poort and Friesland College . Leeuwarden is the starting and finishing point for the celebrated Elfstedentocht , a 200 km-long speed skating race over the Frisian waterways that is held when winter conditions in the province allow . It last took place in January 1997 , preceded by the races of 1986 and 1985 . The city 's local football team , Cambuur Leeuwarden plays in the Eerste Divisie . In the season 2005\/06 , the club narrowly escaped bankruptcy . Its Cambuurstadion opened in 1995 . The football team has proposed plans for a new stadium in the east side of the city , which will cost â 35 million . Leeuwarden , as capital of the province of Friesland , is seat of the provincial authorities .
In psychiatry , thought disorder or formal thought disorder is a term used to describe incomprehensible language , either speech or writing , that is presumed to reflect thinking . There are different types . For example , language may be difficult to understand if it switches quickly from one unrelated idea to other ( flight of ideas ) or if it is long-winded and very delayed at reaching its goal ( circumstantiality ) or if words are inappropriately strung together resulting in gibberish ( word salad ) . Psychiatrists consider Formal Thought Disorder as being one of two types of `` thinking '' or `` thought '' disorders . The other type being delusions . The latter involves `` content '' while the former involves `` form '' . Although the term `` thought disorder '' can refer to either type , in common parlance it refers most often to a disorder of thought `` form '' also known as Formal Thought Disorder . It is usually considered a symptom of psychotic mental illness , although it occasionally appears in other conditions . For example , pressured speech and flight of ideas may be present in mania . Clanging or echolalia may be present in Tourette syndrome . Eugen Bleuler , who named schizophrenia , held that its defining characteristic was a disorder of the thinking process . However , Formal thought disorder is not unique to schizophrenia or psychosis . So-called â organicâ patients with a clouded consciousness , like that found in delirium , also have a formal thought disorder . However , there is a distinct clinical difference between the two . Schizophrenic or psychotic patients never demonstrate awareness nor concern about it because it results from a fundamental inability to use the same type of Aristotelian logic as everyone else does whereas so-called â organicâ patients with a clouded consciousness usually do demonstrate awareness and concern about it , by complaining about being â confusedâ or â unable to think straightâ because it results , instead , from various cognitive deficits . Thought is revealed through speech . Thus , observation of patterns of thought naturally involves close observation of the speech of the individual being considered . Although it is normal to exhibit some of the following during times of extreme stress ( e.g. a cataclysmic event or the middle of a war ) it is the degree , frequency , and the resulting functional impairment that leads to the conclusion that the person being observed has a thought disorder . Q : `` What city are you from ? '' A : `` Well , that 's a hard question . I 'm from Iowa . I really do n't know where my relatives came from , so I do n't know if I 'm Irish or French . '' The concept of thought disorder has been criticized as being based on circular or incoherent definitions . For example , thought disorder is inferred from disordered speech , however it is assumed that disordered speech arises because of disordered thought . Similarly the definition of ` Incoherence ' ( word salad ) is that speech is incoherent . Furthermore , although thought disorder is typically associated with psychosis , similar phenomena can appear in different disorders , potentially leading to misdiagnosisâ '' for example , in the case of incomplete yet potentially fruitful thought processes . It has been suggested that individuals with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) display language disturbances like those found in schizophrenia . A 2008 study found that children and adolescents with ASD showed significantly more illogical thinking and loose associations than control subjects . The illogical thinking was related to cognitive functioning and executive control ; the loose associations were related to communication symptoms and to parent reports of stress and anxiety .
Boletus is a genus of mushroom , comprising over 100 species . The genus Boletus was originally broadly defined and described by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821 , essentially containing all fungi with pores . Since then , other genera have been defined gradually , such as Tylopilus by Petter Adolf Karsten in 1881 , and old names such as Leccinum have been resurrected or redefined . Some mushrooms listed in older books as members of the genus have now been placed in separate genera . These include such as Boletus scaber , now Leccinum scabrum , Tylopilus felleus , Chalciporus piperatus and Suillus luteus . The name is derived from the Latin term bÅ lÄ `` tus ` mushroom ' from the Ancient Greek Î Ï Î '' Î Ï Î Ï , ultimately from bÅ los \/ Î Ï Î '' Î Ï ` lump ' or ` clod ' . However , the Î Ï Î '' Î Ï Î Ï of Galen is thought to have been the much prized Amanita caesarea . The genus Boletus contains many members which are edible and tasty , not the least of which is the famed Boletus edulis , though many others are eaten as well , such as B. badius , B. aereus and others . Many species , such as B. calopus , are bitter tasting and inedible , and others are toxic . Several guidebooks recommend avoiding all red-pored boletes , however both B. erythropus and B. luridus are edible when well-cooked . However , there has been one recorded instance of death from Boletus pulcherrimus in 1994 ; a couple developed gastrointestinal symptoms after eating this fungus , with the husband succumbing . Autopsy revealed infarction of the midgut . Boletus satanas has also long considered to be poisonous , though it has not been responsible for any deaths . The symptoms are predominantly gastrointestinal in nature . A glycoprotein , bolesatine , has been isolated . A similar compound bolevenine has been isolated from the poisonous Boletus venenatus of Japan . Muscarine has been isolated from some red-pored species , although the amounts are pharmacologically insignificant and unlikely to cause symptoms .
Brassica ( brÃ s-si-ca ) is a genus of plants in the mustard family ( Brassicaceae ) . The members of the genus may be collectively known either as cabbages , or as mustards . Crops from this genus are sometimes called cole crops , which is derived from the Latin caulis , meaning stem or cabbage . This genus is remarkable for containing more important agricultural and horticultural crops than any other genus . It also includes a number of weeds , both wild taxa and escapees from cultivation . It includes over 30 wild species and hybrids , and numerous additional cultivars and hybrids of cultivated origin . Most are annuals or biennials , but some are small shrubs . Due to their agricultural importance , Brassica plants have been the subject of much scientific interest . Six particularly important species ( Brassica carinata , B. juncea , B. oleracea , B. napus , B. nigra and B. rapa ) are derived by combining the chromosomes from three earlier species , as described by the Triangle of U theory . The genus is native in the wild in western Europe , the Mediterranean and temperate regions of Asia . In addition to the cultivated species , which are grown worldwide , many of the wild species grow as weeds , especially in North America , South America , and Australia . Almost all parts of some species or other have been developed for food , including the root ( rutabaga , turnips ) , stems ( kohlrabi ) , leaves ( cabbage , brussels sprouts ) , flowers ( cauliflower , broccoli ) , and seeds ( many , including mustard seed , and oil-producing rapeseed ) . Some forms with white or purple foliage or flowerheads are also sometimes grown for ornament . Brassica species are sometimes used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera speciesâ '' see List of Lepidoptera that feed on Brassica . Brassica vegetables are highly regarded for their nutritional value . They provide high amounts of vitamin C and soluble fiber and contain multiple nutrients with potent anticancer properties : 3,3 ' - diindolylmethane , sulforaphane and selenium . Boiling reduces the level of anticancer compounds , but steaming , microwaving , and stir frying do not result in significant loss . Steaming the vegetable for three to four minutes is recommended to maximize sulforaphane . Brassica vegetables are rich in indole-3-carbinol , a chemical which boosts DNA repair in cells and appears to block the growth of cancer cells . They are also a good source of carotenoids , with broccoli having especially high levels . Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have recently discovered that 3,3 ' - diindolylmethane in Brassica vegetables is a potent modulator of the innate immune response system with potent antiviral , antibacterial and anticancer activity ; however , it also is an antiandrogen . These vegetables also contain goitrogens , which suppress thyroid function . This can induce hypothyroidism and goiter . There is some disagreement among botanists on the classification and status of Brassica species and subspecies . The following is an abbreviated list , with an emphasis on economically important species . Bayer Cropscience ( in collaboration with BGI-Shenzhen , China , Keygene N.V. , the Netherlands and the University of Queensland , Australia ) announced it had sequenced the entire genome of rapeseed\/canola ( Brassica napus ) and its constituent genomes present in B. rapa and B. oleracea in 2009 . The B. rapa genome is currently being sequenced by the Multinational Brassica Genome Project . This also represents the A genome component of the amphidiploid crop species B. napus and B. juncea .
The Redcurrant ( Ribes rubrum ) is a member of the genus Ribes in the gooseberry family Grossulariaceae , native to parts of western Europe ( Belgium , France , Germany , Netherlands , Northern Italy Northern Spain and Portugal ) . It is a deciduous shrub normally growing to 1-1 .5 m tall , occasionally 2 m , with five-lobed leaves arranged spirally on the stems . The flowers are inconspicuous yellow-green , in pendulous 4 â `` 8 cm racemes , maturing into bright red translucent edible berries about 8 â `` 12 mm diameter , with 3-10 berries on each raceme . An established bush can produce 3-4 kilos of berries from mid to late summer . There are several other similar species native in Europe , Asia and North America , also with edible fruit , though usually considered to have an inferior flavor . These include Ribes spicatum ( northern Europe and northern Asia ) , Ribes alpinum ( Northern Europe ) , R. schlechtendalii ( northeast Europe ) , R. multiflorum ( southeast Europe ) , R. petraeum ( southwest Europe ) and R. triste ( North America ; Newfoundland to Alaska and southward in mountains ) . While Ribes rubrum and R. nigrum are native to northern and eastern Europe , large berried cultivars of the redcurrant were first produced in Belgium and northern France in the 17th century . In modern times , numerous cultivars have been selected ; some of these have escaped gardens and can be found in the wild across Europe and extending into Asia . The white currant is also a cultivar of Ribes rubrum . Although it is sweeter and albino variant of the redcurrant , it is not a separate botanical species and is sometimes marketed with names such as Ribes sativum or Ribes silvestre , or sold as a different fruit . Currant bushes prefer partial to full sunlight , and can grow in most types of soil . They are relatively low-maintenance plants and can also be used as ornamentation . With maturity , the tart flavor of redcurrant fruit is slightly greater than its blackcurrant relative , but with the same approximate sweetness . The albino variant of redcurrant , often referred to as white currant , has the same tart flavor but with greater sweetness . Although frequently cultivated for jams and cooked preparations , much like the white currant , it is often served raw or as a simple accompaniment in salads , garnishes , or drinks when in season . In the United Kingdom , redcurrant jelly is a condiment traditionally served with lamb in a Sunday roast . It is essentially a jam and is made in the same way , by adding the redcurrants to sugar and boiling . In France , the highly rarefied and hand-made Bar-le-duc or Lorraine jelly is a spreadable preparation traditionally made from white currants or alternatively red currants . In Scandinavia and Schleswig Holstein , it is often used in fruit soups and summer puddings ( RÃ dgrÃ d , Rote GrÃ 1\/4 tze or Rode GrÃ 1\/4 tt ) ; in Germany it is also used in combination with custard or meringue as a filling for tarts ; in Linz , Austria , it is the most commonly used filling for the Linzer torte . Unlike the cranberry , it certainly can be enjoyed in its fresh state and without the addition of sugar . In German-speaking areas , syrup or nectar derived from the red currant is added to soda water and enjoyed as a refreshing drink named Johannisbeerenschorle . It is so named because the redcurrant ( Johannisbeeren in German ) are said to first ripen on Johannistag or June 24 . Although blackcurrant is more traditionally associated with medicinal uses , English and German language herbalist sources consider redcurrant berries to have fever-reducing , sweat-inducing , menstrual-flow inducing , mildly laxative , astringent , appetite increasing , diuretic and digestive properties . Some of these proposed effects are probable , due to the verified high levels of vitamin C , fruit acids , and fiber the berries contain . Tea made from dried redcurrant leaves is said to ease the symptoms of gout and rheumatism , be useful in compresses for poorly healing wounds , and as a gargling solution for mouth infections . The fruits are a good source of vitamins B1 and C , and are rich in iron , phosphorus , potassium , fiber , copper and manganese . Dried currants are considered highly alkalizing .

Rorquals are the largest group of baleen whales , with nine species in two genera . They include the largest animal that has ever lived , the Blue Whale , which can reach 150 t , and two others that easily pass 50 t ; even the smallest of the group , the Northern Minke Whale , reaches 9 t. Rorquals take their name from French rorqual , which itself derives from the Norwegian word rÃ yrkval , meaning `` furrow whale '' . All members of the family have a series of longitudinal folds of skin running from below the mouth back to the navel ( except the Sei Whale , which has shorter grooves ) . These are understood to allow the mouth to expand immensely when feeding . The `` Minke '' is allegedly named after a Norwegian whaler named Meincke , who mistook a Northern Minke Whale for a Blue Whale . Rorquals are slender and streamlined in shape , compared with their relatives the right whales , and most have narrow , elongated flippers . They have a dorsal fin , situated far back on the body , near to the tail . Rorquals feed by gulping in water , and then pushing it out through the baleen plates with their tongue . They feed on crustaceans , such as krill , but also on various fish , such as herrings and sardines . Gestation in rorquals lasts 11 â `` 12 months , so that both mating and birthing occur at the same time of year . Mothers give birth to a single young , which is weaned after 6 â `` 12 months , depending on species . Of some species , adults live in small herds , or `` pods '' of two to five individuals . For example , Humpback whales have a fluid social structure , often engaging behavioral practices in a pod , other times being soloâ '' not necessarily living together . Distribution is worldwide : the Blue , Fin , Humpback , and the Sei Whales are found in all major oceans ; the Common ( Northern ) and Antarctic ( Southern ) Minke Whale species are found in all the oceans of their respective hemispheres ; and either of Bryde 's Whale and Eden 's Whale occur in the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian oceans , being absent only from the cold waters of the Arctic and Antarctic . Most rorquals are strictly oceanic : the exceptions are Bryde 's Whale and Eden 's Whale ( which are usually found close to shore all year round ) and the Humpback Whale ( which is oceanic but passes close to shore when migrating ) . It is the largest and the smallest typesâ '' the Blue Whale and Antarctic Minke Whaleâ '' that occupy the coldest waters in the extreme south ; the Fin Whale tends not to approach so close to the ice shelf ; the Sei Whale tends to stay further north again . ( In the northern hemisphere , where the continents distort weather patterns and ocean currents , these movements are less obvious , although still present . ) Within each species , the largest individuals tend to approach the poles more closely , while the youngest and fittest ones tend to stay in warmer waters before leaving on their annual migration . Most rorquals breed in temperate waters during the winter , then migrate back to the polar feeding grounds rich in plankton and krill for the short polar summer . As well as other methods , rorqual whales obtain prey by lunge feeding on bait balls . Lunge feeding is an extreme feeding method , where the whale accelerates to a high velocity and then opens its mouths to a large gape angle . This generates the water pressure required to expand its mouth and engulf and filter a huge amount of water and fish . According to Potvin and Goldbogen , lunge feeding in rorqual whales represents the largest biomechanical event on Earth . Formerly the rorqual family Balaenopteridae was split into two subfamilies , Balaenopterinae and Megapterinae , with each subfamily contained one genus , Balaenoptera and Megaptera respectively . However , the phylogeny of the various rorqual species shows the current division is paraphyletic , and in 2005 the division into subfamilies was dropped . The discovery of a new species in Balaenopteridae , Omura 's whale ( Balaenoptera omurai ) , was announced in November 2003 , which looks similar to , if smaller than , the Fin Whale were found in Indo-Pacific waters .

During arousal , the glans becomes engorged with blood and sometimes protrudes outside from the clitoral hood or bulging under it . RPM was a Canadian music industry publication that featured song and album charts for Canada . The publication was founded by Walt Grealis in February 1964 , supported through its existence by record label owner Stan Klees . RPM ceased publication in November 2000 . RPM stood for `` Records , Promotion , Music '' . The magazine was reported to have variations in its title over the years such as RPM Weekly and RPM Magazine . RPM maintained several format charts including Top Singles ( all genres ) , Adult Contemporary , Rock\/Alternative ( Rock , alternative rock ) and Country Tracks ( aka Top Country Tracks ) for country music . The modern Juno Awards had their origins in an annual survey conducted by RPM since its founding year . Readers of the magazine were invited to mail in survey ballots to indicate their choices under various categories of people or companies . The RPM Awards poll was transformed into a formal awards ceremony , The Gold Leaf Awards in 1970 . These became the Juno Awards in following years . A column on page 6 of that issue noted that the actual vote winner for Top Canadian Content record company was disqualified due to a conflict of interest involving an employee of that company who was also working for RPM .
A motorcade ( sometimes known as a convoy , carcade or autocade ) is a procession of vehicles . The term motorcade was coined by Lyle Abbot ( in 1912 or 1913 , when he was automobile editor of the Arizona Republican ) , and is formed after cavalcade on the false notion that '' - cade '' was a suffix meaning `` procession '' . In fact , there is no such suffix in either French or Latin , although - cade has now since become a productive suffix in English , leading to the alternative names carcade , autocade , and even Hoovercade ( after J. Edgar Hoover ) . Eric Partridge calls the name a `` monstrosity '' , and Lancelot Hogben considers the word to be a `` counterfeit coinage '' . The original suffix in cavalcade is actually '' - ade '' . A funeral cortege is a procession of mourners , most often in a motorcade of vehicles following a hearse . Motorcades can be used as protests and demonstrations . A large , organised , group of vehicles will travel a busy route at very slow speed in order to deliberately cause traffic disruption . This a tactic most often associated with protest groups that have access to many large vehicles , such as truckers and farmers . An example is the 2005 UK protests against fuel prices . Motorcades can be used to transport a very important person , usually a political figure . Such a procession consists of several vehicles , usually accompanied by law enforcement support and additional protection to ensure the safety of the people in the motorcade . Motorcades for presidents and heads of state consist of anywhere from four to six armored cars or SUVs , with police motorcycles and cars leading the way and following . Depending on the size of the motorcade and who it is carrying , routes may be completely blockaded from the general public . For security reasons , this is common with motorcades for heads of state or government . The motorcade for the President of the United States comprises twenty to thirty vehicles ; in addition to the president , the motorcade may carry his spouse , members of the press , security , White House officials , and VIP guests . The major members travel in armored vehicles , typically specially configured limousines . The motorcade contains several armored vehicles , a USSS Electronic Countermeasures Suburban , a counter-assault team , and Secret Service agents . When called for , a hazardous materials team precedes the motorcade on alert for potential hazards . A police presence precedes the beginning of the presidential motorcade . These cars and motorcycles usually drive ahead to clear the way and block traffic . The motorcade for the president is made up of two parts , the first being the `` secure package '' . In the event of an emergency , the secure package separates from the rest of the group . It includes two limousines , is heavily guarded by local law enforcement and Secret Service , with all cars driven by professional drivers . The second part is made up of vans that transport White House staff members and selected members of the press . In the rear is the WHCA Roadrunner communications van â `` which provides the primary communications path via satellite , allowing bi-directional voice , data and streaming video â `` an ambulance , and additional police vehicles . Motorcade routes are selected by Secret Service agents in cooperation with local police forces . Escape routes are also established in the event of an emergency .

Takahiro Yamada is a retired Japanese football ( soccer ) player . He was a skillful attacking midfielder . Yamada was educated at and played for Shimizu Commercial High School . At the high school , he won the national high school championship and the national youth championship with his team mates including Hiroshi Nanami , Go Oiwa and Shigeyoshi Mochizuki . Some scouts regarded him as the No. 1 high school player of his age . After graduating in 1990 , he joined Japan Soccer League side Nissan Motor F.C. where his powerful dribbling helped him quickly establish himself as a regular . When Japan 's first-ever professional league J. League started in 1993 , Nissan F.C. was transformed to Yokohama Marinos for whom he continued to play . He moved to Kyoto Purple Sanga in 1998 , and then to Verdy Kawasaki in 1999 . He announced the retirement from the game after the 1999 season at the age of 29 .

A derby ( in most of the English-speaking world and in North American English ) is a type of horse race , named after the Derby Stakes , still run at Epsom Downs Racecourse in England . It was in turn named for Edward Smith-Stanley , 12th Earl of Derby , who inaugurated the race in 1780 . The best-known example in the United States is the Kentucky Derby . Traditionally , the term `` derby '' is used strictly to refer to races restricted to three-year-olds , as the English and U.S. Triple Crown races all are . The most notable exceptions to this rule are the Hong Kong Derby and Singapore Derby , restricted to four-year-old Thoroughbreds , and the Canadian Pacing Derby , an annual harness race for `` aged pacers '' ( Standardbreds ) four years old and up .
Class 341 and Class 342 were proposed electric multiple unit classes from the Networker series planned to operate new services on the UK rail network . The Class 341 was to be operated on the original version of the Crossrail project . The project for these units never went ahead . A mock-up unit demonstrating the design of the train was built in 1991 . One version of Class 341 would have had it forming part of the Networker family . An artist 's impression can be found here . The specifications drawn up for the Class 341 have since been used as a base for laying down specifications for the new rolling stock to be built to run on Crossrail once it is begins operations in 2017 . The Class 342 was planned to be utilised in operating domestic services on the CTRL high speed line between London and the Kent coast . These services were abandoned before the line was opened , and so the trains never got beyond the proposal stage . The CTRL , or High Speed 1 as it is now known , did not finally open until 2007 and domestic services began running in 2009 , operated by Southeastern using Class 395 high speed trains .

Thomas Patrick Barrasso ( born March 31 , 1965 ) is a retired American professional ice hockey goaltender who played 18 seasons for the Buffalo Sabres , Pittsburgh Penguins , Ottawa Senators , Carolina Hurricanes , Toronto Maple Leafs , and St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League , and the only goalie to ever play in the NHL directly from high school , without having played major junior , college , or some other form of professional hockey first . The youngest winner of the league 's Vezina Trophy for best goaltender , as an 18-year old rookie in 1984 , he was inducted as a member of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2009 . He is still in charge of goaltending development for the Carolina Hurricanes . Tom Barrasso grew up in the town of Stow , Massachusetts , playing ice hockey on an outdoor rink . He started playing goalie at the age of five years old and by the time he was a teenager , was playing in net for Acton-Boxborough with fellow NHL players Bob Sweeney and Jeff Norton , Barrasso was considered one of the most promising American goaltending prospects of all time . He was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres with the 5th overall pick in 1983 . Skipping a college career , he went straight from high school to the NHL . At the time of his debut with the Sabres on October 5 , 1983 , less than six months after graduating from high school , Barrasso was the youngest goaltender to play and win a game in the NHL since Harry Lumley nearly forty years prior . He won the Calder Trophy and Vezina Trophy in his first season , becoming the third player to win both awards in the same year . In 1988 , the Sabres traded Barrasso to the Pittsburgh Penguins where he won two Stanley Cups , in 1991 and 1992 . It was his play in these Cup runs that established him as a `` money goalie '' . In the following years , Barrasso almost entirely missed two seasons , the 1994 â `` 95 NHL season and the 1996 â `` 97 NHL season with injuries but came back with good performances in the next years . In 1997 , he became the first American goaltender to record 300 NHL wins . A fiercely proud competitor , in his later seasons in Pittsburgh he developed a strained relationship with the local media , whom he felt were disrespectful of him and his family . In March 2000 , he was traded to the Ottawa Senators for Ron Tugnutt and Janne Laukkanen . He spent the entire 2000 â `` 01 season out of hockey and returned with the Carolina Hurricanes in time for the 2001 â `` 02 season . He enjoyed some late international success , winning Silver at the 2002 Winter Olympics . In his last few seasons he briefly played for several teams , the Ottawa Senators , the Carolina Hurricanes , the Toronto Maple Leafs , and the St. Louis Blues until retiring from ice hockey in 2003 . He signed a pro forma contract with Pittsburgh on the day he declared retirement so he could leave hockey as a Penguin . Barrasso won an Olympic silver medal as part of the U.S. national men 's ice hockey team at the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City . He played in one game , an 8 â `` 1 victory over Belarus on February 18 . Barrasso had originally intended to play for the 1984 U.S. Olympic team in Sarajevo , but chose to begin his professional career instead and left the team in September 1983 to sign with the Sabres . He made his debut for Team USA at the 1984 Canada Cup , at the age of 19 . He also played in the 1983 World Junior Championships , the 1986 World Ice Hockey Championships and the 1987 Canada Cup .

On May 11 , 2008 , a 46-year-old female passenger of Norwegian Dawn fell over the railing into the Atlantic Ocean about 45 m northeast of Atlantic City during a cruise from New York to Bermuda . Foul weather that night and early morning forced the coast guard to stop in their search for the woman . On November 27 , 2009 , Norwegian Dawn lost all power while returning to Miami . United States Coast Guard ships and helicopters were dispatched to the scene to assist . During the power outage , the more than 2,000 passengers on the ship had no access to running water , electricity , air conditioning or toilet services in the hot Caribbean environment . The temperatures in the area at the time were around 85 Â with 67 % relative humidity . At least some power was restored and the ship was able to make port in San Juan , PR , not Miami as the itinerary dictated , to allow repairs to be made . On August 27 , 2010 , the Dawn experienced engine problems . NCL gave all passengers $ 50.00 back from their port charges , as they had to leave Bermuda early to return to New York at a slower speed . Norwegian Dawn was the second in a line of two ships with this design , constructed at Meyer Werft Shipyard in Papenburg , Germany . Her sister ship is Norwegian Star , which entered service in November 2001 . At the time of their order with Meyer Werft , these two ships were designated as Libra-class ( Dawn-class in NCL publicity , as the Libra-class designation was because of its original assignment by Star Cruises until they were assigned to NCL operations ) . NCL continued using the same class designation for these ships . As with her sister vessel , Norwegian Dawn has restaurants , bars , entertainment and activity areas , and an eight-deck high atrium . One of her more distinctive features are twin Garden Villa staterooms .

In the United States and Canada , a cookie is a small , flat-baked treat , usually containing fat , flour , eggs and sugar . In most English-speaking countries outside North America , the most common word for this is biscuit ; in many regions both terms are used , while in others the two words have different meanings . A cookie is a plain bun in Scotland , while in the United States a biscuit is a kind of quick bread similar to a scone . In the United Kingdom , a cookie is referred to as a baked biscuit most commonly containing chocolate chips . Its name derives from the Dutch word koekje or ( informal ) koekie which means little cake , and arrived in the English language through the Dutch in North America . Cookies are most commonly baked until crisp or just long enough that they remain soft , but some kinds of cookies are not baked at all . Cookies are made in a wide variety of styles , using an array of ingredients including sugars , spices , chocolate , butter , peanut butter , nuts or dried fruits . The softness of the cookie may depend on how long it is baked . A general theory of cookies may be formulated this way . Despite its descent from cakes and other sweetened breads , the cookie in almost all its forms has abandoned water as a medium for cohesion . Water in cakes serves to make the base ( in the case of cakes called `` batter '' ) as thin as possible , which allows the bubbles â `` responsible for a cake 's fluffiness â `` to form better . In the cookie , the agent of cohesion has become some form of oil . Oils , whether they be in the form of butter , egg yolks , vegetable oils or lard are much more viscous than water and evaporate freely at a much higher temperature than water . Thus a cake made with butter or eggs instead of water is far denser after removal from the oven . Oils in baked cakes do not behave as soda tends to in the finished result . Rather than evaporating and thickening the mixture , they remain , saturating the bubbles of escaped gases from what little water there might have been in the eggs , if added , and the carbon dioxide released by heating the baking powder . This saturation produces the most texturally attractive feature of the cookie , and indeed all fried foods : crispness saturated with a moisture ( namely oil ) that does not sink into it . Cookie-like hard wafers have existed for as long as baking is documented , in part because they deal with travel very well , but they were usually not sweet enough to be considered cookies by modern standards . Cookies appear to have their origins in 7th century Persia , shortly after the use of sugar became relatively common in the region . They spread to Europe through the Muslim conquest of Spain . By the 14th century , they were common in all levels of society , throughout Europe , from royal cuisine to street vendors . With global travel becoming widespread at that time , cookies made a natural travel companion , a modernized equivalent of the travel cakes used throughout history . One of the most popular early cookies , which traveled especially well and became known on every continent by similar names , was the jumble , a relatively hard cookie made largely from nuts , sweetener , and water . Cookies came to America in the early English settlement ( the 17th century ) , although the name `` koekje '' arrived with the Dutch . This became Anglicized to `` cookie '' or cooky . Among the popular early American cookies were the macaroon , gingerbread cookies , and of course jumbles of various types . The most common modern cookie , given its style by the creaming of butter and sugar , was not common until the 18th century . Cookies also may be decorated with an icing , especially chocolate , and closely resemble a type of confectionery . A basic biscuit ( cookie ) recipe includes flour , shortening ( often lard ) , baking powder or soda , milk ( buttermilk or sweet milk ) and sugar . Common savory variations involve substituting sugar with an ingredient such as cheese or other dairy products . Shortbread is a popular biscuit in the UK .
The blood vessels are the part of the circulatory system that transport blood throughout the body . There are three major types of blood vessels : the arteries , which carry the blood away from the heart ; the capillaries , which enable the actual exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the tissues ; and the veins , which carry blood from the capillaries back toward the heart . The arteries and veins have different structures , veins having two layers and arteries having three . as well as nutrient capillaries ( vasa vasorum ) in the larger blood vessels . Capillaries consist of little more than a layer of endothelium and occasional connective tissue . When blood vessels connect to form a region of diffuse vascular supply it is called an anastomosis ( pl . Anastomoses provide critical alternative routes for blood to flow in case of blockages . They are roughly grouped as arterial and venous , determined by whether the blood in it is flowing away from ( arterial ) or toward ( venous ) the heart . The term `` arterial blood '' is nevertheless used to indicate blood high in oxygen , although the pulmonary artery carries `` venous blood '' and blood flowing in the pulmonary vein is rich in oxygen . This is because they are carrying the blood to and from the lungs , respectively , to be oxygenated . Blood vessels do not actively engage in the transport of blood ( they have no appreciable peristalsis ) , but arteries - and veins to a degree - can regulate their inner diameter by contraction of the muscular layer . This changes the blood flow to downstream organs , and is determined by the autonomic nervous system . Vasodilation and vasoconstriction are also used antagonistically as methods of thermoregulation . Oxygen ( bound to hemoglobin in red blood cells ) is the most critical nutrient carried by the blood . In all arteries apart from the pulmonary artery , hemoglobin is highly saturated ( 95-100 % ) with oxygen . In all veins apart from the pulmonary vein , the hemoglobin is desaturated at about 75 % . ( The values are reversed in the pulmonary circulation . ) The blood pressure in blood vessels is traditionally expressed in millimetres of mercury ( 1 mmHg = 133 Pa ) . In the arterial system , this is usually around 120 mmHg systolic ( high pressure wave due to contraction of the heart ) and 80 mmHg diastolic ( low pressure wave ) . In contrast , pressures in the venous system are constant and rarely exceed 10 mmHg . Vasoconstriction is the constriction of blood vessels ( narrowing , becoming smaller in cross-sectional area ) by contracting the vascular smooth muscle in the vessel walls . It is regulated by vasoconstrictors ( agents that cause vasoconstriction ) . These include paracrine factors ( e.g. prostaglandins ) , a number of hormones ( e.g. vasopressin and angiotensin ) and neurotransmitters ( e.g. epinephrine ) from the nervous system . Vasodilation is a similar process mediated by antagonistically acting mediators . The most prominent vasodilator is nitric oxide ( termed endothelium-derived relaxing factor for this reason ) . Permeability of the endothelium is pivotal in the release of nutrients to the tissue . It is also increased in inflammation in response to histamine , prostaglandins and interleukins , which leads to most of the symptoms of inflammation ( swelling , redness and warmth ) . Blood vessels play a huge role in virtually every medical condition . Cancer , for example , can not progress unless the tumor causes angiogenesis ( formation of new blood vessels ) to supply the malignant cells ' metabolic demand . Atherosclerosis , the formation of lipid lumps ( atheromas ) in the blood vessel wall , is the most common cardiovascular disease , the main cause of death in the Western world . Blood vessel permeability is increased in inflammation . Damage , due to trauma or spontaneously , may lead to hemorrhage due to mechanical damage to the vessel endothelium . In contrast , occlusion of the blood vessel by atherosclerotic plaque , by an embolised blood clot or a foreign body leads to downstream ischemia ( insufficient blood supply ) and possibly necrosis . Vessel occlusion tends to be a positive feedback system ; an occluded vessel creates eddies in the normally laminar flow or plug flow blood currents . These eddies create abnormal fluid velocity gradients which push blood elements such as cholesterol or chylomicron bodies to the endothelium . These deposit onto the arterial walls which are already partially occluded and build upon the blockage . Vasculitis is inflammation of the vessel wall , due to autoimmune disease or infection .

Hohenzollern-Hechingen was a county and principality in southwestern Germany . Its rulers belonged to a branch of the senior Swabian branch of the Hohenzollern dynasty . The County of Hohenzollern-Hechingen was created in 1576 , upon the partition of the County of Hohenzollern , a fief of the Holy Roman Empire . When the last count of Hohenzollern , Charles I of Hohenzollern ( 1512 â `` 1579 ) died , the territory was to be divided up between his three sons : Unlike the Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg and Prussia , the Hohenzollerns of southwest Germany remained Roman Catholic . The County was raised to a principality in 1623 . The principality joined the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 and was a member state of the German Confederation between 1815 and 1850 . The democratic Revolution of 1848 was relatively successful in Hohenzollern , and on 16 May 1848 , the Prince was forced to accept the establishment of a constitution . However , the conflict between monarch and democrats continued , and on August 6 , Hohenzollern was occupied by Prussian forces . On December 7 , 1849 , Prince Friedrich Wilhelm Konstantin sold the country to his relative , King Frederick William IV of Prussia . On 12 March 1850 , Hohenzollern-Hechingen officially became part of Prussia , and formed together with Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen the Hohenzollernsche Lande .
The ulna is one of the two long bones in the forearm , the other being the radius . It is prismatic in form and runs parallel to the radius , which is shorter and smaller . In anatomical position ( i.e. when the palms of the hands face forward ) the ulna is located at the side of the forearm closest to the body ( the medial side ) , the side of the little finger . The corresponding bone in the leg is the fibula . The ulna is broader proximally , and narrower distally . Proximally , the ulna has a bony process , the olecranon process , a hook-like structure that fits into the olecranon fossa of the humerus . This prevents hyperextension and forms a hinge joint with the trochlea of the humerus . There is also a radial notch for the head of the radius , and the ulnar tuberosity to which muscles attach . At the distal end of the ulna is a styloid process . The long , narrow medullary cavity is enclosed in a strong wall of compact tissue which is thickest along the interosseous border and dorsal surface . At the extremities the compact layer thins . The compact layer is continued onto the back of the olecranon as a plate of close spongy bone with lamellÃ parallel . From the inner surface of this plate and the compact layer below it trabeculÃ arch forward toward the olecranon and coronoid and cross other trabeculÃ , passing backward over the medullary cavity from the upper part of the shaft below the coronoid . Below the coronoid process there is a small area of compact bone from which trabeculÃ curve upward to end obliquely to the surface of the semilunar notch which is coated with a thin layer of compact bone . The trabeculÃ at the lower end have a more longitudinal direction . In four-legged animals , the radius is the main load-bearing bone of the lower forelimb , and the ulna is important primarily for muscular attachment . In many mammals , the ulna is partially or wholly fused with the radius , and may therefore not exist as a separate bone . However , even in extreme cases of fusion , such as in horses , the olecranon process is still present , albeit as a projection from the upper radius .

Warren Street tube station is a London Underground station , located at the intersection of Tottenham Court Road and Euston Road . It is on the branch of the Northern Line , between and , and the Victoria Line between and Euston . It is in Travelcard Zone 1 and is the nearest tube station to University College Hospital , being opposite the newly opened main building . It is also very close to on the Circle , Hammersmith and City and Metropolitan lines . The station opened as part of the original Charing Cross , Euston & Hampstead Railway on June 22 , 1907 under the name `` Euston Road '' , and this name can still be seen in the Northern Line platform tiling . The platforms were built on the outside of the running lines . The station 's name changed to `` Warren Street '' the following year . The current station building replaced the original when escalators were installed . The Victoria Line platforms opened on December 1 , 1968 . At the next station northwards , Euston , there is cross-platform interchange between the Northbound Victoria line and Northbound Northern line ( Bank branch ) ; and Southbound Victoria line and Southbound Northern line ( Bank branch ) . To facilitate this , the Victoria line tracks had to switch from the standard left-hand running to right-hand , making the cross-platform interchange in reality in opposite directions , as both lines run east-west at this point . Warren Street also has right-hand running due to its proximity to Euston . The Victoria line platforms at King 's Cross St. Pancras ( the next station on from Euston ) also displays this feature for the same reason . Due to the right-hand running on the Victoria line and the Northern line having side platforms , the doors open on the left on all four platforms . The Northern Line northbound platform of the station was used for location filming in the movie Death Line ( 1972 ) .

Dinner used to be the name of the main meal of the day . Depending upon culture , this may now be the second , third or fourth meal of the day . but , originally , it referred to the first meal of the day , eaten about noon , and is still occasionally used in this fashion if it refers to a large or main meal . Originally , dinner referred to the first meal of a two-meal day , a heavy meal occurring about noon , which broke the night 's fast in the new day . The word is from the Old French ( ca 1300 ) disner , meaning `` breakfast '' , from the stem of Gallo-Romance desjunare ( `` to break one 's fast '' ) , from Latin dis - ( `` undo '' ) + Late Latin ieiunare ( `` to fast '' ) , from Latin ieiunus ( `` fasting , hungry '' ) . Eventually , the term shifted to referring to the heavy main meal of the day , even if it had been preceded by a breakfast meal . The ( lighter ) meal following dinner has traditionally been referred to as supper or tea . In some usages , the term dinner has continued to refer to the largest meal of the day , even when this meal is eaten at the end of the day and is preceded by two other meals . In this terminology , the preceding meals are usually referred to as breakfast and lunch . In some areas , this leads to a variable name for meals depending on the combination of their size and the time of day , while in others meal names are fixed based on the time they are consumed . However , even in systems in which dinner is the meal usually eaten at the end of the day , an individual dinner may still refer to a main or more sophisticated meal at any time in the day , such as a banquet , feast , or a special meal eaten on a Sunday .
In earthquake engineering , vibration control is a set of technical means aimed to mitigate seismic impacts in building and non-building structures . When ground seismic waves reach up and start to penetrate a base of a building , their energy flow density , due to reflections , reduces dramatically : usually , up to 90 % . However , the remaining portions of the incident waves during a major earthquake still bear a huge devastating potential . Devices of the last kind , abbreviated correspondingly as TMD for the tuned ( passive ) , as AMD for the active , and as HMD for the hybrid mass dampers , have been studied and installed in high-rise buildings , predominantly in Japan , for a quarter of a century . However , there is quite another approach : partial suppression of the seismic energy flow into the superstructure known as seismic or base isolation which has been implemented in a number of historical buildings all over the world and remains in the focus of earthquake engineering research for years . For this , some pads are inserted into all major load-carrying elements in the base of the building which should substantially decouple a superstructure from its substructure resting on a shaking ground . It also requires creating a rigidity diaphragm and a moat around the building , as well as making provisions against overturning and P-delta effect .

The Bashkir language ( self-designation : Bashkort , ( bÉ ` Ê qort tÉ lÉ ) ) is a Turkic language , and is the language of the Bashkirs . It is co-official with Russian in the Republic of Bashkortostan . Speakers of the Bashkir language mostly live in the Russian republic of Bashkortostan . Many speakers also live in Chelyabinsk , Orenburg , Sverdlovsk , Samara and Kurgan Oblasts , Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrugâ '' Yugra , Tatarstan and Udmurtia . Minor Bashkir minority groups also live in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan . The modern Bashkir language is part of the Kipchak group of Turkic languages . Today the language has three dialects : Eastern , Southern and North-western . Bashkirs formerly used the Chagatay language as a written language . In the late 19th century it was replaced with a regional variety of Turki , a literary Turkic language , which was in use until 1923 . Both Chagatay and Turki were written in a variant of the Arabic script . In 1923 , a writing system based on the Arabic script was specifically created for the Bashkir language . At the same time , a Bashkir literary language was created , moving away from the older written Turkic influences . At first , it used a modified Arabic alphabet . In 1930 it was replaced with a Latin-based alphabet , which was in turn replaced with an adapted Cyrillic alphabet in the winter of 1938 .
Janet Michelle `` Jan '' Kerouac ( February 16 , 1952 -- June 5 , 1996 ) was an American writer and the only child of beat generation author Jack Kerouac and Joan Haverty Kerouac . Kerouac was born in Albany , New York . Her mother left her father while pregnant , and Jack refused to acknowledge the baby as his daughter . A blood test when Jan was nine years old proved his paternity and he was ordered to pay $ 52 a week for her upbringing . Though Jan met her father only twice , she inherited his wanderlust , and like both her parents , Jan made frequent use of drugs and was no stranger to trouble . After a teenage stint in a mental hospital , Jan delved deeper into the 1960s underworld of drugs , before leaving for Mexico at the age of fifteen . For the next few decades , she traveled across the country with a reckless abandon that echoed that of her father and Neal Cassady . She published two semi-autobiographical novels , Baby Driver in 1981 , and Trainsong in 1988 . She was working on a third novel , Parrot Fever , at the time of her death . During this time , Kerouac was also involved in legal battles with Stella Sampas Kerouac , Jack 's last wife ; and after Stella 's death , with Stella 's blood relatives , over his estate , including the location of his grave and ownership of his papers . On July 24 , 2009 , a judge in Pinellas County , Florida ruled that the will of his mother Gabrielle Kerouac ( died 1973 ) , which gave all rights to Jack Kerouac 's work to the Sampas family , was a forgery . The legal action against this will was originally brought by Jan Kerouac and a nephew of Jack 's . It is not clear whether the judge 's ruling would affect the distribution of assets of the estate . A lawyer for the Sampas family , George Tobias , commented that he expected the ruling to be appealed . He did not explain how this would occur , since the family was not directly involved in the lawsuit . Married and divorced twice , Kerouac lived a troubled life marked by periods of self-destruction . In 1968 , she gave birth to a stillborn child and had no other children . On June 5 , 1996 , Kerouac died in Albuquerque , New Mexico following surgery . She is survived by twin half-sisters , Katharine and Sharon , and one half-brother , David Bowers . Author Gerald Nicosia , who at one time was Jan Kerouac 's personal literary representative , has edited and published a book of tributes to her , entitled Jan Kerouac : A Life in Memory in January 2009 .
The pope either decides the case himself or delegates the decision to another tribunal , usually one of the tribunals or congregations of the Roman Curia .

The Secretary is appointed by the President with the approval of the Senate , and is a member of the Cabinet and the National Security Council . Per federal law , a person may not be appointed as Secretary of Defense within seven years after relief from active duty as a commissioned officer of a regular component of an armed force . The Secretary of Defense earns a salary of $ 191,300 per year . The Army , Navy , and Marine Corps were established in 1775 , in concurrence with the American Revolution . The War Department was established in 1789 , and was the precursor to what is now the Department of Defense . In 1790 , the Coast Guard was established as part of Homeland Security during peacetime . This was followed by the founding of the Department of the Navy in 1798 . The decision to unify the different services under one Department led to the creation of the National Military Establishment in 1947 . This establishment would replace the War Department , which was converted to the Department of the Army . That same year , the U.S. Air Force was established , followed by the founding of the Department of the Air Force . The newly created Air Force was merged into the National Military Establishment In 1949 , an amendment to the National Security Act further consolidated the national defense structure in order to reduce interservice rivalry by withdrawing Cabinet-level status from the three Service secretaries . The National Military Establishment was then renamed the Department of Defense . The three military branches , Army , Navy , and Air Force , were officially placed under the direct control of the newly created position of the Secretary of Defense , confirmed by Senate . In the U.S. Armed Forces , the Secretary of Defense is often referred to as SecDef or SD . The Secretary of Defense and the President together constitute the National Command Authorities ( NCA ) , which has sole authority to launch strategic nuclear weapons . All nuclear weapons are governed by this dual-authority - both must concur before a strategic nuclear strike may be ordered . The Secretary 's staff element is called the Office of the Secretary of Defense and is composed of a Deputy Secretary of Defense and five Under Secretaries of Defense in the fields of Acquisition , Technology & Logistics ; Comptroller\/Chief Financial Officer ; Intelligence ; Personnel & Readiness ; and Policy . The Secretary of Defense by statute also exercises authority , direction and control over the three Secretaries of the Military Departments ( Secretary of the Army , Secretary of the Navy & Secretary of the Air Force ) , the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Army Chief of Staff , Commandant of the Marine Corps , Chief of Naval Operations & Air Force Chief of Staff ) , the Combatant Commanders of the Unified Combatant Commands , the Directors of the Defense Agencies ( for example the Director of the National Security Agency ) and of the DoD Field Activities . All of these high-ranking positions require Senate confirmation . Along with the Secretary of State , the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury , the Secretary of Defense is generally regarded as one of the Big Four important cabinet officials . The longest-serving Secretary of Defense is Robert McNamara , who served for a total of 2,595 days . The Secretary of Defense is sixth in the presidential line of succession . In of March 1 , 2010 , President Barack Obama modified the line of succession regarding who would act as Secretary of Defense in the event of a vacancy or incapacitation , thus reversing the changes made by President George W. Bush in as to the relative positions of the Secretaries of the Military Departments :
Christopher `` Kit '' Jeremiah Symons ( born 8 March 1971 , in Basingstoke , Hampshire , England ) is a former Welsh international footballer . A defender , Symons began his career at Portsmouth , spending seven years at the south coast club , making 160 appearances . He helped Portsmouth to the 1992 FA Cup semi final , but was the only Pompey player successful from the spot as they lost on a penalty shootout to Liverpool . In the summer of 1995 he transferred to Manchester City for a Â # 1.2 million fee . He played for The Citizens until 1998 when he moved to London club Fulham , on a free transfer , having made 124 appearances . He played for Fulham until 2001 , when he was signed by Crystal Palace for Â # 400,000 , the club at which he finished his playing career after 49 appearances . During his playing career Symons also won 36 caps for Wales , scoring twice . His last appearance for Wales was on 6 October 2001 against Belarus . Symons spent some of his time at Crystal Palace as a player-coach , and after retiring from playing became a full-time member of the coaching staff . He became caretaker player-manager for a short while in 2003 , and following the subsequent appointment of Iain Dowie he combined the roles of player and assistant manager . For the 2005 â `` 06 season , Symons was replaced by Neil McDonald as assistant manager , and was instead given the task of managing Crystal Palace 's reserve team , who played in the Premier Reserve Southern League until the end of the 2005 â `` 06 season ( The side will play in the Pontin 's Holiday Combination League for the 2006 â `` 07 season , following changes that meant only Premier League teams can have a reserve team in the Premier Reserve League ) . Following the departure of both Iain Dowie and Neil McDonald in the summer of 2006 , Symons was named First-Team Coach under new manager Peter Taylor . The title of Assistant Manager was not given to anyone , but it was instead seen that Symons had the role closest to assistant . After Taylor was dismissed from the Eagles on 8 October 2007 , Symons was confirmed as Caretaker Manager until the appointment of Neil Warnock three days later ( Palace did not play during this time ) . Following Warnock 's appointment , Symons stepped down from his position of Assistant Manager and left the club on 15 October . Kit joined Colchester United on 16 January 2008 following Micky Adams ' resignation as assistant the previous week . He was appointed as Colchester 's caretaker-manager in September 2008 after the departure of Geraint Williams . He has since been employed by Fulham as Senior Scout and Academy Coach .
Mycobacterium leprae , also known as Hansenâ s coccus spirilly , mostly found in warm tropical countries , is a bacterium that causes leprosy ( Hansen 's disease ) . It is an intracellular , pleomorphic , acid-fast bacterium . M. leprae is an aerobic rod-shaped ( bacillus ) surrounded by the characteristic waxy coating unique to mycobacteria . In size and shape , it closely resembles Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Due to its thick waxy coating , M. leprae stains with a carbol fuscin rather than with the traditional Gram stain . The culture takes several weeks to mature . Optical microscopy shows M. leprae in clumps , rounded masses , or in groups of bacilli side by side . It was discovered in 1873 by the Norwegian physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen , who was searching for the bacteria in the skin nodules of patients with leprosy . It was the first bacterium to be identified as causing disease in humans . The organism has never been successfully grown on an artificial cell culture media . Instead it has been grown in mouse foot pads and more recently in nine-banded armadillos because they , like humans , are susceptible to leprosy . This can be used as a diagnostic test for the presence of bacillus in body lesions of suspected leprosy patients . The difficulty in culturing the organism appears to be because the organism is an obligate intracellular parasite that lacks many necessary genes for independent survival . The complex and unique cell wall that makes members of the Mycobacterium genus difficult to destroy is apparently also the reason for the extremely slow replication rate . Virulence factors include a waxy exterior coating , formed by the production of mycolic acids unique to Mycobacterium . M. leprae was sensitive to dapsone ( diaminodiphenylsulfone , the first effective treatment which was discovered for leprosy in the 1940s ) , but resistance against this antibiotic has developed over time . Therapy with dapsone alone is now strongly contraindicated . Currently , a multidrug treatment ( MDT ) is recommended by the World Health Organization , including dapsone , rifampicin and clofazimine . In patients receiving the MDT , a high proportion of the bacilli die within a short amount of time without immediate relief of symptoms . This suggests that many symptoms of leprosy must be due in part to the presence of dead cells . Mycobacterium leprae has the longest doubling time of all known bacteria and has thwarted every effort at culture in the laboratory . Comparing the genome sequence of Mycobacterium leprae with that of Mycobacterium tuberculosis provides clear explanations for these properties and reveal an extreme case of reductive evolution . Less than half of the genome contains functional genes . Gene deletion and decay appear to have eliminated many important metabolic activities , including siderophore production , part of the oxidative and most of the microaerophilic and anaerobic respiratory chains , and numerous catabolic systems and their regulatory circuits . The genome sequence of a strain of M. leprae , originally isolated in Tamil Nadu and designated TN , has been completed recently . The sequence was obtained by a combined approach , employing automated DNA sequence analysis of selected cosmids and whole-genome ` shotgun ' clones . After the finishing process , the genome sequence was found to contain 3,268,203 base pairs ( bp ) , and to have an average G+C content of 57.8 % , values much lower than the corresponding values for M. tuberculosis , which are 4 , 441,529 bp and 65.6 % G+C . There are 1500 genes which are common to both M. leprae and M. tuberculosis . The comparative analysis suggests that both mycobacteria derived from a common ancestor and , at one stage , had gene pools of similar size . Downsizing from a genome of 4.42 Mb , such as that of M. tuberculosis , to one of 3.27 Mb would account for the loss of some 1200 protein coding sequences . There is evidence that many of the genes that were present in the genome of the common ancestor of M. leprae and M. tuberculosis have been lost by recombination in the M. leprae genome . Information from the completed genome can be useful to develop diagnostic skin tests , understanding the mechanism of nerve damage , drug resistance and to identify novel drug targets for rational design of new therapeutic regimens and drugs to treat leprosy and its complications . Diagnostic criteria for leprosy : The diagnosis of leprosy is primarily a clinical one . In one Ethiopian study , the following criteria had a sensitivity of 97 % with a positive predictive value of 98 % in diagnosing leprosy . Diagnosis was based on 1 or more of 3 signs : 1 ) Hypopigmented or reddish patches with definite loss of sensation 2 ) Thickened peripheral nerves 3 ) Acid-fast bacilli on skin smears or biopsy material
The free concert consists of local and national bands performing alongside various stalls showcasing local businesses . Mickey 's House of Villains is a direct-to-video film produced by The Walt Disney Company . It is a film adaptation of the Disney Channel animated television series Disney 's House of Mouse , starring Mickey Mouse , Donald Duck , Minnie Mouse , Goofy , Daisy Duck and Disney Villains that have appeared in past Disney productions . It was released on both VHS and DVD by Walt Disney Home Video on September 3 , 2002 . It is Halloween night at the House of Mouse , and a lot of villains are showing up . Jafar has a trick in store for the usual heroes of the House , but the villains have to wait until midnight for him to unleash it . After a series of cartoons , Jafar , along with Captain Hook , Cruella de Vil , Ursula and Hades , takes over the house with a musical number `` It 's Our House Now ! '' All the other villains soon join the gang . The heroes are trapped in the kitchen while Mickey and several others are thrown out into the street . They witness the House 's name being changed to the House of Villains . Mickey , Donald , Goofy and Minnie try to take their House back , but Chernabog keeps them from entering the building . Then , Mickey dresses in his sorcerer outfit from Fantasia ( and Fantasia 2000 ) and challenges Jafar to a magical duel using fireballs . Just when Mickey 's sorcerer hat is knocked off , Aladdin escapes from the kitchen , flying on the magic carpet and gives Daisy Duck the magical lamp . Daisy hands it to Mickey who uses the lamp to suck Jafar into it . The rest of the villains flee and the House of Mouse is restored . Like the show , the film shows several Disney cartoons . In fact , these shorts make up more of the movie than the actual plot with the villains . However , all their title cards are edited out .
Petroleum coke ( often abbreviated Pet coke or petcoke ) is a carbonaceous solid derived from oil refinery coker units or other cracking processes . Other coke has traditionally been derived from coal . Marketable coke is coke that is relatively pure carbon and can be sold for use as fuel ( i.e. fuel grade coke ) , or for the manufacture of dry cells , electrodes , etc. ( i.e. , anode grade coke ) . Needle coke , also called acicular coke , is a highly crystalline petroleum coke used in the production of electrodes for the steel and aluminium industries and is particularly valuable because the electrodes must be replaced regularly and Needle coke is produced exclusively from sweet crude oil , which is in diminishing supply . Catalyst coke is coke that has deposited on the catalysts used in oil refining , such as those in a fluid catalytic cracker . This coke is impure and is only used for fuel . Fuel Grade Coke is classified as either sponge coke or shot coke morphology . While oil refiners have been producing coke for well over 100 years , the mechanisms that cause sponge coke or shot coke to form are not well understood and can not be accurately predicted . In general , lower temperatures and higher pressures promote sponge coke formation . Additionally , the amount of heptane insolubles present , and fraction of light components in the coker feed contribute . Its high heat and low ash content make it a good fuel for power generation in coal fired boilers , but petroleum coke is high in sulfur and low in volatile content which pose some environmental and technical problems with its combustion . In order to meet current North American emissions standards some form of sulfur capture is required , a common choice of sulfur recovering unit for burning petroleum coke is the SNOX Flue gas desulphurisation technology , which is based on the well-known WSA Process . Fluidized bed combustion is commonly used to burn petroleum coke . Gasification is increasingly used with this feedstock ( often using gasifiers placed in the refineries themselves ) . Calcined petroleum coke ( CPC ) is the product from calcining petroleum coke . This coke is the product of the coker unit in a crude oil refinery . The calcined petroleum coke is used to make anodes for the aluminium , steel and titanium smelting industry . The green coke must have sufficiently low metals content in order to be used as anode material . Green coke with this low metals content is referred to as anode grade coke . The green coke with too high metals content will not be calcined and is used for burning . This green coke is called fuel grade coke .

The total area is 139.76 kmÂ , giving a population density of 52.5 inhabitants per kmÂ . Vielsalm ( meaning `` old Salm '' , to distinguish it from a newer settlement that was later abandoned ) takes its name from that of the River Salm . It is the place of origin of the princely House of Salm . In World War II , the 75th Infantry Division of the U.S. Army , 575th Signal Co. , maintained its command post in the town from January 19-22 , 1945 , as it counterattacked against the German army .
Rubens JosuÃ da Costa ( 24 November 1928 -- 31 May 1991 ) was a Brazilian football player . He was included in the Brazil national football team squad at the 1954 FIFA World Cup finals . Rubens played club football for Ypiranga-SP , Flamengo , Vasco da Gama , Portuguesa Desportos , Santa Cruz-PE , Prudentina-SP , Ourinhos-SP and Bragantino-SP , winning the Campeonato Carioca in 1953 , 1954 and 1955 with Flamengo and in 1958 with Vasco da Gama .
Rana Mohammad Hanif Khan ( Urdu , Punjabi : Ø Ø Ù Ø Ù Ø Ù Ø Ø Ù Û Ù Ø Ø Ù ) , simply referred to as Rana Hanif , was the Finance Minister of Pakistan from October 22 , 1974 to March 28 , 1977 . He was from the city of Sahiwal , which is in the Punjab province of Pakistan . Khan was born the second oldest child of five in 1922 , to a Punjabi Muslim family of Rajput background , in pre-partition India . His family hailed from the town of Garhshanker in Punjab 's Hoshiarpur district , and like thousands of other Muslim families , migrated to the newly-created Pakistan after the partition of India . He settled along with his family in the city of Montgomery , which later became known as Sahiwal . In the 1950s , Khan left for London to complete a bar-at-law , thereby becoming a qualified barrister . His first few years of profession were spent practicing law in Sahiwal and it was from local support here that he was initially encouraged to take a stand in politics . Prior to his entrance in politics , he developed friendly contacts with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto , Pakistan 's Prime-Minister-to-be . After the Peoples Party 's success in elections , he was advocated the position of the Finance Minister under the new Bhutto government .

Sigma ( upper case Î # , lower case Ï , lower case in word-final position Ï ; Greek Ï Î Î Î 1\/4 Î ) is the eighteenth letter of the Greek alphabet , and carries the 'S ' sound . In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 200 . When used at the end of a word , and the word is not all upper case , the final form ( Ï ) is used , e.g. á 1\/2 Î Ï Ï Ï Î Ï Ï ( Odysseus ) - note the two sigmas in the center of the name , and the word-final sigma at the end . It is not to be confused with the cedilla Ã . The shape and alphabetic position of Sigma is derived from Phoenician shin ð '' . The name of sigma , according to one theory , may continue that of Phoenician Samekh . According to a different theory , its original name may have been `` San '' ( the name today associated with another , obsolete letter ) , while `` Sigma '' was a Greek innovation that simply meant `` hissing '' , based on a nominalization of a verb ( sÃ zÅ , from earlier \* sig-j Å , meaning ' I hiss ' ) . The uppercase form of sigma was re-borrowed into the Latin alphabet to serve as the uppercase of modern esh ( lowercase : Ê ) . In handwritten Greek during the Hellenistic period ( 4th and 3rd centuries BC ) , the epigraphic form of Î # was simplified into a C-like shape . It is also found on coins from the fourth century BC onwards . This became the universal standard form of Sigma during late antiquity and the Middle Ages . It is today known as lunate sigma ( upper case Ï , lower case Ï ) , because of its crescent-like shape . It is still widely used in decorative typefaces in Greece , especially in religious and church contexts , as well as in some modern print editions of classical Greek texts . The forms of the Cyrillic letter Ð ( representing \/ s \/ ) and Coptic letter sima are derived from lunate sigma . A dotted lunate sigma ( sigma periestigmenon , encoded at U +03 FE Ï 3\/4 ) was used by Aristarchus of Samothrace as an editorial sign indicating that the line so marked is at an incorrect position . Similarly , an antisigma or reversed sigma ( Ï 1\/2 ) may mark a line that is out of place . A dotted antisigma or dotted reversed sigma ( antisigma periestigmenon : Ï ) may indicate a line after which rearrangements should be made , or to variant readings of uncertain priority . In both Ancient and Modern Greek , the sigma represents the voiceless alveolar fricative \/ s \/ . In Ancient Greek , this sound was voiced to \/ z \/ before \/ m \/ or \/ n \/ . Upper case Î # may be used in the Berber Latin alphabet for ( Ê ) , though the INALCO standard uses Æ instead . During the 1930s , an upper case Î # was in use as the symbol of the AÃ Ã # o Integralista Brasileira , a radical right-wing party in Brazil . There are several Unicode codepoints representing the Greek letter sigma . The use of multiple codepoints for final \/ non-final sigma is somewhat unusual in Unicode . However , the two can not always be distinguished by a simple algorithm ( there are exceptions for abbreviations ) , and there is a significant history of them being separate characters in other specifications . Additionally , there are at least 23 codepoints for sigma as a symbol ( bold , italic , sans-serif , lunate , reversed , or dotted , in various combinations ) .
Thomas Michael Keneally , AO ( born 7 October 1935 ) is an Australian novelist , playwright and author of non-fiction . He is best known for writing Schindler 's Ark , the Booker Prize winning novel of 1982 which was inspired by the efforts of Poldek Pfefferberg , a Holocaust survivor . The book would later be adapted to Steven Spielberg 's Schindler 's List , which won the Academy Award for Best Picture . Born in Sydney , Keneally was educated at St Patrick 's College , Strathfield , where a writing prize was named after him . He entered St Patrick 's Seminary , Manly to train as a Catholic priest but left before his ordination . He worked as a Sydney schoolteacher before his success as a novelist , and he was a lecturer at the University of New England ( 1968 â `` 70 ) . He has also written screenplays , memoirs and non-fiction books . Keneally was known as `` Mick '' until 1964 but began using the name Thomas when he started publishing , after advice from his publisher to use what was really his first name . He is most famous for his Schindler 's Ark ( 1982 ) ( later republished as Schindler 's List ) , which won the Booker Prize and is the basis of the film Schindler 's List . Many of his novels are reworkings of historical material , although modern in their psychology and style . Keneally has also acted in a handful of films . He had a small role in The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith ( based on his novel ) and played Father Marshall in the Fred Schepisi movie , The Devil 's Playground ( 1976 ) ( not to be confused with a similarly-titled documentary by Lucy Walker about the Amish rite of passage called rumspringa ) . In 1983 he was made an Officer of the Order of Australia ( AO ) . He is an Australian Living Treasure . He is a strong advocate of the Australian republic , meaning the severing of all ties with the British monarchy , and published a book on the subject Our Republic in 1993 . Several of his Republican essays appear on the web site of the Australian Republican Movement . Keneally is a keen supporter of rugby league football , in particular the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles club of the NRL . in 2004 he gave the 6th annual Tom Brock Lecture . He made an appearance in the 2007 rugby league drama film The Final Winter . In March 2009 , the Prime Minister of Australia , Kevin Rudd , gave an autographed copy of Keneally 's Lincoln biography to President Barack Obama as a state gift . Most recently Thomas Keneally featured as a writer in the critically acclaimed Australian drama , `` Our Sunburnt Country '' . Thomas Keneally 's nephew Ben is married to the NSW Premier , Kristina Keneally . Keneally wrote the Booker Prize-winning novel in 1982 , inspired by the efforts of Poldek Pfefferberg , a Holocaust survivor . In 1980 Pfefferberg met Keneally in his shop , and learning that he was a novelist , showed him his extensive files on Oskar Schindler . Keneally was interested , and Pfefferberg became an advisor for the book , accompanying Keneally to Poland where they visited KrakÃ w and the sites associated with the Schindler story . Keneally dedicated Schindler 's Ark to Pfefferberg : `` who by zeal and persistence caused this book to be written . '' He said in an interview in 2007 that what attracted him to Oskar Schindler was that `` it was the fact that you could n't say where opportunism ended and altruism began . And I like the subversive fact that the spirit breatheth where it will . That is , that good will emerged from the most unlikely places '' . The book was later made into a film titled Schindler 's List ( 1993 ) directed by Steven Spielberg , earning the director his first Best Director Oscar . Keneally 's meeting with Pfefferberg and their research tours are detailed in Searching for Schindler : A Memoir ( 2007 ) . Some of the Pfefferberg documents that inspired Keneally are now housed in the State Library of New South Wales in Sydney . In 1996 the State Library purchased this material from a private collector . In April 2009 a copy of the list ( including 801 names ) was found in the documentation Thomas Keneally used as research material for his novel .

For the sound in English sometimes represented by Ä , see near-close near-front unrounded vowel . Short I ( Ð Ð ; italics : Ð Ð ) is a letter of the Cyrillic alphabet . It is made of the Cyrillic letter Ð with a breve . Short I represents the palatal approximant \/ j \/ , like the pronunciation of â yâ in toy . It is transliterated as â jâ ( used amongst European languages ) , â yâ ( the most common ) , or â iâ ( the least common , likely to be Ä ) , depending on which romanization system is used . See Transliteration of Russian into English and Romanization of Ukrainian . Active use of â Ð â ( or , rather , the breve over â Ð â ) began around the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries . Since the middle of the seventeenth century , the differentiation between â Ð â and â Ð â has become obligatory in the Russian variant of Church Slavonic orthography ( used for the Russian language as well ) . During the alphabet reforms of Peter I , all diacritic marks were removed from the Russian writing system , but shortly after his death in 1735 , the distinction between â Ð â and â Ð â was restored . â Ð â was not officially considered a separate letter of the alphabet until the 1930s . In Russian , Short I appears predominantly in diphthongs like \/ ij \/ in Ñ Ð Ñ Ð 3\/4 Ð Ð Ð ( shirokiy ` wide ' ) , \/ aj \/ in Ð Ñ Ð Ð ( kray ` end ' , ` krai ' ) , \/ ej \/ in Ð Ð 3\/4 Ð '' Ð Ð ( doley ` portion ' ) , \/ oj \/ in Ð Ð 3\/4 Ñ Ð 3\/4 Ð ( goroy ` mountain ' ) , and \/ uj \/ in Ð Ñ Ð Ñ Ñ Ð Ð 3\/4 ( buystvo ` rage ' ) . It is used in other positions only in foreign words , such as Ð opÐ ( York ) , or even fellow Slavic words like Ð oÐ oÐ Ð Ñ ( Yovovich ) . In Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian , the Cyrillic letter Ð is used to represent the same sound . Latin-based Slavonic writing systems such as Polish , Czech and the Latin version of Serbian and Croatian use the Latin letter J ( not the letter Y , as in English or French ) for that purpose .

Page 44 are an indie rock band formed in Birmingham , England in 2004 . They have played on national TV , namely Channel 4 's Popworld , where they were interviewed by Alex Zane as well as performing live to over half a million viewers . They made their appearance on the show because the show 's viewers voted their song `` The Grey Room '' as their favorite at the time . They have opened for bands such as Boy Kill Boy , Captain Phoenix , & The Standards . BBC said the band might become `` tomorrow 's superstars '' . In 2006 , they came in 2nd out of 1,000 bands in the national Emergenza live band competition . In 2007 , the band was crowned the best unsigned band in the Midlands . The band won the title of Carling Supports Champions for Birmingham again in October 2007 . In 2006 , they were crowned Champions of the Midlands Emergenza Live Band competition and went on to finish second in the Emergenza UK National Final . The competition , which was judged by Sony , Universal , Interscope , and NME , took place in London . Many fans discovered Page 44 after downloading the song `` We Know The Way '' , ( improperly credited to +44 on P2P networks such as Kazaa and Limewire . ) When asked about what genre Page 44 falls into , Adam Stanford has said the band 's music spans over many genres , from alternative rock to indie , and has described their overall sound as `` energetic rock '' . Page 44 falls into many other subgenres , such as Powerpop . The current lineup includes Adam Stanford on Guitar and Vocals , Adam `` Viggy '' Vygus on lead Vocals and Guitar , Zach Phelps on Bass and backup vocals , & Mark Rabone joined the band as drummer . Rabone joined the band on 9 February 2008 . The original bassist Paul Bugden left in 2005 , and was replaced by Samuel Wilson . The original drummer , Elliot Vaughan had a falling out with the band and left in 2007 . Shortly after , he was replaced by Laurent `` Lozz '' Gillgrass , who left the band in early 2008 . In 2009 , Bassist and backing vocalist Samuel Wilson left the band to attend college , and was replaced by Zach Phelps .

The decomposition of dinitrogen pentoxide produces the highly toxic nitrogen dioxide gas . Nitrogen trichloride , also known as trichloramine , is the chemical compound with the formula NCl3 . This yellow , oily , pungent-smelling liquid is most commonly encountered as a byproduct of chemical reactions between ammonia-derivatives and chlorine ( for example , in swimming pools between disinfecting chlorine and urea in urine from bathers ) . In pure form , NCl3 is highly reactive . Nitrogen trichloride can form in small amounts when public water supplies are disinfected with monochloramine , and at given levels it can irritate mucous membranes . Nitrogen trichloride was trademarked as Agene and used to artificially bleach and age flour . It has the same effect as that of tear gas , but has never been used as such . 4 NH3 + 3 Cl2 NCl3 + 3 NH4Cl Intermediates in this conversion include chloramine and dichloramine , NH2Cl and NHCl2 , respectively . Like ammonia , NCl3 is a pyramidal molecule . The N-Cl distances are 1.76 Ã , and the Cl-N-Cl angles are 107 Â . The Pauling electronegativities are very similar for nitrogen ( 3.04 ) and chlorine ( 3.16 ) . The nitrogen in NCl3 is often considered to have the -3 oxidation state and the chlorine atoms are considered to be in the +1 oxidation state . Most of its reactivity is consistent with this description . Nitrogen trichloride is hydrolyzed by hot water to release ammonia and hypochlorous acid . NCl3 + 3 H2O NH3 + 3 HOCl Nitrogen trichloride is a dangerous explosive , being sensitive to light , heat , and organic compounds . Pierre Louis Dulong first prepared it in 1812 , and lost two fingers and an eye in two separate explosions . An explosion from NCl3 blinded Sir Humphry Davy temporarily , inducing him to hire Michael Faraday as a co-worker .

The Scottish Green Party is the Green party of Scotland . It currently has two MSPs in the devolved Scottish Parliament , Robin Harper , representing the Lothians , and Patrick Harvie , for Glasgow . The Scottish party is fully independent , and works closely with the other green parties of the United Kingdom and Ireland : the Green Party of England and Wales , the Green Party in Northern Ireland and the Green Party of Ireland . It is a full member of the European Green Party . The party currently has eight councillors : three in Edinburgh and five in Glasgow , all elected in 2007 . There are also two members of the party sitting as Democratic Independent councillors in Aberdeenshire , both of whom defected from the Scottish Liberal Democrats in 2009 . At the 2005 Westminster election , the party contested 19 seats and gained 25,760 votes . Its top result was 7.7 % of the vote in Glasgow North , a major breakthrough in the West of Scotland . In the European Parliament election of 2004 , it missed out on a seat with 6.8 % of the vote . However , the Party lost 5 of their 7 seats in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election . According to accounts filed with the Electoral Commission for the year ending December 31 , 2008 , the party had an income of about Â # 76,597 that year , and expenditure of around Â # 57,000 and a membership of 998 . The Scottish Green Party was a constituent part of the former UK Green Party until 1990 , when the Scottish Green Party became a separate entity . The separation was entirely amicable , as part of the green commitment to decentralisation : the Scottish Green Party supports a referendum on Scottish independence . The Scottish Green Party benefits from the fact that the British government created a Scottish Parliament , which is elected using the additional member system of proportional representation . In the first election to this Parliament , in 1999 , the Scottish Green Party got one Member of the Scottish Parliament ( MSP ) elected by proportional representation , Robin Harper , the UK 's first Green Parliamentarian . On 1 May 2003 the Scottish Greens added six new MSPs to their previous total . In the 2007 elections , the Party lost five seats in Holyrood . However in the council elections , taking place under the new Single Transferable Vote voting system , they gained three Councillors on the City of Edinburgh Council and five Councillors on Glasgow City Council . On 11 May 2007 , the Greens signed an agreement with the Scottish National Party , which meant that the Greens voted for Alex Salmond as First Minister and supported his initial Ministerial appointments . In return , the Nationalists backed a climate change bill as an early measure and promised to legislate against ship-to-ship oil transfers in the Firth of Forth . The SNP also agreed to nominate Patrick Harvie , one of the Green MSPs , to convene one of the Holyrood committees : Transport , Infrastructure and Climate Change . On 28 January 2009 , the two Green MSPs were instrumental in the defeat of the Government 's budget , though a slightly amended version was passed easily the following week . On 31 May 2009 , Cllr Martin Ford , formerly a Liberal Democrat , joined the Scottish Green Party in protest to the plans by Donald Trump to develop on an important environmental site at Menie . On 13 October 2009 , he was joined by fellow former Liberal Democrat Cllr Debra Storr . Both Councillors continue to serve on Aberdeenshire Council as members of the Democratic Independent group . According to the party 's website , current policy is guided by the party 's 2005 Westminster election , 2007 Holyrood election , and 2009 European election manifestos . The party claims that , taken together , these principles give the party a holistic view that is in common with all Green parties around the world . All of the Scottish Green Party 's Members of the Scottish Parliament ( MSPs ) have been elected under the list or `` top-up '' system of representation in the Parliament . Prior to the 2007 elections , the Party had only ever elected one councillor at local level : in May 1990 , Roger ( aka Rory ) Winter , representing the Highland Green Party ( Uainich na GÃ idhealtachd ) , was elected in Nairn as Scotland 's first Green regional councillor to the then Highland Regional Council . Cllr Winter broke away from the Greens in 1991 and continued his four-year term as an Independent Green Highlander .

Peppermint ( Mentha Ã -- piperita , also known as M. balsamea Willd . ) is a hybrid mint , a cross between the watermint ( Mentha aquatica ) and spearmint ( Mentha spicata ) . The plant , indigenous to Europe , is now widespread in cultivation throughout all regions of the world . It is found wild occasionally with its parent species . Peppermint was first described in 1753 by Carolus Linnaeus from specimens that had been collected in England ; he treated it as a species , but it is now universally agreed to be a hybrid . It is a herbaceous rhizomatous perennial plant growing to 30 - tall , with smooth stems , square in cross section . The rhizomes are wide-spreading , fleshy , and bare fibrous roots . The leaves are from 4 - long and 1.5 - cm broad , dark green with reddish veins , and with an acute apex and coarsely toothed margins . The leaves and stems are usually slightly hairy . The flowers are purple , 6 - long , with a four-lobed corolla about 5 m diameter ; they are produced in whorls ( verticillasters ) around the stem , forming thick , blunt spikes . Flowering is from mid to late summer . The chromosome number is variable , with 2n counts of 66 , 72 , 84 , and 120 recorded . Peppermint typically occurs in moist habitats , including stream sides and drainage ditches . Being a hybrid , it is usually sterile , producing no seeds and reproducing only vegetatively , spreading by its rhizomes . If placed , it can grow anywhere , with a few exceptions . It is an invasive species in the Great Lakes region , noted since 1843 . The aroma of peppermint has been found to enhance memory . As such , it can be administered by instructors to their students before examinations , to aid recall . Peppermint has a long tradition of medicinal use , with archaeological evidence placing its use at least as far back as ten thousand years ago . Peppermint has a high menthol content , and is often used as tea and for flavoring ice cream , confectionery , chewing gum , and toothpaste . The oil also contains menthone and menthyl esters , particularly menthyl acetate . Dried peppermint typically has 0.3-0 .4 % of volatile oil containing menthol ( 29-48 % ) , menthone ( 20-31 % ) , menthyl acetate ( 3-10 % ) , menthofuran ( 1-7 % ) and many trace consituents including limonene , pulegone , eucalyptol , and pinene . It is the oldest and most popular flavor of mint-flavoured confectionery . Peppermint can also be found in some shampoos and soaps , which give the hair a minty scent and produce a cooling sensation on the skin . Used in this way , it has been known to help with insomnia . In 2007 , Italian investigators reported that 75 % of the patients in their study who took peppermint oil capsules for four weeks had a major reduction in irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) symptoms , compared with just 38 % of those who took a placebo . A second study in 2010 , conducted in Iran , found similar results . Similarly , some poorly designed earlier trials found that peppermint oil has the ability to reduce colicky abdominal pain due to IBS with an NNT ( number needed to treat ) around 3.1 , but the oil is an irritant to the stomach in the quantity required and therefore needs wrapping for delayed release in the intestine . This could also be achieved by using the whole herb or leaves rather than the volatile components alone . Peppermint relaxes the gastro-esophageal sphincter , thus promoting belching . Peppermint flowers are large nectar producers and honey bees as well as other nectar harvesting organisms forage them heavily . A mild , pleasant varietal honey can be produced if there is a sufficient area of plants . Peppermint oil has a high concentration of natural pesticides , mainly menthone . Outside of its native range , areas where peppermint was formerly grown for oil often have an abundance of feral plants , and it is considered invasive in Australia , the GalÃ pagos Islands , New Zealand , and in the United States . Peppermint generally thrives in moist , shaded locations , and expands quickly by underground stolons . It is often grown in containers to restrict rapid spreading . It grows best with a good supply of water , and is often planted in areas with part-sun to shade . The leaves and flowering tops are used , they are collected as soon as the flowers begin to open and then are carefully dried . The wild form of the plant is less suitable for this purpose , with cultivated plants having been selected for more and better oil content . Seeds sold at stores labeled peppermint generally will not germinate into true peppermint , but often produce a less intensely scented spearmint-like plant . The true peppermint rarely produce seeds , and only by fertilization from a spearmint plant , which contributes only their own spearmint genes that dilutes down the scent and flavor . The toxicity studies of the plant have received controversial results . Some authors reported that the plant may induce hepatic diseases ( liver disease ) , while others found that it protects against liver damage that is caused by heavy metals . In addition to that , the toxicities of the plant seem to vary from one cultivar to another and are dose dependent . This is probably attributed from the content level of pulegone . Some of the toxic components may come from herbicides . ,

Annie Edson Taylor ( October 24 , 1838 â `` April 29 , 1921 ) was an American adventurer who became the first person to survive a trip over Niagara Falls in a barrel on her 63rd birthday , October 24 , 1901 . Annie Edson Taylor was born on October 24th , 1838 in Auburn , New York . One of eight siblings , her father , Samuel Edson , owned a flour mill . He died when she was 12 years old but the money he left behind continued to provide a comfortable living for the family . She became a schoolteacher ( she received an honors degree in a four-year training course ) . During her studies she met David Taylor . They were married and had a son who died in infancy . Her husband was killed in the Civil War . After she was widowed , she spent her working years in between jobs and locales . Eventually , she ended up in Bay City , Michigan where she hoped to be a dance instructor . Since there were no dance schools in Bay City at that time , Taylor opened her own . Later she moved to Sault Ste . Marie in 1900 to teach music . From Sault Ste . Marie she traveled to San Antonio , Texas where she and a friend got together and went to Mexico City to find work . Unsuccessful , she returned to Bay City . Desiring to secure her later years financially , and avoid the poorhouse , she decided she would be the first person to ride over Niagara Falls in a barrel . Taylor used a custom-made barrel for her trip , constructed of oak and iron and padded with a mattress . Several delays occurred in the launching of the barrel , particularly because no one wanted to be part of a potential suicide . Two days before Taylor 's own attempt , a domestic cat was sent over the Horseshoe Falls in her barrel to test its strength . Contrary to rumors at the time , the cat survived the plunge unharmed and later was posed with Taylor in photographs . On October 24 , 1901 , her 63rd birthday , the barrel was put over the side of a rowboat , and Taylor climbed in , along with her lucky heart-shaped pillow . After screwing down the lid , friends used a bicycle tire pump to compress the air in the barrel . The hole used for this was plugged with a cork , and Taylor was set adrift near the American shore , south of Goat Island . The Niagara River currents carried the barrel toward the Canadian Horseshoe Falls , which has since been the site for all daredevil stunting at Niagara Falls . Rescuers reached her barrel shortly after the plunge . Taylor was discovered to be alive and relatively uninjured , except for a small gash on her head . The trip itself took less than twenty minutes , but it was some time before the barrel was actually opened . After the journey , Annie Taylor told the press : She briefly earned money speaking about her experience , but was never able to build much wealth . Her manager , Frank M. Russell , decamped with her barrel , and most of her savings were used towards private detectives hired to find it . It was eventually located in Chicago , only to permanently disappear some time later . She spent her final years posing for photographs with tourists at her souvenir stand , attempting to earn money from the New York Stock Exchange , briefly talking about taking a second plunge over the cataracts in 1906 , attempting to write a novel , re-constructing her 1901 plunge on film ( which was never seen ) , working as a clairvoyant , and providing magnetic therapeutic treatments to local residents . Annie Taylor died on April 29 , 1921 , aged 82 , at the Niagara County Infirmary in Lockport , New York . She is interred in the `` Stunters Section '' of Oakwood Cemetery in Niagara Falls , New York . Annie Taylor 's character appears in the IMAX film Niagara : Miracles , Myths and Magic . Emma Donoghue has written a short story featuring Taylor 's descent . She is also depicted in a National Geographic special `` Conquering Niagra '' where National Geographic documents all stunts attempted over the falls .
Milkweed butterflies are a subfamily , Danainae , in the family Nymphalidae , or brush-footed butterflies . They lay their eggs on various milkweeds on which their larvae ( caterpillars ) feed . Historically , this group had been considered a separate family , Danaidae , and the tribes placed herein were sometimes considered distinct subfamilies in the Nymphalidae . There are some 300 species of Danainae worldwide . Most of the Danaini are found in tropical Asia and Africa , while the Ithomiini are diverse in the Neotropics . Tellervini are restricted to Australia and the Oriental region . Four species are found in North America : the Monarch Butterfly ( Danaus plexippus ) ; the Queen ( Danaus gilippus ) ; the Tropical Milkweed Butterfly ( Lycorea cleobaea ) ; and the Soldier Butterfly ( or `` Tropic Queen '' ; Danaus eresimus ) . The best known member of this family is the Monarch butterfly . The larvae and the butterflies retain poisonous glycosides from their larval host plant , the milkweed , so they become distasteful to potential predators . These milkweed butterflies ( Monarch , Queen , Soldier ) eat only milkweeds ( Asclepias ) as larvae . This highly effective defense strategy shields them against almost all predators that soon learn to avoid these species after attempting to eat them . Another member known especially for its presence in butterfly greenhouses and live butterfly expositions is the Southeast Asian Idea leuconoe . Some authors classify this family as a subfamily of Nymphalidae . Many other authors accept the traditional classification of Danaidae as a separate family . This separation is based on similarity of early stages , similar habits and poisonous nature . Numerous wasps are parasitoids of milkweed butterfly caterpillars . The extensive modification of landscapes in the United States and Canada , with the removal of roadside weeds that are butterfly host plants and the large-scale use of pesticides , and increased deforestation in Mexico , threatens the migratory Monarch butterfly .
The olfactory system is the sensory system used for olfaction , or the sense of smell . Most mammals and reptiles have two distinct parts to their olfactory system : a main olfactory system and an accessory olfactory system . The main olfactory system detects volatile , airborne substances , while the accessory olfactory system senses fluid-phase stimuli . Behavioral evidence indicates that most often , the stimuli detected by the accessory olfactory system are awareness The olfactory system is often spoken of along with the gustatory system as the chemosensory senses because both transduce chemical signals into perception . The mechanism of the olfactory system can be divided into a peripheral one , sensing an external stimulus and encoding it as an electric signal in neurons , and a central one , where all signals are integrated and processed in the central nervous system . In mammals , the main olfactory system detects odorants that are inhaled through the nose , where they contact the main olfactory epithelium , which contains various olfactory receptors . These olfactory receptors are membrane proteins of bipolar olfactory receptor neurons in the olfactory epithelium . Rather than binding specific ligands like most receptors , olfactory receptors display affinity for a range of odor molecules . Olfactory neurons transduce receptor activation into electrical signals in neurons . The signals travel along the olfactory nerve , which belongs to the peripheral nervous system . This nerve terminates in the olfactory bulb , which belongs to the central nervous system . The complex set of olfactory receptors on different olfactory neurons can distinguish a new odor from the background environmental odors and determine the concentration of the odor . Axons from the olfactory sensory neurons converge in the olfactory bulb to form tangles called glomeruli ( singular glomerulus ) . Inside the glomulerus , the axons contact the dendrites of mitral cells and several other types of cells . Mitral cells send their axons to a number of brain areas , including the anterior olfactory nucleus , piriform cortex , the medial amygdala , and the entorhinal cortex . The piriform cortex is probably the area most closely associated with identifying the odor . The medial amygdala is involved in social functions such as mating and the recognition of animals of the same species . The entorhinal cortex is associated with memory , e.g. to pair odors with proper memories . The exact functions of these higher areas are a matter of scientific research and debate . In the central nervous system , odors are represented as patterns of neural activity . These representations may be encoded by space ( a pattern of activated neurons across a given olfactory region corresponds to the odor ) , time ( a pattern of action potentials by multiple neurons corresponds to the odor ) or a combination of the two . Scientists debate whether the odor code is primarily temporal or spatial . Damage to the olfactory system can occur by traumatic brain injury , cancer , infection , inhalation of toxic fumes , or neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson 's disease and Alzheimer 's disease . These conditions can cause anosmia . Doctors can detect damage to the olfactory system by presenting the patient with odors via a scratch and sniff card or by having the patient close their eyes and try to identify commonly available odors like coffee or peppermint candy . Linda B. Buck and Richard Axel won the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on the olfactory system .

Ningaloo Reef is a fringing coral reef located off the west coast of Australia , approximately 1200 km north of Perth . The reef is 260 km long and is Australia 's largest fringing coral reef and the only large reef positioned very close to a landmass . It is known for its seasonal feeding concentrations of the whale shark , and the conservation debate surrounding its potential tourism development . In 1987 the reef and surrounding waters were designated as the Ningaloo Marine Park . Although most famed for its whale sharks which feed there during March to June , the reef is also rich in coral and other marine life . During the winter months , the reef is part of the migratory routes for dolphins , dugongs , manta rays and humpback whales . The beaches of the reef are an important breeding ground of the loggerhead , green and hawksbill turtles . They also depend on the reef for nesting and food . The Ningaloo supports an abundance of fish ( 500 species ) , corals ( 300 species ) , molluscs ( 600 species ) and many other marine invertebrate . The reef is less than half a kilometre offshore in some areas , such as Coral Bay . In 2006 , researchers from the Australian Institute of Marine Science discovered in the marine parkâ s deeper waters gardens of sponges that are thought to be species completely new to science . The Australian Federal Minister for Environment Protection Peter Garrett announced on Wednesday 6 January 2010 that Ningaloo Reef would be nominated for World Heritage listing . The nomination will be assessed over the next 18 months by the World Heritage Centre in Paris , France . In the early 2000s there was much controversy about the proposed construction of a resort at an area called Mauds Landing , which was a major nesting ground of the loggerhead turtle . It was also feared that the resort would be generally degrading to the entire marine park . Local author Tim Winton was particularly opposed to the development , and spoke publicly against it . In 2002 , when he won the WA Premier 's Book Award , he donated the $ 25,000 prize money to the community campaign to save the reef . Ultimately the planned resort did not go ahead . However , developers continue to take an interest in the area . The Ningaloo Collaboration Cluster is a major research project that commenced in the region in 2007 . It is part of the CSIRO flagship Collaboration Fund Research Initiative . The project involves researchers from the CSIRO , Sustainable Tourism Cooperative Research Centre and a range of Australian Universities including Curtin University of Technology , Murdoch University , University of Western Australia , Australian National University and the University of Queensland . The project will deliver a dynamic model of Ningaloo incorporating socioeconomic and environmental load implications of human activity in the region that can be integrated with an ecological model of the region with the ultimate aim of developing planning tools and management models to ensure sustainable use of the region . The study will involve the collection and processing of socioeconomic data from tourists and the host communities of Exmouth , Coral Bay and Carnarvon . It will also involve the collection of data concerning the environmental load of human activity including natural resource use , waste generation , pollution , visual impacts and impacts on flora and fauna . The project will be interactive , and will involve key stakeholders in the region . These stakeholders will include the Department of Environment and Conservation ( DEC ) , Shires of Carnarvon & Exmouth , local tourism organizations and Tourism WA , Gascoyne Development Commission , Departments of Water and Environment , researchers from Wealth from the Oceans and Ningaloo Project , Chambers of Commerce , Department of Energy and Resources , Department of Fisheries , Department for Planning and Infrastructure , Ningaloo Sustainable Development Committee and Ningaloo Sustainable Development Office , Yamatji Land and Sea Council representatives , and the Ningaloo research community along with other cluster project members and the Stateâ s Ningaloo project . The project will also engage planners and managers in the region to examine tourism development and management .
Wesley Sonck ( born 9 August 1978 in Ninove ) is a Belgian football player , who currently plays as a striker for K. Lierse S.K. who signed him in August 2010 and the Belgium national football team . He played for KRC Genk in the Belgian First Division from where he joined AFC Ajax in 2003 for about Â # 5 million . He finished as the top scorer of Belgian First Division in 2002 with 30 goals and in 2003 with 22 goals , which he shared with CÃ dric Roussel . Sonck moved to Ajax in the summer of 2003 , to replace departed striker Mido . He made his debut on the 12 August against Grazer AK . He scored his first goal for the club 13 September against RKC Waalwijk . Sonck never really made it in Amsterdam , partly because he was playing on the right wing a lot under coach Ronald Koeman . He moved to Borussia MÃ nchengladbach in the winter of 2004 . His game with Borussia MÃ nchengladbach of the German Bundesliga was hampered by injuries . MÃ nchengladbach then signed him on a permanent contract , a deal initially arranged already at the start of his loan . In the summer of 2005 Sonck had three of his ribs broken after a horrific tackle by Wilfred Bouma in a goalless , meaningless friendly between Borussia MÃ nchengladbach & PSV Eindhoven . Sonck took six months to recover , marking his return to competitive football with a goal in a 3-1 defeat by Bayern Munich . He scored three more in 13 further Bundesliga games for MÃ nchengladbach until he was forced out for three months with an injury in the hollow of his knee at the start of the season of 2006-2007 . He left Gladbach at the end of the season , joining Club Brugge on a year long loan deal while Borussia MÃ nchengladbach began playing in the second tier of the Bundesliga . Sonck later joined Brugge permanently for an undisclosed fee . Sonck then left Club Brugge at the end of the 2009\/10 season , joining Lierse S.K. on a free transfer having fallen out with manager Adrie Koster over contract negotiations and lack of first team action . Amongst his first goals for the club was an excellent overhead kick . Sonck was called for the national team during the 2010 World Cup qualifiers . In the match versus Spain he scored Belgium 's only goal in that match , thus ending Casillas and Reina 's undefeated streak of 710 minutes . K.R.C. Genk

Ashland is home to one of the oldest churches in Virginia : Slash Church , built in 1729 by Anglican parishioners . The church is still in operation . Major Payne was filmed at the Ashland Train Station . Many citizens of Ashland unsuccessfully fought off a bid to build a Wal-Mart just outside of town ( using pink lawn flamingos as an anti-walmart symbol ) , and they were featured in the 2001 PBS special Store Wars - When Wal-Mart Comes to Town . In October 2002 , Ashland made national news as the site of one of the Beltway sniper attacks . 37-year-old Jeffrey Hopper was shot on October 19 at 8:00 pm in the parking lot of a Ponderosa Steakhouse as he was leaving the restaurant with his wife . The Ashland Volunteer Fire Company , formed in 1890 , is located on 501 Archie Canon Drive . It is one of the oldest all-volunteer fire stations in Virginia , handling about 2,000 calls per year . Ashland is home to the Strawberry Faire that takes place every June . This festival brings vendors from all around the state who sell a variety of different things ( with a strawberry theme ) . There is also a Strawberry Faire Pageant for Little Miss and Mister Strawberry . There is even a Strawberry Faire Scholarship awarded to ten Hanover County Schools students each year . The Faire also includes live performances from local artist . June 4th 2011 will mark the 30th Anniversary of the Strawberry Faire
A typical clearance for an Aurigny flight from Alderney to Southampton will read as follows : `` Ayline ( see footnote ) 123 : your clearance is to the Northern Zone boundary via ORTAC , on track Romeo 41 . '' The Parliament of Pakistan , officially known as Majlis-e-Shoora ( Urdu : Ù Ø Ù Ø Ø Ù Ø Û ) ( Council of Advisors in Urdu and Persian , although referred to as `` Parliament '' ) is the federal and supreme legislative body of Pakistan . It is bicameral federal legislature of Pakistan that consists of the Senate ( upper house ) and the National Assembly ( lower house ) . According to Article 50 of the Constitution of Pakistan , the Council also includes the President of Pakistan . The National Assembly of Pakistan is the lower house . It consist of 342 members , 272 of whom are directly elected , 60 reserved for women and 10 for minorities . 13 women are directly elected as Pakistani law requires that at least 20 % of the members be women . Presentation of budget is categorically the duty of national assembly . Members of cabinet must be the members of national assembly . The Senate of Pakistan is the upper house of parliament . It has 100 members ; As of 2008 , 18 of these members are women , one greater than the required number . According to the constitution , the President can not dissolve Senate . Members of the Senate are elected from provincial assemblies . The Constitution , which is written in English , uses the spelling Majlis-e-Shoora ( Parliament ) . Majlis-i-Shoora , Majlis-e-Shura , and Majlis-i-Shura are also valid transliterations from the Urdu spelling . The Parliament of Pakistan - viz the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan - met on August 10 , 1947 in the old Sindh Assembly Building at Karachi . It was in this venue that the Objectives Resolution , which now serves as the grund norm of Pakistan , was passed . In 1956 , the first Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan was adopted in Karachi at the same Sindh Assembly building which also passed as the Parliament of Pakistan . After the adoption of the Second Constitution of 1962 , Parliament sessions were arranged both at Dhaka and a newly constructed building ( Ayub Hall ) at Rawalpindi . The Parliament was uni-cameral . At the first session of the Parliament at the Ayub Hall , the Martial Law , imposed in 1958 , was revoked . Later , in October , 1966 , the Parliament was shifted to Dhaka . From 1972 onward , the State Bank auditorium in Islamabad functioned as the National Assembly of Pakistan . The Interim Constitution of Pakistan was adopted here in April , 1972 . It was here that the first bi-cameral legislature of Pakistan was also born after the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan was adopted in 1973 . It was again here that the Martial Law , imposed in July , 1977 , was revoked on December 30 , 1985 . The Parliament - the Senate and the National Assembly - have acquired a permanent abode in the present Parliament House , which was inaugurated on May 28 , 1986 .
JÃ nkÃ ping ( yan-SHO-ping ) is a city in southern Sweden with 84,420 inhabitants ( 2005 ) . It is the 9th most populous city of Sweden . JÃ nkÃ ping is situated by the southern end of Sweden 's second largest lake , VÃ ttern . The original town JÃ nkÃ ping has grown together with Huskvarna and Norrahammar forming a contiguous urban area , since 1971 wholly within the same municipality . The city is the seat of JÃ nkÃ ping Municipality which has a population of 122,194 ( 2006 ) , and also the seat of JÃ nkÃ ping County which has a population of 331,539 ( 2006 ) . JÃ nkÃ ping is the seat of a district court and a court of appeal as well as the Swedish National Courts Administration . It is also the seat of the Swedish Board of Agriculture . JÃ nkÃ ping is an old trading center ( KÃ ping ) , since it was located on a crossroad for the roads following along the rivers Nissan and Lagan , and the road between the provinces Ã -- stergÃ tland and VÃ stergÃ tland . This was rather natural due to the geographical position of the city at the southern end of lake VÃ ttern , which divided the two counties . On 18 May 1284 , JÃ nkÃ ping received rights as a City in Sweden as one of the first communities in the country , by King Magnus LadulÃ s , who at that time largely ruled the nation from VÃ ttern 's largest island VisingsÃ . In the name of the city `` JÃ n - '' is derived from a creek , `` JunebÃ cken '' , which was situated in the nowadays western part of the city , Talavid . This was the location of the first known settlement in the area . The second part of the name '' - kÃ ping '' , as mentioned above , is an old word for a trading center or market place . However , the geographical position of the city also left it vulnerable to foreign attacks , mainly from the Danes , coming from the south with the river roads ; at that time , the provinces of what is today southern Sweden -- Scania , Halland and Blekinge -- belonged to Denmark . Consequently , the city was plundered and burned several times , until a fortification was built in the 16th and 17th century . JÃ nkÃ ping is known for its matchstick industry 1845-1970 . Still today it is an important Swedish logistical center , with many companies ' central warehouses situated there ( like IKEA , Electrolux and Husqvarna ) . The urban area of JÃ nkÃ ping today includes the eastern industrial town of Huskvarna , with which it has grown together . A major fair and exhibition center , Elmia is also located in JÃ nkÃ ping , with fairs including Elmia Wood , the worldâ s largest forestry fair . Elmiaâ s fairs are also the biggest of their kind in Europe for subcontractors , trucks , caravans and railways . Since 2002 , Elmia has also been the site of the world 's largest LAN party , DreamHack . JÃ nkÃ ping 's climate is humid continental ( KÃ ppen Dfb ) with long , cold winters and short , warm summers .

The Red Forest ( Ukrainian : Ð Ñ Ð Ð Ð Ð '' Ñ -- Ñ , Russian : Ð Ñ Ð Ð Ð Ð '' Ð Ñ ) , formerly the Worm Wood Forest , refers to the trees in the 10 kmÂ surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant . The name ` Red Forest ' comes from the ginger-brown color of the pine trees after they died following the absorption of high levels of radiation from the Chernobyl accident on April 26 , 1986 . In the post-disaster cleanup operations , the Red Forest was bulldozed and buried in ` waste graveyards ' . The site of the Red Forest remains one of the most contaminated areas in the world today . The Red Forest is located in the zone of alienation ; this area received the highest doses of radiation from the Chernobyl accident and the resulting clouds of smoke and dust , heavily polluted with radiation . The trees died from this radiation . The explosion and fire at the Chernobyl No. 4 reactor contaminated the soil , water and atmosphere with the radiation equivalent to 20 times of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . In the post-disaster cleanup operations , a majority of the pine trees were bulldozed and buried in trenches by the `` liquidators '' . The trenches were then covered with a thick carpet of sand and planted with pine saplings . Many fear that as the trees decay , radiation will leach into the ground water . People have evacuated the contaminated zone around the Red Forest . As humans were evacuated from the area in 1986 , animals moved in despite the radiation . The flora and fauna of the Red Forest have been dramatically affected by the radioactive contamination that followed the accident . It seems that the biodiversity of the Red Forest has increased in the years following the disaster . There are reports of some stunted plants in the area . The site of the Red Forest remains one of the most contaminated areas in the world . However , it has proved to be an astonishingly fertile habitat for many endangered species . The evacuation of the area surrounding the nuclear reactor has created a lush and unique wildlife refuge . In the 1996 BBC Horizon documentary `` Inside Chernobyl 's Sarcophagus '' , birds are seen flying in and out of large holes in the structure of the former nuclear reactor . The long-term impact of the fallout on the flora and fauna of the region is not fully known , as plants and animals have significantly different and varying radiologic tolerance . Some birds are reported with stunted tail feathers ( which interferes with breeding ) . Storks , wolves , beavers , and eagles have been reported in the area . Today , radiation levels in the Red Forest can be as high as one rÃ ntgen per hour , but levels of ten millirÃ ntgens per hour are more common . More than 90 % of the radioactivity of the Red Forest is concentrated in the soil . Scientists are planning to use the nearby , radioactive and abandoned town of Pripyat and surrounding area as a unique laboratory for modeling the dispersal of radionuclides by the detonation of a dirty bomb or an attack with chemical or biological agents . The area offers an unparalleled opportunity to fully understand the passage of radioactive debris through an urban and rural area . The nature of the area seems to have not only survived , but flourished due to significant reduction of human impact . The zone has become a `` Radiological Reserve '' , a classic example of an involuntary park . There were thought to be cases of mutant deformity in animals of the Red Forest , but none have been proven , except partial albinism in swallows . Currently , there is concern about contamination of the soil with Strontium-90 and Caesium-137 , which have half-lives of about 30 years . The highest levels of Caesium-137 are found in the surface layers of the soil where they are absorbed by plants , and insects living there today . Some scientists fear that radioactivity will affect the land for the next several generations .
The British Rail Class 508 electric multiple units ( `` EMUs '' ) were built by BREL at York works in 1979-80 . They were the fourth variety of BR 's then-standard 1972 design for suburban EMUs , eventually encompassing 755 vehicles and five classes ( 313\/314\/315 \/ 507\/508 ) . They have mostly worked on the Merseyrail network since 1983 , and continue to do so , now refurbished by Alstom 's Eastleigh Works . The Class 508 EMUs were developed for Merseyside following extensive trials and testing of the 4Pep\/2Pep stock built in the early 1970s . Testing of Class 313 stock took place on Merseyside , using 313003 and 313005 . However , following planning and building , British Rail decided to divert the 508s to work alongside much older first-generation 4Sub EMUs in the London Waterloo area . Based at Strawberry Hill depot , they soon became very unpopular in the Southern region due to their being non-standard . Once a new build of Class 455 EMUs were complete the 508s were slowly sent to their originally intended home on the Merseyrail network , to work alongside the already well-established fleet of Class 507 EMUs working there since 1978 . All 43 508s are now formed of three cars , although they were four-car sets on the Southern Region . When sent to Merseyside one of the trailer cars was removed and incorporated into the 455\/7 build of EMUs . The individual passenger door controls , which had been a feature of these units , were plated over before the units were sent north . Original plans were drawn up for 58 508s to be constructed , although costing issues limited the eventual number to 43 . Carriage numbering is as follows : Merseyrail operates 27 508s , which are used interchangeably between the Northern Line and the Wirral Line . Connex South Eastern leased 12 508s which were freed up by controversially cutting back Merseyrail 's Wirral services in 1996 ( 508101\/105\/106 \/ 107\/109\/113 \/ 116\/119\/121 \/ 129\/132\/133 ) , for operation on specific Kent services . This fleet is used due to lack of Networkers ( 466s ) , particularly on the Medway Valley Line and the Isle of Sheppey line . In September 2006 new operator Southeastern announced that a cascade of rolling stock would see Class 466s units replace the 508s on the Sheerness and Medway Valley lines in the December 2006 timetable . Following this timetable change there are now only six units left in Southeastern operation based at Gillingham Depot . There are five units in ` warm store ' at Ashford Chart Leacon , and one unit , 508212 , is heavily robbed to keep the surviving service units in operation . It recently swapped its TSO coach with one from a service unit that ran into a tree on the Redhill-Tonbridge line . With the transfer of the Tonbridge to London via Redhill services to Southern , Southeastern placed its remaining fleet of Class 508s in store in December 2008 . Although , the 6 remaining in warm store , these units run 4 times every Wednesday : for the purposes of routine maintenance and the upkeep of mileages . Silverlink leased three 508s from Angel Trains in 2003 for operation on the London Euston-Watford Junction line to assist its fleet of Class 313 EMUs . Of these units , one has been released to date , the remaining units are still currently in use pending the arrival of Class 378 units . Network Rail 's Route Utilisation Strategy for the Merseyside region has called for an expansion to Merseyrail 's current fleet to allow for both additional services and lengthening of trains to six cars . In December 2009 it was reported by various sources that the former Southeastern and London Overground units would be transferred to Merseyrail . Two ex-Overground units were moved to Warrington Arpley yard in November 2009 , but returned south soon after . Meanwhile the ex-Southeastern 508s have moved to Telford Railfreight Terminal for storage . As of June 2010 no additional units have been taken on by Merseyrail . 508s have appeared in many colors over their lifetimes , more so than any EMU of similar type . In late 2004 , to mark Liverpool 's success in being named European Capital of Culture 2008 , Merseyrail named 508136 ` Capital of Culture ' . This name was affixed using vinyl transfers as opposed to cast metal nameplates . On 6 March 2007 a Class 508 ( set 508210 ) , forming the 0500 Tonbridge to Gatwick Airport service , derailed near Crowhurst , Surrey , after hitting a fallen tree on the line . None of the eight people on board were hurt . On 26 October 2005 a Class 508 ( set 508124 ) , forming the 2W43 17:06 West Kirby return via Liverpool Lime Street , derailed 200m short of Liverpool Central , caused by track gauge widening due to poor track condition . There were no serious injuries . The RAIB report cited incompatibility between Class 508 ( and 507 ) EMUs and the Liverpool Loop track as a causal factor , along with maintenance and other track design concerns .
The tail is the section at the rear end of an animal 's body ; in general , the term refers to a distinct , flexible appendage to the torso . It is the part of the body that corresponds roughly to the sacrum and coccyx in mammals and birds . While tails are primarily a feature of vertebrates , some invertebrates including scorpions and springtails , as well as snails and slugs , have tail-like appendages that are sometimes referred to as tails . Tailed objects are sometimes referred to as `` caudate '' and the part of the body associated with or proximal to the tail are given the adjective `` caudal '' . Animal tails are used in a variety of ways . They provide a source of locomotion for fish and some other forms of marine life . Many land animals use their tails to brush away flies and other biting insects . Some species , including cats and kangaroos , use their tails for balance ; and some , such as New World monkeys and opossums , have what are known as prehensile tails , which are adapted to allow them to grasp tree branches . Tails are also used for social signaling . Some deer species flash the white underside of their tails to warn other nearby deer of possible danger , and canids ( including domestic dogs ) indicate emotions through the positioning and movement of their tails . Some species ' tails are armored , and some , such as the those of scorpions , contain venom . Some species of lizard can detach ( `` cast '' ) their tails from their bodies . This can help them to escape from predators , which are either distracted by the wriggling detached tail , or left with only the tail while the rest of the lizard flees . Tails cast in this manner generally grow back over time , though the replacement is typically darker in color than the original . The tails of most birds end in long feathers called rectrices . These feathers are used as a rudder , helping the bird to steer and maneuver in flight ; they also help the bird to balance while it is perched . In some species -- such as birds of paradise , lyrebirds , and most notably peafowl -- modified tail feathers play an important role in courtship displays . The extra-stiff tail feathers of other species , including woodpeckers and woodcreepers , allow them to brace themselves firmly against tree trunks . The tails of grazing animals , such as horses , are used both to sweep away insects , and positioned or moved in ways that indicate the animal 's physical or emotional state . A scut is a short , erect tail . Hares , rabbits , and deer have scuts . Human embryos have a tail that measures about one-sixth of the size of the embryo itself . As the embryo develops into a fetus , the tail is absorbed by the growing body . The developmental tail is thus a human vestigial structure . Infrequently , a child is born with a `` soft tail '' , which contains no vertebrae , but only blood vessels , muscles , and nerves , although there have been several documented cases of tails containing cartilage or up to five vertebrae . Some of these tails may in fact be sacrococcygeal teratomas . A man named Chandre Oram , who lives in West Bengal , a state in India , is famous because of his 33 c tail . It is not believed to be a true tail , however , but rather a case of spina bifida . Humans have a `` tail bone '' ( the coccyx ) attached to the pelvis , in the same place which other mammals have tails . The tail bone is formed of fused vertebrae , usually four , at the bottom of the vertebral column . It does not protrude externally , but retains an anatomical purpose : providing an attachment for muscles like the gluteus maximus .
The Framlingham Branch was a six mile long single track branch railway line that ran from Wickham Market railway station on the East Suffolk Line to via three intermediate stations , , , and . Authorised in 1854 , along with a line from to , the line opened on 1 June 1859 . The branch became part of the London & North Eastern Railway in 1923 and British Railways from 1948 . Well used until the 1930s when passenger numbers fell due to the increased popularity of road transport the line closed to passenger services on 1 November 1952 , and to freight on 19 April 1963 .
Graham Anthony Kavanagh ( born 2 December 1973 ) is an Irish footballer he is known for his distinctive gray hair , with a long fringe and short elsewhere . He is esistent maager for Carlisle United , having also played for Home Farm , Middlesbrough , Stoke City , Cardiff City , Wigan Athletic , Sunderland and two loan spells at Sheffield Wednesday . Kavanagh began his career at Home Farm , before joining Middlesbrough in 1991 but struggled to ever hold down a first team place and was sold to Stoke City in 1996 , after a short loan spell at the club , for Â # 250,000 . He was eventually to move to Cardiff City in 2001 for Â # 1 million , and went on to score fifteen times in his first season at the club and help them to promotion the following year when they beat Queens Park Rangers in the Division two play-off final . He scored one of Cardiff 's goals as they memorably knocked out then Premiership Leeds United in the FA Cup third round in 2002 . During the 2004 â `` 05 season Cardiff chairman Sam Hammam revealed that the club was in serious financial trouble and as such a number of players left the club to attempt to regain losses , including Kavanagh who signed for Wigan Athletic for a fee close to Â # 400,000 . Whilst at Wigan he started in the 2006 Football League Cup Final . On 31 August 2006 , he signed a three-year deal with Roy Keane 's Sunderland for Â # 500,000 . During that season he played 14 games , scoring one goal against Leeds , before he was ruled out for the majority of games due to lingering injury problems . He joined Sheffield Wednesday on 21 September 2007 on a loan deal to regain his fitness where he played seven games , scoring one goal against Watford on 2 October . On 29 December , Leicester City made a bid for Kavanagh , together with MÃ rton FÃ 1\/4 lÃ p. However , on 31 January 2008 Kavanagh again joined Wednesday on a loan deal until the end of the season . Kavanagh joined League One side Carlisle United on a month 's loan on 10 October 2008 . This loan was extended for a further month on 7 November . It was again extended on 18 December and would expire on 3 January 2009 . On 9 January , Kavanagh was released by Sunderland and returned to Carlisle on a permanent basis as a player-coach .

Kavanagh is married to the sister of Liam O'Brien .
The Bank of China Tower ( abbreviated BOC Tower ) is one of the most recognisable skyscrapers in Central , Hong Kong . It houses the headquarters for the Bank of China ( Hong Kong ) Limited . The building is located at 1 Garden Road , in Central and Western District on Hong Kong Island . Designed by I. M. Pei , the building is 307 m high with two masts reaching 360.9 m high . It was the tallest building in Hong Kong and Asia from 1989 to 1992 , and it was the first building outside the United States to break the 305 m ( 1,000 ft ) mark . It is now the fourth tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong , after International Commerce Centre , Two International Finance Centre and Central Plaza . The 6,700 mÂ site on which the building is constructed was formerly the location of Murray House . After its brick-by-brick relocation to Stanley , the site was sold by the Government for `` only HK$ 1 billion '' in August 1982 amidst growing concern over the future of Hong Kong in the run-up to the transfer of sovereignty . Once developed , gross floor area was expected to be 100,000 mÂ . The original project was intended for completion on the auspicious date of 8 August 1988 . However , owing to project delays , groundbreaking took place in March 1985 , almost two years late . It was topped out in 1989 , and occupied on 15 June 1990 . The building was initially built by the Hong Kong Branch of the Bank of China ; its Garden Road entrance continues to display the name `` Bank of China '' , rather than BOCHK . The top four and the bottom 19 stories are used by the Bank , while the other floors are leased out . Ownership has since been transferred to BOCHK , although the Bank of China has leased back several floors for use by its own operations in Hong Kong . The Government had apparently given preferential treatment to Chinese companies , and was again criticised for the apparent preferential treatment to the BOCHK . The price paid was half the amount of the 6,250 mÂ Admiralty II plot , for which the MTR Corporation paid HK$ 1.82 billion in cash . The BOC would make initial payment of $ 60 million , with the rest payable over 13 years at 6 % interest . The announcement of the sale was also poorly handled , and a dive in business confidence ensued . The Hang Seng Index fell 80 points , and the HK$ lost 1.5 % of its value the next day . Designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect I. M. Pei , the building is 305.0 metres ( 1,000.7 ft ) high with two masts reaching 357.4 metres ( 1,205.4 ft ) high . The 72 story building is located near Central MTR station . This was the tallest building in Hong Kong and Asia from 1989 to 1992 , the first building outside the United States to break the 305 m ( 1,000 ft ) mark , and the first composite space frame high-rise building . That also means it was the tallest outside the United States from its completion year , 1990 . It is now the fourth tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong , after International Commerce Centre , Two International Finance Centre and Central Plaza . A small observation deck on the 43rd floor of the building is open to the public . The structural expressionism adopted in the design of this building resembles growing bamboo shoots , symbolising livelihood and prosperity . The whole structure is supported by the five steel columns at the corners of the building , with the triangular frameworks transferring the weight of the structure onto these five columns . It is covered with glass curtain walls . While its distinctive look makes it one of Hong Kong 's most identifiable landmarks today , it was the source of some controversy at one time , as the bank is the only major building in Hong Kong to have bypassed the convention of consulting with feng shui masters on matters of design prior to construction . The building has been criticised by some practitioners of feng shui for its sharp edges and its negative symbolism by the numerous ` X ' shapes in its original design , though Pei modified the design to some degree before construction following this feedback . The building 's profile from some angles resembles that of a meat cleaver . In Feng Shui , this is described as a cleaver building and it is not difficult to observe that it is facing the HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building in this guise . The BOC Tower 's bold futuristic design has made it into popular culture . It is the only Hong Kong landmark included in the city-building\/simulation computer games SimCity 3000 and SimCity 4 . The digitally modified facade of the building is featured in the science fiction television series Star Trek : Voyager as the Starfleet `` Communications Research Center '' . The building features alongside the Emirates Towers in the racing game ` Burnout Paradise ' In the film Category 7 : The End of the World , the tower is destroyed by a tornado .
The place of birth is the place where a person was born . This place is often used in legal documents , together with name and date of birth , to uniquely identify a person . The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live . If the baby is born in a hospital in another place , that place is the place of birth . In many countries , this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth . In other countries , e.g. in Sweden since 1947 , there is a concept of fÃ delsehemort ( `` domicile of birth '' ) , which means that the domicile of the baby 's mother is the registered place of birth . The location of the maternity ward or other `` physical '' birthplace is considered unimportant . Sometimes the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby , a practice often referred to with the Latin phrase jus soli ( it depends on the Law of the country to give the nationality ) . More often , this ( also ) depends on the nationality or nationalities of the parents ( what is referred to as `` jus sanguinis '' ) . There can be some confusion on the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way : when babies are born in an airplane or at sea , difficulties can arise . Generally , in those cases , the nationality of the children , under the statements of `` Jus soli '' , follows the flag of the plane or ship .

Uncle John 's Bathroom Readers are a series of books containing trivia and short essays on miscellaneous topics , ostensibly for reading in the bathroom . The books are credited to the Bathroom Readers ' Institute , though Uncle John is a real person , and are published by Portable Press , an imprint of Baker & Taylor . The introductions in the books , as well as brief notes in some articles , provide small pieces of information about Uncle John . The first book was published in 1988 , and in 2010 , the series reached its 23rd release , The Heavy Duty Bathroom Reader . Volumes dedicated to a single topic have been released , under the title Uncle John Plunges Into ... , for example : history , presidents , and the universe . There are also books on individual U.S. states , the weather , numbers , quotes , the year 2000 , a special book for mothers , cat lovers , love , Uncle John 's Book of the Dumb , and several Bathroom Readers for Kids Only ! . Though most of the books were written by the Bathroom Readers ' Institute , some of the ones that are based around a specific subject are written by a lone author , who is not in the Institute . Additionally , the Institute will often publish articles and other contributions sent in from readers . Recurring articles such as `` Flubbed Headlines '' , `` Oops '' , and `` Classifieds '' often depend on these contributions . Their volumes contain information on subjects such as quotes , dumb criminals , palindromes , anagrams , urban legends and hoaxes , failed inventions , the history of everyday things , and accidental discoveries , as well as articles on pop culture and ` celebrities ' such as Emperor Norton ( see Features ) . Throughout the books , there are what the BRI calls `` running feet '' - short fun facts on the bottom of each page . A typical example is `` An object on Jupiter would weigh 144,000 times more than it would on Pluto . '' Some books have one running foot that simply says `` Hi , mom . '' The series has sold 4.5 million copies . The Bathroom Readers ' Institute began in 1988 , with the publishing of the original Uncle John 's Bathroom Reader , by St. Martin 's Press Publishers . After the book 's success , Uncle John 's 2nd Bathroom Reader was published in 1989 , with a third and a fourth book being added to the series in the subsequent years . These earlier books are distinct from the rest not only due to their short length , but because of the writing style : Short articles starting with a brief history of the subject , followed by several tidbits on the subject . After the initial four , successful books , the BRI decided that it would publish its own books , and Uncle John 's 5th Bathroom Reader was released in October 1992 . It sold well . Preoccupied with the writing of book 6 , no more print runs were made . The same thing happened with 1993 's 6th Bathroom Reader , and 1994 's 7th Bathroom Reader . ( The books later became available in omnibus format when Uncle John 's Legendary Lost Bathroom Reader was printed . ) In 1995 , the millionth copy of the series was sold , and in commemoration , The Best of Uncle John 's Bathroom Reader , the 8th in the series , was printed . Books 5-8 are noted because they are the first to contain in-depth articles . In 1996 , the BRI got what was later described in the `` Legendary Lost Bathroom Reader '' as `` A New Attitude : '' The 9th book in the series was much larger . The group had begun to change their writing style and so books 9-14 , published from 1996-2002 , contain long articles that are spread out throughout the book , and use a more encyclopedic writing style . In 2003 a spin-off series was introduced , and the books were selling better than ever . For the first 15 years , `` Bathroom Readers '' referred to just one series . Now , there were several competitors , ( none quite as successful ) and quite a few series within the BRI . Books 15-18 began to move away from the format seen in previous books , using 2 and 3 part articles , and often not using features that had been popular from the beginning . Though the BRI have created many spin-offs , the classic editions are considered by many as the best . Here is a list of them .

In 2010 the former goalkeeper managed the RCD Carabanchel in Spain . Mauricio Roberto Pochettino Trossero ( born 2 March 1972 in Murphy , Santa Fe ) is a retired Argentine football central defender , and the current coach of RCD Espanyol . Pochettino started his professional career with Newell 's Old Boys , moving to RCD Espanyol in Spain in 1994 -- 95 , as the Catalans had just returned to the topflight . He was an undisputed starter in his six 1\/2 season spell , helping the club to the 2000 Spanish Cup . In January 2001 , Pochettino moved to Paris Saint-Germain FC : he was also a regular starter during his stay , and moved for 2003 -- 04 to fellow league outfit FC Girondins de Bordeaux . However , he returned to Espanyol ( initially on loan ) midway through his first year for two 1\/2 more seasons , still being regularly used except for his last one , and wrapping up his career , aged 34 , with another King 's Cup . In his two spells combined , he appeared in nearly 300 official matches for the club . In late January 2009 , Pochettino became Espanyol 's third coach in 2008 -- 09 , with the side then ranking third from bottom , but eventually finishing the season comfortably placed ( 10th ) , after the coach inclusively asked for `` divine intervention '' . He coached nine club players who were his teammates during his last season and , in early June , renewed his link for a further three years . In the 2009 -- 10 season , Pochettino once again led Espanyol to a comfortable league position , in a campaign where club symbol ( and his former teammate ) RaÃ l Tamudo fell completely out of favor in the squad 's rotation , even more after the January 2010 arrival of manager compatriot Pablo Osvaldo . On 28 September 2010 , he extended his contract with the club for one more year , until 30 June 2012 . Pochettino played for Argentina 20 times during four years , and was a participant at the 2002 FIFA World Cup , playing three complete matches as the nation exited in the group stage . In the second match against England , he brought down Michael Owen in the box .

A kill screen is a stage or level in a video game ( often an arcade game ) that stops the player 's progress due to a programming error or design oversight . Rather than `` ending '' in a traditional sense , the game will crash , freeze , or behave so erratically that further play is impossible . Video games , like any other computer software , can suffer from bugs . A bug in a video game is not automatically a kill screen ; to be one , the bug must occur consistently in the same point in the game and must preclude any further play . While almost any type of bug could cause this sort of behavior , the most common cause is simple oversights on the part of the game 's programmers such as an integer overflow of the level counter . Kill screens were much more common during the Golden Age of Arcade Games . Games from this era were often written with the assumption that the player would stop playing long before the numerical limits of the game code were reached ; most games from this period were intended to continue until the players lost all of their lives . Additionally , the limited hardware of these early machines often meant that programmers could not spend memory on logical checks of the game state . In the coin-operated version of Dig Dug , the game ends on round 256 ( round 0 ) since this board is essentially an unplayable kill screen . At the start of the level , an enemy is placed directly on top of where the player starts with no way to kill it . Pac-Man has a famous kill screen often referred to as the Pac-Man Bomb Screen . The game 's level counter was a single 8-bit byte and could therefore store only 256 distinct values ( 0 -- 255 ) . Reaching the 256th level causes the counter that is used while drawing the fruit to overflow to zero , causing 256 fruits and seven blank spaces to be drawn . It can , however , be fixed with a patch . Donkey Kong also featured a kill screen in the 22nd stage , and the 117th screen ( 85th in the Japanese version ) . This is an example of a kill screen that is not due to an integer overflow in a level counter ( since programmers prevented this ) , but a different oversight on the part of the designers . The amount of time allowed for any given screen is determined algorithmically during play by the level the player is on . The timer is calculated 100 Ã -- ( 10 Ã -- ( level + 4 ) ) , and has a maximum value of 8000 . When the level reaches 22 , the game reads 100 Ã -- ( 10 Ã -- ( 22 +4 ) : ) or 100 Ã -- 260 . However , the 8-bit counter rolls over at 256 , meaning the game calculates 100 Ã -- 4 . This causes the timer to be set so low that there is barely seven seconds for the player to complete the level , simply not enough time for the screen to possibly be completed . Steve Wiebe , a competitor from Redmond , Washington , attained this screen when he attempted to beat Billy Mitchell 's Donkey Kong high score ( which was the world record ) on G4TV at E3 2009 . It was the first kill screen to be broadcast on live television . Mr. Wiebe also reached a kill screen in the film The King of Kong : A Fistful of Quarters about his attempts for the world record of Donkey Kong . In the Nintendo Entertainment System game Duck Hunt , there is a kill screen that occurs in the 100th level . The level counter for Duck Hunt is stored in two numbers , that range from 01 to 99 , but when level 99 is completed , the value rolls over to 0 , creating a glitch . The 1st , 4th , and 6th through 10th ducks do not appear , and the other 3 appear in random places on the screen so quickly that it is nearly impossible to hit them . Even if they were hit , the level could not be completed with only 3 out of 10 ducks hit . The kill screen level has been completed in a tool-assisted speedrun . Level 29 of Tetris is referred to as a kill screen , but does not fit the above definition . Although the difficulty level is radically increased , a change in the numbering system for each subsequent level is viewed as a bug . After level 29 the level names are represented by hexadecimal numbers . The level immediately following level 29 is numbered as `` 00 '' ( corresponding to hex value 0x00 and decimal value 0 ) . Each subsequent level increments the displayed level value by the hex value 0x0A ( 10 in decimal ) . Therefore , the sequence of levels following level 29 is mathematically predictable : 0x00 , 0x0A , 0x14 , 0x1E , 0x28 , 0x32 , 0x3C , 0x46 , 0x50 , 0x5A , etc. . This numbering system , combined with the 8-bit storage limitation ( two hexidecimal characters ) , provides room for an additional 25 levels , ending with level 0xFA .
Mainbernheim is a municipality 4 kilometers to the south of Kitzingen ( Landkreis , district of Kitzingen ) in the direction of NÃ 1\/4 rnberg , was first recorded in the chronicles of 889 , during the reign of King Arnulf , the church being recognized by the influential bishopric of nearby WÃ 1\/4 rzburg . The town was the site of a tariff house of the dukes of Ansbach and in thrall until 1397 to the duchy in the south , during the reign of King Wenceslaus . Mainbernheim was granted full rights as a city , although taxation privileges for Ansbach were extended until 1795 . Today , Mainbernheim has a population of approximately 2400 , the town having grown significantly due to new developments outside the city walls . The gummi-bear factory , BÃ ren Schmidt , is the major industry there . Some extant points of interest include the 400-year-old farmhouses along HerrnstraÃ e , which transverses the city from gate to gate and hosts several historic hotels and restaurants . Also along the main street are the Rathaus ( city hall , 1548 ) and the adjacent Lutheran parish church , built on the foundations of an earlier cathedral ( 1498 ) after the Protestant Reformation ( 1750 â `` 1778 ) . Just outside the main gate is the cemetery and arcade , dating from 1546 and containing fine examples of funerary flourishes . Off the main street , there is a recessed portal , which served as a hiding place for the Jews during the purges of World War II . The appearance of the inner city is little changed since Renaissance times . This article incorporates documents from the WÃ 1\/4 rzburg and Mainbernheim Stadt Archives and the guide Kunst - und KulturfÃ 1\/4 hrer durch den Landkreis Kitzingen Â 1983 Dr. Hans Bauer , Kitzingen .

Arsenic pentoxide , As2O5 , is an important commercial compound of arsenic . Its usage with respect to arsenic chemistry , as well as its toxicology are similar to arsenic trioxide , As2O3 . Arsenic pentoxide is used as a solid or as a solution in the manufacturing of arsenates , weed killer , metal adhesives , insecticides , fungicides , wood preservatives , and colored gases and in printing and dyeing . Arsenic pentoxide can be synthesized by oxidizing arsenic trioxide with oxidizing agents such as ozone , hydrogen peroxide and nitric acid . Arsenic pentoxide decomposes to oxygen and As2O3 upon heating . It is an oxidizing agent , liable to react vigorously with oxidizable substances â '' for example , it liberates chlorine from hydrochloric acid . As2O5 dissolves readily in water to form arsenic acid , H3AsO4 .
The Sena Empire ( , Shen ) was a Hindu dynasty that ruled from Bengal through the 11th and 12th centuries . At its peak the empire covered much of the north-eastern region in the Indian Subcontinent . They were called Brahma-Kshatriyas , as evidenced through their surname , which is derived from the Sanskrit , for `` army '' . The Senas belonged to the ` Gaur Kayastha ' sub-caste of the Chitraguptvanshi Kayastha and they were Brahma-Kshatriyas ( those who were Brahmanas first and became Kshatriyas afterwards ) . The dynasty 's founder was Hemanta Sen , who was part of the Pala dynasty until their empire began to weaken . He usurped power and styled himself king in 1095 AD . His successor Vijay Sen ( ruled from 1096 AD to 1159 AD ) helped lay the foundations of the dynasty , and had an unusually long reign of over 60 years . Ballal Sena conquered Gaur from the Pala , became the ruler of Bengal and Delhi as well as made Nabadwip the capital . Lakshman Sen succeeded Ballal Sena in 1179 and ruled Bengal for approximately 20 years . He expanded the Sena Empire to Assam , Orissa , Bihar and probably to Varanasi . In 1203 â `` 1204 AD , the Turkic general Bakhtiyar Khilji attacked Nabadwip . Though he defeated Lakshman Sen , he failed to conquer Bengal . The Sena rulers were Hindus . During this period Buddhism that had dominated Bengal for centuries was in decline due to the loss of its institutions at Nalanda University and Vikramshila University . The dynasty is famous for building Hindu temples and monasteries including the famous Dhakeshwari Temple in what is now Dhaka , Bangladesh . The Sena dynasty were also great patrons of literature . During the rule of Pala dynasty and Sena dynasty , major growth of Bengali was witnessed . It is believed by some Bengali authors that Jayadeva , the famous Sanskrit poet and author of Gita Govinda , was one of the Pancharatnas ( meaning 5 gems ) in the court of Lakshman Sen. After the Sena dynasty , the Deva dynasty ruled in eastern part of Bengal . The Deva dynasty was probably the last independent Hindu dynasty of Bengal . A copperplate was found in the Adilpur or Edilpur pargana of Faridpur District in 1838 A.D. and to have been acquired by the Asiatic Society of Bengal , but now it is missing from collection . An account of the plate was published in the Dacca Review and Epigraphic Indica . The copperplate inscription written Sanskrit and in Ganda character dated 3rd jyaistha of 1136 samval which represents 1079 A.D. . The Asiatic Societyâ s proceeding for January 1838 , an account of the copperplate describes that 3 villages were given to a Brahman in the 3rd year of Kaesava Sana . These three villages can not be identified now , and thought it is impossible enough that they have been long ago washed away by Meghna , which flows past Edilpur paragana . The grant was given with the landlord rights , receives the power of punishing the chandrabhandas or Sundarbans , a race that lived in the forest . It records the grant of the land in the village of Leliya in the Kumaratalaka mandala situated in shatata-padamavati-visaya . The copperplate of Kaesava Sana tells that the king Vallal Sena carried away the goddesses of fortune for the enemies on palanquins ( Shivaka ) supported by staff made of elephant tusk . It also claims that his father Lakhman Sena ( 1179 â `` 1205 ) erects pillars of victory and sacrificial posts at Benaras and Allahbad and Adon Coast of South Sea . The plate also describes the villages with smooth fields growing excellent paddy also noticed about the dancing and music in the ancient Bengal and ladies of that period used to adorn their bodies with blooming flowers . The Edilpur copperplate of Kaesava Sena records that the king made a grant in favor of Nitipathaka Isvaradeva Sarman for the inscae of the subha-varsha .
Pawnee County is a county located in the U.S. state of Oklahoma . As of 2000 , the population was 16,612 . Its county seat is Pawnee . The Osage Tribe used the area that contains present day Pawnee County as buffalo hunting grounds . In 1825 , The Osage ceded parts of present-day Missouri , Arkansas and most of the future state of Oklahoma to the federal government . After their forced removal from the Southeastern United States , the Cherokee received land in Eastern Oklahoma as well as the Cherokee Outlet in 1828 , which included present-day Pawnee County . After the Civil War , the Cherokee agreed to allow other American Indians to settle in the eastern portion of the Outlet . In 1873 , the federal government began to relocate the Pawnee Tribe from Nebraska to a reservation here . In 1891 , The Pawnee agreed to take land allotments from the reservation , and the remaining land was opened to non-Indian settlers in 1893 during the Cherokee Outlet opening .

The Uckermark , a historical region in northeastern Germany , straddles the Uckermark District of Brandenburg and the Uecker-Randow District of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern . Its traditional capital is Prenzlau . The region is named after the Uecker River , which is a tributary of the Oder ; the name Uckermark means `` March of the Uecker '' . The river 's source is close to AngermÃ 1\/4 nde , from where it runs northward to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern . The Oder River , forming the German-Polish border , bounds the region in the east . The western parts of the Lower Oder Valley National Park are located in the Uckermark . The region was formed by glaciers of the Ice Age . After a climate change , a hilly area was left with several lakes formed by the melting ice . Humans started to settle the area . Megalith-cultures arose , followed by Germanic cultures From the 6th -- 12th centuries Polabian Slavs migrating from Eastern Europe moved westward into the later Uckermark . The Slavs settling the terra U ( c ) kera ( Uckerland , later Uckermark ) became known as Ukrani ( Ukranen , Ukrer , Ukri , Vukraner ) . Their settlement area was centered around the lakes Oberuckersee and Unteruckersee at the spring of the Uecker River . In this region , burghs with a proto-town suburbium were set up at Drense and on an isle in Lake Oberuckersee ( near modern Prenzlau ) . In 954 , Margrave Gero of the Saxon Eastern March ( the marca Geronis ) , aided by Holy Roman Emperor Otto I 's son-in-law , Conrad of Lorraine , launched a successful campaign to subdue the Ukrani , who had come in reach of the Empire after the 929 Battle of Lenzen . After the 983 revolt of the Obodrites and Liutizians , the area became independent again , yet remained under permanent military pressure , especially from Poland and the Holy Roman Empire . In 1172 Pomeranian dukes , vassals of the Duchy of Saxony , later of the Holy Roman Empire , controlled the area . In the course of the medieval Ostsiedlung , the Ukranen were Christianized and Germanized by Saxons , who founded monasteries , castles , and towns ; the Slavic heritage is reflected in the many regional towns whose names end with '' - ow '' and '' - in '' . The early centers of the territory were the Seehausen ( Gramzow ) Premonstratensian monastery and the city of Prenzlau , developed and granted German town law by Barnim I , Duke of Pomerania , in 1234 . Both the central city and the central monastery were set up beside the former Ukrani central burghs . The Margraviate of Brandenburg , holding claims on the Duchy of Pomerania , expanded north since the 1230s , taking her chances while the House of Pomerania was weakened . In the 1250 Treaty of Landin , Barnim I conceded the Uckermark to John I and Otto III , Ascanian Margraves of Brandenburg . After the extinction of the Ascanians , the Pomeranian dukes reacquired a few border regions . Mecklenburg advanced into the Uckermark , but lost her gains in a 1323 war with Brandenburg . In the Pomeranian-Brandenburg War from 1329 -- 33 , Pomerania was able to defeat Brandenburg at Kremmer Damm . In the following years , control of the Uckermark was disputed by Brandenburg , Mecklenburg , and Pomerania . The first Peace of Prenzlau of 3 May 1448 established Brandenburg 's control over most of the territory , except for the northern Pasewalk and Torgelow region , which was to remain in Pomerania and is not considered to be a part of Uckermark anymore . Though another Brandenburgian-Pomeranian war was fought in the area in the 1460s , Brandenburg 's possession of most of the Uckermark was confirmed again in a second Peace of Prenzlau on 30 July 1472 , which was renewed on 26 June 1479 . The Uckermark became part of Brandenburg-Prussia in 1618 , but was ravaged during the Thirty Years ' War . Frederick William , the Great Elector , invited large numbers of French Huguenots to resettle the Uckermark and his other territories by announcing the Edict of Potsdam . These Huguenots helped to develop the economy and culture of the Uckermark . In 1701 the territory became part of the Kingdom of Prussia . In 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars , the Uckermark became part of the Prussian Province of Brandenburg . Previously divided into the administrative units Uckerkreis and Stolpirischer Kreis , in 1817 a third district was created in the area , the district AngermÃ 1\/4 nde , and the other two districts were renamed to Prenzlau and Templin . The Uckermark was a battleground during World War II , with many of its towns being severely damaged . As part of East Germany after the war , the Uckermark was divided between Bezirk Neubrandenburg and Bezirk Frankfurt ( Oder ) . With German reunification in 1990 , most of the Uckermark voted to become part of the restored state of Brandenburg , with the exception of the small Strasburg region becoming part of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .
Panoplosaurus ( meaning `` completely armored lizard '' ) is a genus of nodosaurid dinosaur . It was one of the last known nodosaurids , living during the Late Cretaceous in what is now North America ; fossils have been located in Alberta , Canada . The first fossil was found in 1917 by Charles Mortram Sternberg in Quarry 8 , near Little Sandhill Creek . The type species Panoplosaurus mirus was in 1919 named by Lawrence Morris Lambe . The generic name is derived from Greek pan , `` completely '' and hoplon , `` armor '' . The specific name means `` wondrous '' in Latin . This holotype , CMN 2759 , was discovered in the Dinosaur Park Formation dating from the late middle Campanian , 76 million years ago . It consists of the complete skull with lower jaws , the cervical vertebrae , some dorsal vertebrae and some ribs . Part of the bony armor scutes or osteoderms were conserved . Later two more large specimens were found , again containing skulls but also providing some information about the shoulder girdle and front limbs : ROM 1215 and RTMP 83.25.2 . Panoplosaurus was 5.5 t long , around 2 m tall , and would have weighed approximately 3.5 t. It was heavily armored , even by the standards of other nodosaurs , probably with traverse bands of studded plates covering its back and tail , although the tail likely lacked the club found in ankylosaurids . Larger paired ovals of bony armor covered the neck , shoulders and front limbs . These ovals were keeled , possessing a prominent curved ridge on the outer surface . Spikes on the shoulder , that some other nodosaurids featured , were absent . The armor on the head was fused into a compact helmet-like shield ; these plates had a lumpy surface . Also bony cheek scutes were present . The skull was short and wide at the back . The head of the holotype specimen is particularly rounded ; the other two skulls are longer and flatter , perhaps reflecting age or gender differences . The animal had a relatively narrow snout , perhaps to aid in rooting about for low growing plants to eat and indicating a selective diet of highly nutritious food . Although the coracoid was slender and not fused to the scapula , the forelegs were particularly heavy , and had attachments for large muscles , which may suggest that the animal would have been surprisingly maneuverable in life , possibly being able to make defensive charges like a modern rhinoceros . The hand perhaps had only three fingers . The pelvis was attached to four sacral vertebrae with short sacral ribs . Originally assigned to the Ankylosauridae , Panoplosaurus is today considered a member of the Nodosauridae as a close relative of Edmontonia from the same formation . In 1971 Walter Coombs even referred the species of Edmontonia to a subgenus within Panoplosaurus , creating a Panoplosaurus ( Edmontonia ) longiceps and a Panoplosaurus ( Edmontonia ) rugosidens but this has found no lasting acceptance .
A memory card or flash card is an electronic flash memory data storage device used for storing digital information . They are commonly used in many electronic devices , including digital cameras , mobile phones , laptop computers , MP3 players , and video game consoles . They are small , re-recordable , and they can retain data without power . PC Cards ( PCMCIA ) were among first commercial memory card formats ( type I cards ) to come out in the 1990s , but are now mainly used in industrial applications and to connect I\/O devices such as modems . In 1990s , a number of memory card formats smaller than PC Card arrived , including CompactFlash , SmartMedia , and Miniature Card . The desire for smaller cards for cell-phones , PDAs , and compact digital cameras drove a trend that left the previous generation of `` compact '' cards looking big . In digital cameras SmartMedia and CompactFlash had been very successful , in 2001 SM alone captured 50 % of the digital camera market and CF had a stranglehold on professional digital cameras . By 2005 however , SD\/MMC had nearly taken over SmartMedia 's spot , though not to the same level and with stiff competition coming from Memory Stick variants , as well as CompactFlash . In industrial fields , even the venerable PC card ( PCMCIA ) memory cards still manage to maintain a niche , while in mobile phones and PDAs , the memory card market was highly fragmented until 2010 when micro-SD came to dominate new high-end phones and tablet computers . Since 2010 the new products of Sony ( previously only using Memory Stick ) and Olympus ( previously only using xD-Card ) are offered with an additional SD-Card slot . Effectively the format war has turned in SD-Card 's favor . Many game consoles have used proprietary solid-state memory cards to store data . In recent years read-only optical discs have replaced these memory cards in most current home console systems . However most portable gaming systems still rely on custom memory cartridges , due to their low power consumption , smaller physical size and reduced mechanical complexity . The sizes in parentheses are those of the official , first-party memory cards .

The following is a list of Atlantic hurricane seasons . The Atlantic hurricane season is the period in a year when hurricanes usually form in the Atlantic Ocean . Tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic are called hurricanes , tropical storms , or tropical depressions . Worldwide , tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer , when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest . However , each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns . On a worldwide scale , May is the least active month , while September is the most active . In the Northern Atlantic Ocean , a distinct hurricane season occurs from June 1 to November 30 , sharply peaking from late August through September ; the season 's climatological peak of activity occurs around September 10 each season . Tropical disturbances that reach tropical storm intensity are named from a pre-determined list . On average , 10.1 named storms occur each season , with an average of 5.9 becoming hurricanes and 2.5 becoming major hurricanes ( Category 3 or greater ) . The most active season was 2005 , during which 28 tropical cyclones formed , of which a record 15 became hurricanes . The least active season was the 1914 , with only one known tropical cyclone developing during that year . The North Atlantic hurricane database , or HURDAT , is the database for all tropical storms and hurricanes for the Atlantic Ocean , Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea , including those that have made landfall in the United States . The original database of six-hourly positions and intensities were put together in the 1960s in support of the Apollo space program to help provide statistical track forecast guidance . In the intervening years , this database - which is now freely and easily accessible on the Internet from the National Hurricane Center 's ( NHC 's ) Webpage - has been utilized for a wide variety of uses : climatic change studies , seasonal forecasting , risk assessment for county emergency managers , analysis of potential losses for insurance and business interests , intensity forecasting techniques and verification of official and various model predictions of track and intensity . HURDAT was not designed with all of these uses in mind when it was first put together and not all of them may be appropriate given its original motivation . HURDAT contains numerous systematic as well as some random errors in the database . Additionally , analysis techniques have changed over the years at NHC as their understanding of tropical cyclones has developed , leading to biases in the historical database . Another difficulty in applying the hurricane database to studies concerned with landfalling events is the lack exact location , time and intensity at hurricane landfall . HURDAT has been updated significantly only twice before . The first time was in 2001 when data for years 1851 to 1885 were added to the database . The second time was August 2002 when Hurricane Andrew was upgraded to a Category 5 . Recent efforts into uncovering undocumented historical hurricanes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries led by Jose Fernandez-Partagas have greatly increased our knowledge of these past events , which are not yet incorporated into the HURDAT database . Because of all of these issues , a re-analysis of the Atlantic hurricane database is being attempted that will be completed in three years . In addition to the groundbreaking work by Partagas , additional analyses , digitization and quality control of the data was carried out by researchers at the NOAA Hurricane Research Division funded by the NOAA Office of Global Programs . Over the next two years , this re-analysis will continue to progress through the remainder of the 20th Century . Over 5000 additions and alterations are now approved for the 1851 to 1910 era by the National Hurricane Center 's Best Track Change Committee . ( This same process was utilized for the upgrade of 1992 's Hurricane Andrew to a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale last August . ) This work on historical hurricanes was originally conducted by the late Jose Fernandez Partagas . Additional analyses , digitization and quality control of the data was carried out by researchers at the NOAA Hurricane Research Division funded by NOAA Office of Global Programs . Over the next two years , this re-analysis will continue to progress through the remainder of the 20th Century . Official changes to the Atlantic hurricane database are approved by the National Hurricane Center Best Track Change Committee . Thus research conducted by Chris Landsea and colleagues as part of the Atlantic hurricane database reanalysis project likewise goes through this review process . Not all Landsea 's recommendations are accepted by the Committee .
A medical abortion is a type of non-surgical abortion in which abortifacient pharmaceutical drugs are used to induce abortion . Medical abortion became an alternative method of abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the early 1970s and the antiprogestogen mifepristone in the 1980s . The most common early first-trimester medical abortion regimens use mifepristone in combination with a prostaglandin analog ( i.e. misoprostol ) up to 63 days gestation , methotrexate in combination with a prostaglandin analog ( i.e. misoprostol ) up to 49 days gestation , or a prostaglandin analog ( i.e. misoprostol ) alone where . Mifepristoneâ `` misoprostol combination regimens work faster and are more effective at later gestational ages than methotrexateâ `` misoprostol combination regimens . Mifepristoneâ `` misoprostol and methotrexateâ `` misoprostol combination regimens are more effective than misoprostol alone . Medical abortion regimens using mifepristone in combination with a prostaglandin ( e.g. misoprostol or gemeprost ) are the most common methods used to induce second-trimester abortions in Canada , most of Europe , China and India ; in contrast to the United States where 96 % of second-trimester abortions are performed surgically by dilation and evacuation . The early first-trimester medical abortion regimen ( 200 mg of oral mifepristone , followed 24 â `` 48 hours later by 800 mcg of buccal misoprostol ) currently used by Planned Parenthood clinics in the United States since April 2006 is 98.3 % effective through 59 days gestation . In the United States in 2009 , the median price charged for a medical abortion up to 9 weeks gestation was $ 490 , four percent higher than the $ 470 median price charged for a surgical abortion at 10 weeks gestation . In the United States in 2008 , 57 % of women who had abortions paid for them out of pocket . A Guttmacher Institute survey of abortion providers estimated that medical abortions accounted for 17 % of all abortions and slightly over 25 % of abortions before 9 weeks gestation in the United States in 2008 ; medical abortions accounted for 32 % of first trimester abortions at Planned Parenthood clinics in the United States in 2008 . Medical abortions accounted for 4 % of abortions in Spain in 2009 , 12 % of abortions in the Netherlands in 2008 , 14 % of abortions in Germany in 2009 , 15 % of abortions in Belgium in 2007 , 38 % of abortions in Denmark in 2006 , 40 % of abortions in England and Wales in 2009 , 49 % of abortions in France in 2007 , 57 % of abortions in Iceland in 2009 , 60 % of abortions in Switzerland in 2009 , 68 % of abortions in Sweden in 2009 , 69 % of abortions in Norway in 2009 , 70 % of abortions in Scotland in 2009 , and 76 % of abortions in Finland in 2009 . Reviews in 2004 and 2006 for the WHO Reproductive Health Library found that : Medical methods for first trimester abortion have been demonstrated to be both safe and effective . Regimens that combine mifepristone or methotrexate with a prostaglandin such as misoprostol are more efficacious than a prostaglandin alone . Prostaglandins alone seem to be less effective and more painful than surgical abortion . Evidence is inadequate on the acceptability and side-effects of the two methods . The medical approach avoids the use of anesthetics ; this and the possibility of using it as an outpatient procedure may offer an advantage in under-resourced settings . There is little , if any , difference between medical and surgical abortion in terms of safety and efficacy . Thus , both methods are similar from a medical point of view and there are only very few situations where a recommendation for one or the other method for medical reasons can be given . Medical abortion may be preferred : A retrospective study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in July 2009 of 227,823 women who underwent medical abortion at Planned Parenthood affiliate centers from January 2005 through June 2008 , found that the rate of serious infection after medical abortion declined by 93 % after a change from vaginal to buccal administration of misoprostol combined with the routine administration of doxycycline antibiotics . A table in the 2010 Handbook of Obstetric and Gynecologic Emergencies , 4th edition lists these possible complications of medical and surgical abortion : According to the 2006 WHO Frequently asked clinical questions about medical abortion : There are very few absolute contraindications to medical abortion . They include :
The Governor Edmund G. Brown California Aqueduct is a system of canals , tunnels , and pipelines that conveys water collected from the Sierra Nevada Mountains and valleys of Northern - and Central California to Southern California . The Department of Water Resources ( DWR ) operates and maintains the California Aqueduct , including two pumped-storage hydroelectric plants , Castaic and Gianelli . Gianelli is located at the base of San Luis Dam , which forms San Luis Reservoir , the largest offstream reservoir in the United States . The Castaic Dam and Castaic Power Plant are located on the northern end of Castaic Lake . The aqueduct begins at the San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta at the Banks Pumping Plant which pumps from the Clifton Court Forebay . Water is pumped by the Banks Pumping Plant to the Bethany Reservoir . The reservoir serves as a forebay for the South Bay Aqueduct via the South Bay Pumping Plant . From the Bethany Reservoir the aqueduct flows by gravity approximately 60 m to the O'Neil Forebay at the San Luis Reservoir . From the O'Neil Forebay it flows approximately 16 m to the Dos Amigos Pumping Plant . After Dos Amigos the aqueduct flows about 95 m to where the Coastal Branch splits from the `` main line '' . The split is approximately 16 m south-southeast of Kettleman City . After the coastal branch , the line continues by gravity another 66 m to the Buena Vista Pumping Plant . From the Buena Vista it flows approximately 72 m to the Teerink Pumping Plant . After Teerlink it flows about 2.5 m to the Chrisman Pumping Plant . Chrisman is the last pumping plant before Edmonston Pumping Plant , which is 13 m from Chrisman . South of the plant the coastal branch splits off in a southwesterly direction to serve the central coast . At Edmonston Pumping Plant it is pumped 1926 f over the Tehachapi Mountains . Water flows through the aqueduct in a series of abrupt rises and gradual falls . The water flows down a long segment , built at a slight grade , and arrives at a pumping station powered by Path 66 or Path 15 . The pumping station raises the water , where it again gradually flows downhill to the next station . However , where there are substantial drops , the water 's potential energy is recaptured by hydroelectric plants . The initial pumping station fed by the Sacramento River Delta raises the water 240 f , while a series of pumps culminating at the Edmonston Pumping Plant raises the water 1926 f over the Tehachapi Mountains . The Edmonston Pumping station requires so much power that several power lines off of Path 15 and Path 26 are needed to ensure proper operation of the pumps . A typical section has a concrete-lined channel 40 f at the base and an average water depth of about 30 f. The widest section of the aqueduct is 110 f and the deepest is 32 f. Channel capacity is 13100 f and the largest pumping plant capacity at Dos Amigos is 15450 f. From its beginning until its first branch , the aqueduct passes through parts of Contra Costa , Alameda , San Joaquin , Stanislaus , Merced , Fresno , and Kings counties . The aqueduct then divides into three branches : the Coastal Branch in the Central Valley ; and the East - and West-Branches after passing over the Tehachapi Mountains . The Coastal Branch splits from the main line 11.3 m south-southeast of Kettleman City transiting Kings County , Kern County , San Luis Obispo County , and Santa Barbara County to deliver water to the coastal cities of San Luis Obispo , Santa Maria , and Santa Barbara . Coastal Branch is 116 m and five pump stations . Phase I , an above ground aqueduct totals 15 m from where it branches from the California Aqueduct , was completed in 1968 . With construction beginning in 1994 , Phase II consists of 101 m of a 42 - diameter buried pipeline extending from the Devils Den Pump Plant , and terminates at Tank 5 on Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara County . The Central Coast Water Authority ( CCWA ) extension , completed in 1997 , is a ( 30 â `` 39 in ) ( 76 â `` 99 cm ) diameter pipeline that travels 42 m from Vandenberg through Vandenberg Village , Lompoc , Buellton , and Solvang where it terminates at Lake Cachuma in Los Padres National Forest . The aqueduct splits off into the East Branch and West Branch in extreme southern Kern County , north of the Los Angeles County line . The East Branch supplies Lake Palmdale and terminates at Lake Perris , in the area of the San Gorgonio Pass . It passes through parts of Kern , Los Angeles , San Bernardino , and Riverside counties . The West Branch continues to head towards its terminus at Pyramid Lake and Castaic Lake in the Angeles National Forest to supply the western Los Angeles basin . It passes through parts of Kern and Los Angeles counties . When it was open , the California Aqueduct Bikeway was the longest of the paved paths in the Los Angeles area , at 107 m long from Quail Lake near Gorman through the desert to Silverwood Lake in the San Bernardino Mountains . This path was closed in 1988 due to bicyclist safety and liability issues . It is expected to remain closed indefinitely due to the continued liability issues and an increased focus on security , especially after the September 11 , 2001 attacks .
Magnus Carl Hedman ( born 19 March 1973 in Huddinge ) is a Swedish former football goalkeeper . He played 58 matches for the Sweden national football team , and represented his country at two FIFA World Cup and two European Championship tournaments . He is recently divorced from Magdalena Graaf , a Swedish author , former model and pop singer . The couple have three sons together . Hedman started his career with AIK in 1990 . He won the 1992 Allsvenskan championship with AIK , and was chosen as a backup for first-choice keeper Thomas Ravelli at the 1994 World Cup . He debuted for the Swedish national team in February 1997 , and moved abroad to play for English club Coventry City in July that year . Hedman was chosen for the Swedish squad at the Euro 2000 where he played all Sweden 's matches and conceded goals from Bart Goor and Emile Mpenza against Belgium and from Luigi Di Biagio and Alessandro Del Piero against Italy ( both lost 2-1 ) . The other match , against Turkey , was 0-0 draw . He won the 2000 Guldbollen award . He also played full time for Sweden at the 2002 World Cup . Hedman was replaced by future England international Chris Kirkland in the Coventry City team during their relegation from the FA Premier League in the 2000\/01 season . He regained his place following Kirkland 's transfer to Liverpool after a single game of the 2001\/02 season . His Coventry City career came to an acrimonious conclusion towards the end of that season , when he was approached on the pitch during an away match against Preston North End on 6 April 2002 by a ` fan ' who was questioning his commitment to the club and desire to play in the Football League Championship . Hedman played two further games for Coventry that season before moving on to Celtic in the Scottish Premier League in 2002 . He had a loan spell at Italian team A.C. Ancona in 2004 , a time in which he later claimed to have witnessed bribery on part of his Ancona teammates . While at Ancona , he was chosen to represent Sweden at the Euro 2004 , where he served as a back-up for keeper Andreas Isaksson . He played a further season for Celtic , before being released at the start of the 2005\/06 season . He then retired from professional football . In September 2006 , he was rumored to be making a sensational comeback at English FA Premier League club Newcastle United . According to himself he denied an offer from the club , citing it was too short of a contract to be interesting . The club itself has denied ever contacting the goalkeeper . On 9 November 2006 it was announced that Hedman would join FA Premier League Champions Chelsea on a week 's trial , due to Chelsea 's current lack of fully fit goalkeepers except for Henrique HilÃ rio and youth team keeper Yves Makalambay . The move was eventually completed on 14 November 2006 , taking the No. 22 shirt previously worn by Eidur Gudjohnsen . Hedman has since been released from his contract , having made no official appearances for Chelsea . In November 2008 he claimed he was approached by Manchester City to provide back up following the injury to their current number 1 Joe Hart . Hedman began training with Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur on 5 January 2009 , with a view to gaining a contract with Spurs until at least the end of the 2008 â `` 09 season .
Teruyuki Moniwa is a Japanese football ( soccer ) player who currenttly plays for J. League side Cerezo Osaka . The centre-back started his professional career at J. League Division 2 side Bellmare Hiratsuka . He was a first-choice defender but had to be transferred due to club 's financial difficulties . He made his international debut for Japan in a friendly against Tunisia on October 8 , 2003 . He scored his first international goal on August 3 , 2005 against People 's Republic of China in an East Asian Cup match . He was a member of Japan at the 2004 Olympics and was a late entry in Japan 's 2006 World Cup squad , called up after Makoto Tanaka was injured when he was spending his vacation in Hawaii . He replaced Keisuke Tsuboi in the 56th minute of Japan 's first match against Australia after Tsuboi suffered from cramps in both thighs .
Nino Bule ( born 19 March 1976 in Ä apljina , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Yugoslavia ) is a Croatian footballer who plays as a striker . His current club is NK Lokomotiva of the Prva HNL in Croatia . He won three caps for the Croatian national team in friendly matches , last of which was against Germany in 2004 . He also played in two friendly matches for the Croatian national B team , and was also a member of the country 's under-21 team in 1997 , scoring two goals in four appearances .
In probability theory and statistics , a probability distribution identifies either the probability of each value of a random variable ( when the variable is discrete ) , or the probability of the value falling within a particular interval ( when the variable is continuous ) . The probability distribution describes the range of possible values that a random variable can attain and the probability that the value of the random variable is within any ( measurable ) subset of that range . When the random variable takes values in the set of real numbers , the probability distribution is completely described by the cumulative distribution function , whose value at each real x is the probability that the random variable is smaller than or equal to x. The concept of the probability distribution and the random variables which they describe underlies the mathematical discipline of probability theory , and the science of statistics . There is spread or variability in almost any value that can be measured in a population ( e.g. height of people , durability of a metal , sales growth , traffic flow , etc. ) ; almost all measurements are made with some intrinsic error ; in physics many processes are described probabilistically , from the kinetic properties of gases to the quantum mechanical description of fundamental particles . For these and many other reasons , simple numbers are often inadequate for describing a quantity , while probability distributions are often more appropriate . There are various probability distributions that show up in different applications . Two of the most important ones are the normal distribution and the categorical distribution . The normal distribution , also known as the Gaussian distribution , has a familiar `` bell curve '' shape and approximates many different naturally occurring distributions over real numbers . The categorical distribution describes the result of an experiment with a fixed , finite number of outcomes . For example , the toss of a fair coin is a categorical distribution , where the possible outcomes are heads and tails , each with probability 1\/2 . In the measure-theoretic formalization of probability theory , a random variable is defined as a measurable function X from a probability space to measurable space . A probability distribution is the pushforward measure X \* P = PX â ' 1 on . A probability distribution is called discrete if its cumulative distribution function only increases in jumps . More precisely , a probability distribution is discrete if there is a finite or countable set whose probability is 1 . For many familiar discrete distributions , the set of possible values is topologically discrete in the sense that all its points are isolated points . But , there are discrete distributions for which this countable set is dense on the real line . By one convention , a probability distribution is called continuous if its cumulative distribution function is continuous and , therefore , the probability measure of singletons for all . Another convention reserves the term continuous probability distribution for absolutely continuous distributions . These distributions can be characterized by a probability density function : a non-negative Lebesgue integrable function defined on the real numbers such that Discrete distributions and some continuous distributions ( like the Cantor distribution ) do not admit such a density . The support of a distribution is the smallest closed interval\/set whose complement has probability zero . It may be understood as the points or elements that are actual members of the distribution . A discrete random variable is a random variable whose probability distribution is discrete . Similarly , a continuous random variable is a random variable whose probability distribution is continuous . The following is a list of some of the most common probability distributions , grouped by the type of process that they are related to . For a more complete list , see list of probability distributions , which groups by the nature of the outcome being considered ( discrete , continuous , multivariate , etc. ) Note also that all of the univariate distributions below are singly-peaked ; that is , it is assumed that the values cluster around a single point . In practice , actually-observed quantities may cluster around multiple values . Such quantities can be modeled using a mixture distribution .

Valdosaurus ( `` Weald Lizard '' ) is a genus of bipedal herbivorous iguanodont ornithopod dinosaur found on the Isle of Wight and elsewhere in England . It lived during the Early Cretaceous . In the nineteenth century Reverend William Darwin Fox collected two small thighbones near Cowleaze Chine on the southwest coast of the Isle of Wight . In 1868 he incorrectly suggested these may have come from the same individual that had in 1848 been uncovered for Gideon Mantell as a fossil of Iguanodon , and which in 1869 would be named as the new genus Hypsilophodon . Regardless , both femora , made part of the collection of the British Museum of Natural History as specimens BMNH R184 and BMNH R185 , would be commonly referred to the latter genus . However , in 1975 Peter Galton named them as a new species of Dryosaurus : Dryosaurus canaliculatus . The specific name means `` with a small channel '' in Latin , referring to a distinct groove between the condyles of the lower thighbone . In 1977 Galton named a new genus for them : Valdosaurus , the name being derived from Latin Valdus , `` Wealden '' , a reference to the Wealden Group . Its type species , D. canaliculatus , was thus renamed V. canaliculatus . A second species , V. nigeriensis , was described by Galton and Philippe Taquet from younger rocks from Niger in 1982 . In 1998 William Blows inadvertently named another species , Valdosaurus dextrapoda , by including this name in a fauna list , but this was an error , and the species has never been supported . Lacking description , it is a nomen nudum . Having a close European relative of the American form Dryosaurus named led to most of the dryosaurid fossil material of Europe being referred to Valdosaurus . Valdosaurus was seen as not only present in England ( the Wessex Formation of the Isle of Wight and the Hastings Beds of West Sussex ) but also in Romania ( the Cornet Bauxite of Bihor ) and Spain . These rock units were deposited between the Berriasian and Barremian stages , between approximately 145 and 125 million years ago . V. canaliculatus would then be known from thigh bones , extensive additional postcranial elements , partial lower jaws , and teeth . In 2009 however , Galton critically reviewed the Valdosaurus material . He concluded that no fossils from outside of England could be reliably referred to the genus . He thus gave V. nigeriensis its own genus : Elrhazosaurus . Even of many of the English specimens it was uncertain whether they belonged to Valdosaurus , including all cranial elements and teeth . Some hindlimb and pelvis bones from the Upper Wealden Clay Formation ( late Barremian ) were referable to V. canaliculatus . Some material from the earlier Hastings Beds ( Valanginian ) were referred to a Valdosaurus sp . Galton established that Richard Owen had in 1842 been the first to describe Valdosaurus thighbones , specimens BMB 004297-004300 , assigning them to Iguanodon . Galton emphasized that though the type femora were very small , fourteen centimetres long ( which has led to estimates of a length of 1.2 metres and a weight of ten kilograms ) , these were from a juvenile individual and that an adult would have been a `` medium-sized euornithopod '' , with some thighbones reaching a length of half a metre . Galton assigned Valdosaurus to the Hypsilophodontidae , but this paraphyletic unnatural group has largely been abandoned . Today Valdosaurus is generally considered a member of the Dryosauridae .
Vaisakhi ( , ' , also known as Baisakhi or Vasakhi ) is an ancient harvest festival in the Punjab region , which also marks beginning of a new solar year , and new harvest season . Baisakhi is a Sikh religious festival . It falls on the first day of the Baisakh month in the solar Nanakshahi calendar , which corresponds to April 13 in the Gregorian calendar . In Sikhism , it is one of the most significant holidays in the Sikh calendar , commemorating the establishment of the Khalsa at Anandpur Sahib in 1699 , by the 10th Sikh Guru , Guru Gobind Singh . This day is also observed as the beginning of the Hindu solar new year celebrated by the people of Nepal and India in Assam Valley , Kerala , Orissa , West Bengal and some other regions of India . The particular significance attached to the occasion shows regional variation outside of Punjab too . In Himachal Pradesh , the Hindu Goddess Jwalamukhi is worshipped on Vaisakhi , while in Bihar , the Sun-god Surya is honored . The festival is celebrated as Rongali Bihu in Assam , Naba Barsha or Pohela Boishakh in Bengal and Tripura , Puthandu ( Tamil New Year ) in Tamil Nadu , Vishu ( or Vaishakhi ) in Kerala , Bikhu or Bikhauti in the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand , Maha Vishuba Sankranti ( or Pana Sankranti ) in Orissa , and the Sinhalese New Year festival in Sri Lanka . Besides in Punjab , Baisakhi is widely celebrated as a traditional harvest festival in many northern states of India , such as Haryana , Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand . In many places the day is marked by ritualistic bathing in sacred rivers like the Ganges . To mark the celebrations , devotees , irrespective of Sikh religion , attend the gurdwara , a Sikh place of worship . The celebrations start early as devotees , with flowers and offerings in their hands , proceed towards the gurdwara before dawn . Processions through towns are also common . Baisakhi is the day on which the Khalsa ( The Pure Ones ) was born and Sikhs were given a clear identity and a code of conduct to live by . The momentous occasion was led by the last living Sikh spiritual teacher , Guru Gobind Singh Ji , who baptized the first Sikhs using sweet nectar called Amrit . Around the world at Baisakhi time , Sikhs and individuals of Punjabi descent reflect on the values taught to them by their gurus and celebrate the birth of the Khalsa . Baisakhi is widely celebrated by Sikhs in Punjab , with festivities centered on the Panja Sahib complex in Hassan Abdal , numerous shrines in Nanakana Sahib , and in various historical sites in Lahore . It is culturally and traditionally regarded as an important and significant Punjabi festival , and this is further exemplified by the thousands of Sikh pilgrims from India arriving each year to commemorate the day at the sacred Sikh sites of Nankana Sahib and Hasan Abdal in the country . Further , local Muslims and Hindus also partake in celebrations , albeit with secular intentions , rather than religious conviction . On April 2009 , the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee more recently announced official plans for formally organising the event on a larger scale in the country as well as expressing intentions for elegant arrangements . In 2010 , over 20,000 Indian pilgrims were expected to arrive in Pakistan for the celebrations , a significant increase over previous years . The main celebration takes place at Talwandi Sabo ( where Guru Gobind Singh stayed for nine months and completed the recompilation of the Guru Granth Sahib ) , and in the gurdwara at Anandpur Sahib , the birth place of Khalsa and at the Golden Temple in Amritsar . The celebration of vaisakhi held at Anandpur Sahib on 13th April 1699 was the birthday of KHALSA . So , Baisakhi is not merely a start of new season but is also a celebration of the Khalsa 's birthday In the United States , there is usually a parade commemorating the Baisakhi celebration . In Manhattan , New York City people come out to do `` seva '' ( religious work ) such as giving out free food , and completing any other labor that needs to be done . In Los Angeles , California , the local Sikh community consisting of more than 20 Gurdwaras or Sikh Temples holds a full day kirtan or spiritual music program followed by a two mile parade in downtown Los Angeles with an estimated 15,000 participants . The local Sikh community in Vancouver , Abbotsford and Surrey , British Columbia , Canada holds its annual Baisakhi celebrations in the April long weekend , which often includes a nagar kirtan , or parade , which an estimated 200,000 people attend . Sikh populations within the UK and the US celebrate with city parades consisting of floats , and free food being offered . These celebrations are often organized by the community and local gurdwaras .
In 1899 he returned to work in Germany , taking on some of the stylistic trappings of Impressionism ; this , coupled with time spent working with Ilya Repin , influenced his later style . Later in his career , most especially during and after World War I , he began to teach , from 1915 working as a drawing instructor at the Tallinn Institute of Commerce and from 1923 at the State School of Industrial Art in Tallinn . A weather or sounding balloon is a balloon ( specifically a type of high altitude balloon ) which carries instruments aloft to send back information on atmospheric pressure , temperature , humidity and wind speed by means of a small , expendable measuring device called a radiosonde . To obtain wind data , they can be tracked by radar , radio direction finding , or navigation systems ( such as the satellite based Global Positioning System ( GPS ) . The balloon itself produces the lift , and is usually made of a highly flexible latex material , though Chloroprene may also be used . The unit that performs the actual measurements and radio transmissions hangs at the lower end of the string , and is called a radiosonde . Specialized radiosondes are used for measuring particular parameters , such as determining the ozone concentration . The balloon is usually filled with hydrogen due to lower cost , though helium can also be used . The ascent rate can be controlled by the amount of gas with which the balloon is filled . Weather balloons may reach altitudes of 40 km ( 25 miles ) or more , limited by diminishing pressures causing the balloon to expand to such a degree ( typically by a 100:1 factor ) that it disintegrates . In this instance the instrument package is usually lost . Above that altitude sounding rockets are used , and for even higher altitudes satellites are used . Major manufacturers of balloons are Zhuzhou Research & Design Institute , Chemchina Rubber Corp ( Brand : Hwoyee ) ( China ) , Totex and Cosmopren of Japan , Pawan Rubber Products ( Pawan Exports ) of India , Kaysam ( now Kaymont ) , and Scientific Sales , Inc. of the U.S. . Weather balloons are sometimes cited as the cause of unidentified flying object sightings , and are also used for cluster ballooning . Weather balloons are launched around the world for observations used to diagnose current conditions as well as by human forecasters and computer models for weather forecasting . About 800 locations around the globe do routine releases , twice daily , usually at 0000 UTC and 1200 UTC . Some facilities will also do occasional supplementary `` special '' releases when meteorologists determine there is a need for additional data between the 12 hour routine launches in which time much can change in the atmosphere . Military and civilian government meteorological agencies such as the National Weather Service in the US typically launch balloons , and by international agreements almost all the data is shared with all nations . Specialized uses also exist , such as for aviation interests , pollution monitoring , photography or videography and research .

Information technology ( IT ) is the acquisition , processing , storage and dissemination of vocal , pictorial , textual and numerical information by a microelectronics-based combination of computing and telecommunications . The term in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review , in which authors Leavitt and Whisler commented that `` the new technology does not yet have a single established name . We shall call it information technology . '' IT is the area of managing technology and spans wide variety of areas that include but are not limited to things such as processes , computer software , information systems , computer hardware , programming languages , and data constructs . In short , anything that renders data , information or perceived knowledge in any visual format whatsoever , via any multimedia distribution mechanism , is considered part of the domain space known as Information Technology ( IT ) . IT professionals perform a variety of functions ( IT Disciplines\/Competencies ) that range from installing applications to designing complex computer networks and information databases . A few of the duties that IT professionals perform may include data management , networking , engineering computer hardware , database and software design , as well as management and administration of entire systems . Information technology is starting to spread farther than the conventional personal computer and network technology , and more into integrations of other technologies such as the use of cell phones , televisions , automobiles , and more , which is increasing the demand for such jobs . In the recent past , the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology and the Association for Computing Machinery have collaborated to form accreditation and curriculum standards for degrees in Information Technology as a distinct field of study as compared to Computer Science and Information Systems today . SIGITE ( Special Interest Group for IT Education ) is the ACM working group for defining these standards . The Worldwide IT services revenue totaled $ 763 billion in 2009 .
The Shambhala Encyclopedia of Yoga , Shambhala Publications , Boston , 2000 p. 321 , 350 . 85 Io is a large , dark main-belt asteroid of the C spectral class . It is probably a primitive body composed of carbonates . Like 70 Panopaea it orbits within the Eunomia asteroid family but it is not related to the shattered parent body . Io is a retrograde rotator , with its pole pointing towards one of ecliptic coordinates ( Î , Î '' ) = ( -45 Â , 105 Â ) or ( -15 Â , 295 Â ) with a 10 Â uncertainty . ( 1 ) This gives an axial tilt of about 125 Â or 115 Â , respectively . Its shape is quite regular . It was discovered by C. H. F. Peters on September 19 , 1865 , and named after Io , a lover of Zeus in Greek mythology . An Ionian diameter of 178 kilometres was measured from an occultation of a star on December 10 , 1995 . ( 4 ) Another asteroid occultation of Io ( magnitude 13.2 ) occurred on March 12 , 2009 , from the eastern USA , with the star 2UCAC 35694429 ( magnitude 13.8 ) .

The British Rail Class 318 is an electric multiple unit ( EMU ) train , which operates exclusively in the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport network in West Central Scotland . The units were introduced fully on 29 September 1986 as part of the electrification of the Ayrshire Coast Line between and \/ Ardrossan with alternating current ( AC ) overhead lines . Usage was extended to in January 1987 . They were also used on the Inverclyde Line in small numbers . The trains currently operate the Ayrshire Coast Line , Inverclyde Line and the Argyle Line . The trains can also be found very rarely on Cathcart Circle and North Clyde Lines . Effectively a 3-car version of the Class 317 units used in the Network SouthEast region , 21 of these British Rail Mark 3-based units were built by BREL at York works between 1984-1986 , to replace the elderly Class 101 , Class 107 , Class 120 and Class 126 diesel multiple units ( DMUs ) which had worked the Glasgow South Western sector for nearly 30 years . The technical description of the units are DTSO+MSO+DTSO , consisting of a central motor car ( with a roof mounted Stone Faiveley AMBR pantograph and four Brush TM2141 traction motors located under the floor within both bogies ( two motors per a bogie ) ) with a driving trailer at either end . The units run on the standard 25 kV AC overhead line system , and are standard class throughout , with one toilet located in the rearmost driving trailer . Up to four sets can be worked in multiple to form a 12-car set , although platforms are only capable of handling 6-car trains . The units have a maximum speed of 90 mph , and can complete the 41 mile journey between Glasgow Central and Ayr in around 52 minutes . Since the introduction of the Class 334 units onto the Ayrshire Coast route , most 318s have been found working alongside the 334 fleet . During the late 1990s , the Class 318 units underwent a minor refitting which involved replacing the seats with new seating in the newer corporate colors . It is unclear whether this was necessary due to normal wear or was just an improvement . Some sections also had a small table fitted between the seats . The repainting of the fleet was also undertaken gradually at this time . In July 1995 , units 318254 and 318262 were operating a Glasgow Central to Largs service when a braking system failure resulted in the train overshooting the end of the platform at Largs railway station . The train crashed through shops at the front of the station , and out into Main Street , Largs . Being very early in the morning , there were no serious injuries . The cab of vehicle 77244 ( from set 318254 ) needed to be completely rebuilt . 318262 managed to move by rail back to Shields depot . The reconstruction of the Largs railway station building took almost ten years to complete . On 3 September 2007 , unit 318254 derailed near Exhibition Centre railway station in Glasgow . The train , which ran ECS from Anderston railway station after terminating there and reversed to head back to Anderston to take up its next service , was empty apart from a driver , a trainee , an instructor and a ticket examiner . Two of the four were injured and the others walked away unharmed . This is the same unit that was involved in the Largs rail crash . 318254 is still in service today . All Class 318s have recently undergone a conversion process which involves the removal of the corridor connection on the driver 's cars . Although one may see this as detrimental to passenger operations , there have been no great problems with the Class 334 or Class 320 units which also have no corridor connections . Apart from ` cleaning up ' the appearance of the driver 's cars , this allows the driver to have a far more spacious operating environment and gives the driver a better overall view . In appearance , modified units are very similar to the first batch of Class 150 diesel `` sprinters '' , which were also based upon the Mark 3 bodyshell but lacked end corridors . The passenger accommodation has also been improved , with new passenger door controls . The interior has been fully repainted in white , and new grab handles have been fitted . New lighting has been fitted , with similar gondolas to the Class 320 units . First ScotRail originally promised new passenger information systems , similar to those seen on other trains . This was not fitted to the first units to undergo refurbishment ( 318251 and 318264 ) ; however , they have been fitted to the subsequent units , and were retrofitted to the initial units later . The voice used in the audio announcement systems ( in line with other First ScotRail services ) , is that of Scottish actress Fletcher Mathers . The system is based on the one used in Class 320 units rather than the Class 334 units . The Class 318 units were refurbished at Hunslet-Barclay , Kilmarnock from between 2005 and 2007 . The Class 318s will operate Argyle Line services by May 2011 . In September 2008 the Scottish Government 's agency Transport Scotland announced that all ScotRail trains ( including from the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport ) would be eventually repainted in a new , blue livery with white Saltire markings on the carriage ends . This will include all Class 318s .

The term `` hermaphrodite '' derives from Hermaphroditus , the son of Hermes and Aphrodite in Greek mythology , who was fused with a nymph , Salmacis , resulting in one individual possessing physical traits of both sexes . The epididymis ( , plural : epididymides \/ É pÉ Ë dÉ dÉ Ë miË diË z \/ ) is part of the male reproductive system and is present in all male amniotes . It is a narrow , tightly-coiled tube connecting the efferent ducts from the rear of each testicle to its vas deferens . A similar , but probably non-homologous , structure is found in cartilaginous fishes . In reptiles , there is an additional canal between the testis and the head of the epididymis , which receives the various efferent ducts . This is , however , absent in all birds and mammals . The epididymis is covered by a pseudostratified epithelium . The epithelium is separated by a basement membrane from the connective tissue wall which has smooth muscle cells . The major cell types in the epithelium are : Spermatozoa formed in the testis enter the caput epididymis , progress to the corpus , and finally reach the cauda region , where they are stored . Sperm entering the caput epididymis are incomplete - they lack the ability to swim forward ( motility ) and to fertilize an egg . During their transit in the epididymis , sperm undergo maturation processes necessary for them to acquire these functions . Final maturation is completed in the female reproductive tract ( capacitation ) . During ejaculation , sperm flow from the lower portion of the epididymis ( which functions as a storage reservoir ) . They have not been activated by products from the prostate gland , and they are unable to swim , but are transported via the peristaltic action of muscle layers within the vas deferens , and are mixed with the diluting fluids of the seminal vesicles and other accessory glands prior to ejaculation ( forming semen ) . The epididymis possesses numerous , long atypical microvilli . These processes are often called stereocilia ; this is incorrect , as they neither contain the microtubular structures of cilia nor function like cilia . An inflammation of the epididymis is called epididymitis . A Gartner 's duct is a homologous remnant in the female . In the embryo , the epididymis develops from tissue that once formed the mesonephros , a primitive kidney found in many aquatic vertebrates . Persistence of the cranial end of the mesonephric duct will leave behind a remnant called the appendix of the epididymis . In addition , some mesonephric tubules can persist as the paradidymis , a small body caudal to the efferent ductules .
Terrain , or land relief , is the vertical and horizontal dimension of land surface . When relief is described underwater , the term bathymetry is used . In America , topography has recently become an additional synonym , though in many parts of the world it retains its original more general meaning of description of place . Terrain is used as a general term in physical geography , referring to the lie of the land . This is usually expressed in terms of the elevation , slope , and orientation of terrain features . Terrain affects surface water flow and distribution . Over a large area , it can affect weather and climate patterns . Geomorphology is in large part the study of the formation of terrain or topography . Terrain is formed by intersecting processes : Tectonic processes such as orogenies cause land to be elevated , and erosional or weathering processes cause land to be worn away to lower elevations . Land surface parameters are quantitative measures of various morphometric properties of a surface . The most common examples are used to derive slope or aspect of a terrain or curvatures at each location . These measures can also be used to derive hydrological parameters that reflect flow\/erosion processes . Climatic parameters are based on the modelling of solar radiation or air flow . Land surface objects , or landforms , are definite physical objects ( lines , points , areas ) that differ from the surrounding objects . The most typical examples arelines of watersheds , stream patterns , ridges , break-lines , pools or borders of specific landforms .
Cao Xueqin ( , 1724 or 1715 â '' 1763 or 1764 ) was a Qing Dynasty Chinese writer , best known as the author of Dream of the Red Chamber , one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature . His given name was Cao Zhan ( æ é ` ) and his courtesy name is Mengruan ( å cents é ; æ cents é ; literally `` Dream about Ruan '' or `` Dream of Ruan '' ) . Cao belonged to a Han Chinese clan , which later became part of the Plain White Branch ( æ # ç 1\/2 æ -- -- ) of the Manchu Eight Banners . Although forced into slavery ( as booi ) to Manchu royalty in the late 1610s , his ancestors distinguished themselves through military service and subsequently held posts as officials . During the Kangxi Emperor 's reign , the clan 's prestige and power reached its height . Cao 's grandfather , Cao Yin ( æ å Two years after his ascension , Kangxi appointed Cao 's great-grandfather , Cao Xi ( æ ç ' 1\/2 ) , as the Commissioner of Imperial Textiles ( ç '' é ) in Jiangning . When Cao Xi died in 1684 , Cao Yin , as Kangxi 's personal confidante , took over the post . Cao Yin was one of the era 's most prominent men of letters and a keen book collector . By the early 18th century , the Cao clan had become so rich and influential as to be able to play host four times to the Kangxi Emperor in his six separate itinerant trips south to the Nanjing region . When Cao Yin died in 1712 , Kangxi , still in power , passed the office over to Cao Yin 's only son , Cao Yong ( æ é ' ) . Cao Yong died in 1715 . Kangxi then allowed the family to adopt a paternal nephew , Cao Fu ( æ é `` ) , as Cao Yin 's posthumous son to continue in that position . Hence the clan held the office of Imperial Textile Commissioner at Jiangning for three generations . The family 's fortunes lasted until Kangxi 's death and the ascension of the Yongzheng Emperor to the throne . Yongzheng was much less tolerant of the debts the family chalked up in office . By 1727 , after a series of warnings , he decided to confiscate the Cao clan 's properties , including their mansion , and put Cao Fu under arrest . Many believe this purge was politically motivated . When Cao Fu was released a year later , the family , totally impoverished , was forced to relocate to Beijing . Cao Xueqin , still a young child then , followed the family in this odyssey . Almost no records of Cao 's early childhood and adulthood survive . Redology scholars are still debating Cao 's exact date of birth , though he is known to be around forty to fifty at his death . Cao was the son of either Cao Fu or Cao Yong . It is known for certain that Cao Yong 's only son was born posthumously in 1715 ; some Redologists believe this son might be Cao Xueqin . Most of what we know about Cao was passed down from his contemporaries and friends . Cao eventually settled in the western suburbs of Beijing where he lived the larger part of his later years in poverty selling off his paintings . Cao was recorded as an inveterate drinker . Friends and acquaintances recalled an intelligent , highly talented man who spent a decade working diligently on a work that must have been Dream of the Red Chamber . They praised both his stylish paintings , particularly of cliffs and rocks , and originality in poetry , which they likened to Li He 's . Cao died some time in 1763 or 1764 , leaving his novel in a very advanced stage of completion . ( The first draft had been completed , some pages of the manuscript were lost after being borrowed by friends or relatives , but Cao apparently had not finished a final version . ) He was survived by a wife after the death of a son . Cao achieved posthumous fame through his life 's work . The novel , written in `` blood and tears '' , as a commentator friend said , is a vivid recreation of an illustrious family at its height and its subsequent downfall . A small group of close family and friends appears to have been transcribing his manuscript when Cao died quite suddenly in 1763-4 , apparently out of grief owing to the death of a son . Extant handwritten copies of this work â `` some 80 chapters â `` had been in circulation in Beijing shortly after Cao 's death and scribal copies soon became prized collectors ' items . In 1791 , Cheng Weiyuan ( ç å å This is its first moveable type print edition . Reprinted a year later with more revisions , this 120-chapter edition is the novel 's most printed version . Modern scholars generally think the authorship of the 1791 ending â `` the last 40 chapters â `` to be in doubt .

Popularity is the quality of being well-liked or common , or having a high social status . Popularity figures are an important part of many people 's personal value systems and form a vital component of success in people-oriented fields such as management , politics , and entertainment , among others . Borrowed from the Latin popularis in 1490 , originally meant common or `` being well-liked '' . The use of the word popular to mean the `` fact or condition of being well liked by the people '' is seen originally in 1601 . Many different variations of popularity exist , and many ways in which to gain it . General popularity usually involves respect in two directions : a popular person is respected by peers and will reciprocate that respect , thus reinforcing the belief of deserving the popularity . Likewise , amicability is an important component of popularity , as a person who does not like others is unlikely to be liked by others . This reciprocal nature of interpersonal popularity is often overlooked by people ( particularly the young ) who are attempting to become popular : being loud may be successful in gaining attention , but is unlikely to provide mutual respect . Neuroimaging identifies the anterior insula and anterior cingulate as key areas in the brain determining whether people prefer something in regard to its being popular with their peer group . The influence of one 's peer group upon is strongest during adolescence .

Virgin Group Limited is a British branded venture capital conglomerate organization founded by business tycoon Richard Branson . The core business areas are travel , entertainment and lifestyle . Virgin Group 's date of incorporation is listed as 1989 by Companies House , who class it as a holding company ; however Virgin 's business and trading activities date to the 1970s . The net worth of Virgin Group Ltd as of September 2008 is Â # 5.01 billion . It consists of more than 400 companies around the world . Virgin Group operates from its headquarters at The School House , 50 Brook Green in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham . Although Branson retains complete ownership and control of the Virgin Brand , the commercial set-up of companies using it is varied and complex . Each of the companies operating under the Virgin brand is a separate entity , with Branson completely owning some and holding minority or majority stakes in others . Occasionally , he simply licenses the brand to a company that has purchased a division from him , such as Virgin Mobile USA , Virgin Mobile Australia , Virgin Radio and Virgin Music ( now part of EMI ) . The brand name `` Virgin '' arose when Branson and a partner were starting their first business , a record shop . They considered themselves virgins in business . The current Virgin logo was originally sketched on a paper napkin and remains largely unchanged since 1979 .
A laboratory ( lÉ Ë bÉ ' rÉ tÉ ri , Ë lÃ bÉ rÉ tri ; informally , lab ) is a facility that provides controlled conditions in which scientific research , experiments , and measurement may be performed . The title of laboratory is also used for certain other facilities where the processes or equipment used are similar to those in scientific laboratories . These notably include : In recent years government and private centers for innovation in learning , leadership and organization have adopted `` lab '' in their name to emphasize the experimental and research-oriented nature of their work . Scientific laboratories can be found in schools and universities , in industry , in government or military facilities , and even aboard ships and spacecraft . A laboratory might offer work space for just one to more than thirty researchers depending on its size and purpose . Labs used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing requirements of specialists in the various fields of science . A physics lab might contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber , while a metallurgy lab could have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their strength . A chemist or biologist might use a wet laboratory , while a psychologist 's lab might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior . In some laboratories , such as those commonly used by computer scientists , computers ( sometimes supercomputers ) are used for either simulations or the analysis of data collected elsewhere . Scientists in other fields will use still other types of laboratories . Despite the great differences among laboratories , some features are common . The use of workbenches or countertops at which the scientist may choose to either sit or stand is a common way to ensure comfortable working conditions for the researcher , who may spend a large portion of his or her working day in the laboratory . The provision of cabinets for the storage of laboratory equipment is quite common . It is traditional for a scientist to record an experiment 's progress in a laboratory notebook , but modern labs almost always contain at least one computer workstation for data collection and analysis . In some laboratories , the conditions are no more dangerous than in any other room . In many labs , though , hazards are present . Laboratory hazards are as varied as the subjects of study in laboratories , and might include poisons ; infectious agents ; flammable , explosive , or radioactive materials ; moving machinery ; extreme temperatures ; lasers , strong magnetic fields or high voltage . In laboratories where dangerous conditions might exist , safety precautions are important . Rules exist to minimize the individual 's risk , and safety equipment is used to protect the lab user from injury or to assist in responding to an emergency . The Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) in the United States , recognizing the unique characteristics of the laboratory workplace , has tailored a standard for occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals in laboratories . This standard is often referred to as the `` Laboratory Standard '' . Under this standard , a laboratory is required to produce a Chemical Hygiene Plan ( CHP ) which addresses the specific hazards found in its location , and its approach to them . In determining the proper Chemical Hygiene Plan for a particular business or laboratory , it is necessary to understand the requirements of the standard , evaluation of your current safety , health and environmental practices and assessment of your hazards . The CHP must be reviewed annually . Many schools and businesses employ safety , health , and environmental specialists , such as a Chemical Hygiene Officer ( CHO ) to develop , manage , and evaluate their CHP . Additionally , third party review is also used to provide an objective `` outside view '' which provides a fresh look at areas and problems that may be taken for granted or overlooked due to habit . Inspections and audits should also be conducted on a regular basis to assess hazards due to chemical handling and storage , electrical equipment , biohazards , hazardous waste management , housekeeping and emergency preparedness , radiation safety , ventilation as well as respiratory testing and indoor air quality . An important element of such audits is the review of regulatory compliance and the training of individuals who have access to and\/or work in the laboratory . Training is critical to the ongoing safe operation of the laboratory facility . Educators , staff and management must be engaged in working to reduce the likelihood of accidents , injuries and potential litigation . Efforts are made to ensure laboratory safety videos are both relevant and engaging .

The Roscoe Wind Farm in Roscoe , Texas , owned and operated by E. ON Climate & Renewables is the world 's largest wind farm ( as of October 2009 ) with 627 wind turbines and a total installed capacity of 781.5 MW , which surpasses the nearby 735.5 MW Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center . The project cost more than $ 1 billion and provides enough power for more than 250,000 average Texan homes . It is located about 200 miles ( 320 kilometers ) west of Fort Worth , and spans parts of four Texas counties and covers nearly 100000 a , several times the size of Manhattan . Cliff Etheredge , a local cotton farmer , helped to organize the project . In addition to its large size , the farm is also notable for the large number of individual land owners ( as many as 400 ) who are expected to share in royalties from the project . Wind farms are helping to revive the local economy in remote areas of West Texas and the Texas Panhandle . Unlike fossil-fueled power plants , wind farms require no water and their operation generates no carbon dioxide â '' a heat-trapping greenhouse gas that is a major contributor to global warming .

It is the custom to reward Wikipedia contributors for hard work and due diligence by awarding them a barnstar . To give the award to someone , just place the image on their talk page ( or their awards page ) , and say why you have given it to them . If you are sure the barnstar is appropriate , do n't be shy ! The barnstar is not unique to Wikipedia . Some years ago , some wiki-based communities began to give their users awards called barn stars , using a star anchor to represent the concept of the shared work experience , as in barn raising . The concept of the barnstar as a Wiki award was created by SunirShah on MeatballWiki . Web designers were invited to incorporate a similar barn star design into their project as Easter eggs . Wiki barnstars were introduced to Wikipedia in December 2003 . Since then , the concept has become ingrained in the Wikipedia culture . These awards are part of the Kindness Campaign and are meant to promote civility and WikiLove . They are a form of warm fuzzy : they are free to give and they bring joy to the recipient . While awarding a barnstar , remember to provide relevant and polite text as to why you are awarding it . The following are some of the barnstars and awards currently in use . If you do n't feel any of these covers the topics you are concerned with , you can always design your own award ( using these examples , if you like ) . If you have questions , WikiProject Wikipedia Awards is a group of volunteers who help guide these pages . There are many types of barnstars . Please make sure that your choice is fair and appropriate , which will help prevent over-use . Remember that there are other ways of showing simple appreciation to someone , such as a comment on the user 's talk page , and alternative awards such as cookies in Personal user awards . If you would like a barnstar to be added to the list , please discuss it at WikiProject Wikipedia Awards talk page . Please do n't add it without a consensus ! Barnstars without consensus will be removed . Barnstars are listed in chronological order , that is , in the order in which they were introduced to the English Wikipedia . Please add any new barnstars to the bottom of the appropriate section . General Barnstars are awarded for work or contributions that do not fall into a specific Wikipedia category , but instead that describe contributions or editing along a specific theme . They can be sorted by title by clicking the button next to `` Title and description '' . A topical barnstar is for a topic or area of substantial interest to users of Wikipedia . These barnstars are given to editors for things done behind the scenes , in those corners of the Wikipedia project unseen by the general public , helping to keep things moving along . Editors are free to use variations as appropriate . Best created by subst : the barnstar of your choice then customizing the layout to suit the purpose . This is just a partial list designed to inspire barnstar creativity . Please consider adding your more creative mixtures of barnstars to this list or to Personal user awards . Usage : Pick your barnstar , then go back and change the size to 50 . Usage : See the documentation . Multiple-barnstars are particularly good for WikiProject awards , where the first barnstar is the Project barnstar and the additional ones are for the specific task . They are also useful in conjunction with The Teamwork Barnstar . This is an example of a Barnometer . You can check the coding and then tweak it according to your own needs . Hold your mouse pointer over each barnstar to read each greeting .

Tights are a kind of cloth leg garment , most often sheathing the body from about the waist to the feet with a more or less tight fit , hence the name . Wearing of tights has a long history going back several centuries , when they were worn by men . Today , they are worn primarily by women and girls and some men and boys , as well as infants and toddlers of both sexes . In recent years , they have been sometimes offered as men 's fashion . Athletic tights are already considered unisex . In American English , the difference between pantyhose and tights is determined in the weight of the yarn used and the thickness to which the garment is knitted . Generally , anything up to 40 denier is known as pantyhose and anything over can be classified as tights . In the United Kingdom , the word `` tights '' is used in all cases when referring to pantyhose . There are many sub-classifications of tights\/pantyhose that describe the precise construction ( such as control top , seamless , support ) . Although most tights are mainly nylon or cotton , lycra is normally included in modern blends to improve fit . Unfooted tights are usually called leggings . Athletic tights are often unfooted , although they may have a `` stirrup '' that goes under the foot to hold the cuff down near the ankle . Originally derived from the hose worn by European men several centuries ago , tights were made as close fitting as possible for practical reasons when riding horseback . For men of nobility , the material would be made of silk or fine wool rather than the coarser fabrics used by the lower classes . At the time of King Henry VIII of England , such was the male fashion for displaying a well turned leg that even the king padded the calf area under his hose . Tights are common in the world of theater , especially in Renaissance-era costumes , and dance , particularly in ballet . The term `` tights '' has been used to try to ridicule certain traditional British uniform . Most famously the Serjeant-at-Arms at the Palace of Westminster , after a protester got past the security , were described in the media as `` middle aged men in tights . '' For horseback riding , tights refers to light jodhpurs ( riding pants that extend to the ankle ) that are worn in summer or as an undergarment in winter . These pants , or `` riding tights '' , are cheaper to buy than jodhpurs or breeches ( riding pants that extend to mid calf intended for use with tall riding boots ) . In warm climates they can be worn all year round . Tights can also describe the leg coverings worn in cycling and other athletics , especially by runners and wrestlers . These tights are usually a thicker spandex-blend , and are usually footless . It has also been proven by sport scientists that the use of tights can also reduce muscle strain and other injury . Athletic tights received some publicity during the 2005 â `` 2006 basketball season , when players started wearing the ankle-length tights under their uniform shorts . A prominent NBA player , Kobe Bryant , was one of the first to wear tights , and the style was subsequently adopted by several other NBA players , as well as some college and high school players . The style sparked controversy , leading to proposals to prohibit wearing tights with basketball uniforms . Because the fabric used in tights is made of interwoven fabric such as nylon or cotton , there are pores in the fabric where modern manufacturers have been able to place other items which benefit the skin . They can use microencapsulation techniques to place substances such as moisturizers and other skin creams in the tights . These creams are said to act against the skin to create a health and\/or beauty benefit for the wearer . Some manufacturers have even put caffeine in tights which they claim can reduce cellulite for the wearer .

Meng Tian ( è ' æ ) ( died 210 BCE ) was a general of the Qin Dynasty who distinguished himself in campaigns against the Xiongnu and in the construction of the Great Wall of China . He was the elder brother of Meng Yi . He descended from a great line of military generals and architects . His father Meng Wu was also a Qin general who fought under Wang Jian . By the time the Qin Dynasty conquered the other six states and began its reign over a unified China in 221 B.C. , the nomadic Xiongnu had grown into a powerful invading force in the north and started expanding both east and west . Qin Shi Huang , the first emperor of the Qin Dynasty , sent a 100,000-strong army headed by General Meng Tian to drive the Xiongnu northward for 1,000 li ( about 416 km ) and began work on what has become known as the Great Wall to guard against invasion . The defensive works he began were said to extend over 10,000 li ( 4,158 km ) `` from Lintao to Liaodong and even extended across the Yellow River and through Yangshan and Beijia . '' , that is , from the southwest corner of the Ordos Loop to the Yellow Sea . Yangshan and Beijia are hard to locate , but the wall ran along the Yellow River and included all of the Ordos Loop . Meng Tian 's ingenuity can be seen in the efficient ( though inhumane ) building policy , the consideration of topography , and the utilisation of natural barriers . Meng Tian supervised the construction of a road system linking the former Yan , Qi , Wu and Chu areas , as well as a number of roads especially for imperial use . The system eventually formed played an extremely important role in ancient transportation and economic exchanges . He is also traditionally revered for important improvements of the `` Ink brush '' ( æ ç ) and is specially remembered at the `` Huzhou Pen Festival '' , which developed from festivities at his ancestor temple . When Prince Fusu , Qin Shi Huang 's eldest son and the then-crown prince , was exiled to work at the northern border for disputing his father 's policies , Meng Tian was ordered to assist the prince â '' a task he had accomplished loyally . When the First Emperor died , Meng 's death was brought about through the plotting of Zhao Gao . He was forced to commit suicide in prison , and his family was killed . Three years after his death , the Qin Dynasty collapsed . Meng Tian is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI by Koei . He also appears as a non-playable character in Prince of Qin .

In logic and mathematics , a two-place logical operator or , also known as logical disjunction , inclusive disjunction or alternation , results in true whenever one or more of its operands are true . E.g. in this context , `` A or B '' is true if A is true , or if B is true , or if both A and B are true . In grammar , or is a coordinating conjunction . In ordinary language `` or '' sometimes has the meaning of exclusive disjunction . Or is usually expressed with the prefix operator A , or with an infix operator . In mathematics and logic , the infix operator is usually â ; in electronics , + ; and in programming languages , or or . Some programming languages have a related control structure , the short-circuit or , written , or else , etc. Logical disjunction is an operation on two logical values , typically the values of two propositions , that produces a value of false if and only if both of its operands are false . More generally a disjunction is a logical formula that can have one or more literals separated only by ORs . A single literal is often considered to be a degenerate disjunction . truth-preserving : yes When all inputs are true , the output is true . falsehood-preserving : yes When all inputs are false , the output is false . If using binary values for true ( 1 ) and false ( 0 ) , then logical disjunction works exactly like multiplication modulo 2 . The mathematical symbol for logical disjunction varies in the literature . In addition to the word `` or '' , and the formula `` Apq '' , the symbol '' '' , deriving from the Latin word vel for `` or '' , is commonly used for disjunction . For example : `` A B '' is read as `` A or B '' . Such a disjunction is false if both A and B are false . In all other cases it is true . The corresponding operation in set theory is the set-theoretic union . Operators corresponding to logical disjunction exist in most programming languages . Disjunction is often used for bitwise operations . Examples : The operator can be used to set bits in a bitfield to 1 , by - ing the field with a constant field with the relevant bits set to 1 . Many languages distinguish between bitwise and logical disjunction by providing two distinct operators ; in languages following C , bitwise disjunction is performed with the single pipe and logical disjunction with the double pipe operators . Logical disjunction is usually short-circuited ; that is , if the first ( left ) operand evaluates to then the second ( right ) operand is not evaluated . The logical disjunction operator thus usually constitutes a sequence point . Although in most languages the type of a logical disjunction expression is boolean and thus can only have the value or , in some ( such as Python and JavaScript ) the logical disjunction operator returns one of its operands : the first operand if it evaluates to a true value , and the second operand otherwise . The Curry-Howard correspondence relates a constructivist form of disjunction to tagged union types . The union used in set theory is defined in terms of a logical disjunction : x â A â B if and only if ( x â A ) â ( x â B ) . Because of this , logical disjunction satisfies many of the same identities as set-theoretic union , such as associativity , commutativity , distributivity , and de Morgan 's laws .
Victor Edward Hadfield ( born October 4 , 1940 ) is a retired professional ice hockey player . One of the most popular players in New York Rangers history , Hadfield had a sixteen-year career in the NHL , tallying 323 goals and 389 assists with 1154 penalty minutes in 1002 career games with the Rangers and the Pittsburgh Penguins . Originally signed by the Chicago Black Hawks and assigned to their junior league affiliate St. Catharines Teepees of the Ontario Hockey League , Hadfield established himself as a physical presence , tallying many more penalty minutes than points . With a strong squad in 1960 that included future notable NHL players Chico Maki , Roger Crozier , Pat Stapleton , he averaged a point a game in the regular season and playoffs , but racked up an average of five penalty minutes a game in the playoffs en route to the Teepees ' second Memorial Cup championship . Assigned to Chicago 's Buffalo Bisons farm team in the American Hockey League the following season , he was left unprotected after the 1962 season and claimed by the Rangers in the intra-league draft . By 1964 , Hadfield had cemented a place in the Rangers ' lineup as an enforcer . Gradually , he focused more on scoring than on fighting - especially with feared enforcer Reggie Fleming on the squad - and paired with teammates Jean Ratelle and Rod Gilbert , became known as the famous `` GAG line '' ( which stood for Goal A Game ) . From the 1968 expansion year on and with the resurgence of the long-time doormat Rangers as a strong team , Hadfield would never again score less than 20 goals in any full season . Hadfield 's best year was in 1972 . Named the team 's captain after the trade of longtime captain Bob Nevin , he became the first Ranger - and only the sixth NHL player - to score 50 goals in a season , nearly doubling his previous best marks ; with his linemates Ratelle and Gilbert , the GAG Line totalled 139 goals and 325 points en route to leading the team to the Stanley Cup Finals . Signed to a lucrative contract the following summer seen to deter Hadfield from defecting to the newly created World Hockey Association , he could not maintain his 1972 level of scoring , and was traded after the 1974 season to the Pittsburgh Penguins for defenceman Nick Beverley . He scored thirty goals in each of his two full seasons for the Penguins , although plagued by injuries and weight troubles , but sustained a knee injury towards the end of the 1976 season which forced his retirement . At the time of his retirement , Hadfield was 4th in Rangers ' franchise history in goals , assists and points ( behind his linemates Jean Ratelle and Rod Gilbert , and Andy Bathgate ) , 2nd in penalty minutes ( behind Harry Howell ) and 4th in games played ( behind Ratelle , Howell and Gilbert ) . He currently stands 9th in franchise history in scoring and 3rd in penalty minutes . His younger brother , Carl , was a 1964 draft choice by the Chicago Black Hawks . Hadfield now owns the Vic Hadfield Driving Range and instructional center in Oakville . In 2009 , Hadfield was ranked No. 20 on the all-time list of New York Rangers in the book 100 Ranger Greats ( John Wiley & Sons ) . After his stellar 1972 season , Hadfield was named to Team Canada for the 1972 Summit Series . Controversially , after playing sparingly in just two games , he left the team after the Swedish exhibition games and returned home to Canada , drawing criticism for his move . 1958 â `` 59 St. Catharines Teepees OHA 51 6 1959 â `` 60 St. Catharines Teepees OHA 48 19 34 53 0

The 1950 Formula One season included the inaugural FIA Formula One World Championship season , which commenced on May 13 , 1950 , and ended on September 3 after 7 races . The championship consisted of six Formula One races in Europe plus the Indianapolis 500 , which was run to AAA regulations . Numerous other Formula One races , which did not count towards the Championship , were also held during the year . The inaugural World Championship , to a formula which specified engine capacity of 1.5 litres supercharged or 4.5 litres unsupercharged , saw Alfa Romeo dominate with their supercharged 158 , a well-developed pre-war design , which won all six European Grands Prix . Alfa Romeo drivers consequently dominated the championship with Nino Farina edging out Juan Manuel Fangio by virtue of his fourth place in Belgium . Although the Indianapolis 500 , which ran to different regulations , was included in the championship series until 1960 , it attracted very little European participation and , conversely , very few American Indianapolis drivers entered any grand prix . Championship points were given to top 5 finishers ( 8 , 6 , 4 , 3 , 2 ) . 1 point was given for the fastest lap . Only the best four of seven scores counted towards the World Championship . Points for shared drives were divided equally between the drivers , regardless of how many laps each driver drove . In this first World Championship season , 14 teams ( 4 works and 10 independent ) participated , alongside a number of privately entered cars , in the 6 European Grands Prix . Only US teams , constructors and drivers participated in the Indianapolis 500 . The chassis , engine and car numbers varied from race to race . The following teams and drivers competed in the 1950 FIA Formula One World Championship . Other Formula One races , which did not count towards the World Championship , also held in 1950 .

Arnold Josef RosÃ ( born Rosenblum , 24 October 1863 , IaÅ i -- 25 August 1946 , London ) was a Romanian-born Austrian Jewish violinist . He was leader of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra for over half a century . He worked closely with Brahms . Gustav Mahler was his brother-in-law . Although not known internationally as a soloist he was a great orchestral leader ( concertmaster ) and player of chamber music , leading the famous RosÃ Quartet for several decades . Arnold RosÃ was born in IaÈ i ( Jassy ) in what is now Romania . As he and his three brothers showed musical potential the family moved to Vienna where his father established a thriving business as a carriage builder . Arnold began his musical studies at the age of seven , and at ten entered the first class in violin at the Vienna Conservatory , receiving instruction from Karl Heissler . He made his first appearance in 1879 at a Leipzig Gewandhaus concert , and on 10 April 1881 he appeared with the Vienna Philharmonic Society in the first Viennese performance of Goldmark 's violin concerto under Hans Richter . Shortly thereafter he received an engagement as solo violinist and leader of the orchestra at the Hoftheater or Vienna Court Opera ( later the Staatsoper ) . This orchestra , in unique Viennese tradition , played both in the orchestra pit and on the concert platform , and were the parent of the Vienna Philharmonic orchestra . He remained leader of these two venerable institutions until the 1930s . His reputation as an orchestral leader became legendary . For Sir Adrian Boult he was quite simply â Europeâ s greatest orchestral leader of his timeâ . In 1882 he founded the famous RosÃ Quartet who were regarded as the finest string quartet of their time . From 1893 to 1901 RosÃ taught at the Vienna conservatory ; he rejoined the faculty in 1908 and stayed until 1924 . In 1888 RosÃ made successful tours through Romania and Germany , and in 1889 was appointed concert-master at the Bayreuth Festivals . The story is told that during a performance of Wagnerâ s Die WalkÃ 1\/4 re the orchestra were losing their way . RosÃ stood up and gave a confident lead , bringing the orchestra back together in pitch and tempo . Mahler , who was in the audience , is said to have exclaimed : â Now there IS a concertmaster ! â Both Arnold and his brother Eduard , the cellist , were to marry sisters of Mahler . Gustav Mahler moved from Hamburg to Vienna in 1897 in order to take up the directorate of the Vienna Opera . His sisters Justine and Emma joined him in Vienna a year later . Eduard married Emma that very same month . Justine continued to live with her brother Gustav , keeping house for him . It was not long before a romantic attachment formed between her and Arnold . However , it was kept a secret , Justine being unwilling to marry until her brother had found himself a wife . This happened in 1902 when Gustav married Alma Schindler who was nearly 20 years his junior . She was considered â the most beautiful girl in Viennaâ , and was the daughter of the landscape artist Emil Jakob Schindler . They were married on 9 March 1902 and Arnold and Justine were married the following day . The RosÃ family lived in comfortable circumstances , but life was never to be easy for Jews anywhere in Europe . Emperor Franz Josef had guaranteed â freedom of religion and conscienceâ in 1867 , but the reality was often different . They had two children : Alfred ( 1902-1975 ) , who became a pianist and conductor , and Alma ( 1906-1944 ) who was a very successful violinist , but whose career took a highly tragic turn as she ended up directing an orchestra of prisoners in the concentration camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau . She eventually died in the camp . Justine RosÃ died on 22 August 1938 . Arnold was devastated by her death . Unable to continue living under Nazi occupation , he left Vienna four weeks later and traveled via Holland to England where he spent the last six years of his life . He continued to play chamber music with Buxbaum and other colleagues . His last appearances were in 1945 ; thus his career stretched over 65 years . After he learned the terrible news of Alma 's death at Birkenau , he found it difficult to continue with his work , and died soon afterward . He published editions of the violin sonatas of Bach and Beethoven and of Beethovenâ s Quartets op 18 . In 1890 RosÃ received the Grosse Goldene Verdienstkreuz from King Ludwig II of Bavaria . On the occasion of his 60th birthday he received the honorary title of â Hofratâ ( Court Counsellor ) which was a professional rank above â Professorâ . He received numerous other awards from the Habsburg , Spanish and Italian courts , the republic of Austria , and the city of Vienna . He was a member of the royal musical establishment with the rank of k.u.k. Hofmusiker ( Royal and Imperial Court Musician ) , and as such he had the privilege of a court carriage to carry him to the opera . He also had his own carriage , with fine livery , which took him to concerts at other venues .

Saint-Florent is a commune in Haute-Corse department of France on the island of Corsica . It is a fishing port located on the gulf of the same name . Today , it is a popular summer vacation spot for many tourists because of its proximity to the famous Patrimonio vineyards and one of the most beautiful beaches on the Mediterranean coast , Saleccia . Saint-Florent was created by the Genoese in the 16th century as a base to carry out repressive operations against the Corsican patriots in the surrounding villages . France later used it to disembark hordes of mercenaries and colonists during August 1764 in order to subject the independent Corsican people . After the defeat at Ponte Novu Bridge , the army of Pasquale Paoli , sometimes called `` the father of Corsica '' , helped by the fleet of Horatio Nelson , reconquered Saint-Florent in 1794 during the brief Anglo-Corsican rule . Saint-Florent has a typically Mediterranean climate - mild winters with temperatures rarely dropping below zero give way to long , warm , dry summers with temperatures peaking at around 35 Â C in July and August . The monuments of Saint-Florent are the Genoese citadel constructed in 1440 at the same time as the city , and the Romanesque Saint-Florent Cathedral , or the cathedral of the Nebbio , now the church of Santa Maria Assunta . Near the village are the Genoese towers Torra di Mortella and Torra di Fornali .
MÃ rcio Amoroso dos Santos ( born 5 July 1974 in BrasÃ lia ) is a Brazilian footballer . He has played his football for several teams in Japan , Italy , Germany , Spain and Greece while representing Brazil at international level . Unreferenced reports suggested that Amoroso signed for a minor Bulgarian club on 30 June 2010 . Amoroso started his career at homeland club Guarani FC at 1992 . In July 1992 , he was loaned to a Japanese outfit Verdy Kawasaki ( J. League ) , and returned to Guarani FC two years later . In 1996 , he transferred to Flamengo , but he came to prominence playing in the Italian Serie A for unfashionable Udinese Calcio in the late-1990s . There he starred alongside Oliver Bierhoff in a side which played an adventurous 3 â `` 4 â `` 3 formation . When Oliver Bierhoff left the club for AC Milan , many thought Udinese Calcio would struggle to repeat their success , but that very next season Amoroso himself became the focus of the team , and was the top scorer in Serie A. A big-money move to Parma followed . The AC Parma side never quite fulfilled their potential to win the league title , and Amoroso was soon on the move again , this time to Borussia Dortmund in Germany where he won the Bundesliga title in 2001 â `` 02 and was the top scorer in the season . He helped them to the 2002 UEFA Cup Final where his goal ( a penalty ) could not prevent them going 3 â `` 2 down to Feyenoord Rotterdam . Amoroso played for MÃ laga CF during the 2004 â `` 05 season . Amoroso moved to SÃ # o Paulo FC in the summer of 2005 and immediately helped them to the Copa Libertadores , the most prestigious club prize in South America . In January 2006 , after having won the FIFA Club World Championship and was the top scorers in tournament , he returned to Italy , signing a 18-month contract for AC Milan as a replacement for Christian Vieri , who had transferred to AS Monaco . But then Amoroso agreed to cancel the contract with AC Milan on 1 September 2006 , and immediately signed a new contract with Corinthians . Amoroso quickly received the no. 10 jersey from Corinthians as a replacement for Carlos TÃ vez ( who left SC Corinthians Paulista and moved to West Ham United ) . But there he could not show the football that he was capable of , having his contract resigned in April 2007 , signing in for GrÃ mio . Since August , Amoroso does not play for GrÃ mio , having his contract resigned due to lack of form . In January 2008 he signed a one-and-a-half year contract with Aris Thessaloniki . However , he played for only half a year for Aris Thessaloniki . On 29 December 2008 , Amoroso returned to Guarani FC for the 2008-2009 season . Aris Thessaloniki will be Amorosoâ s 12th club in six different countries . He has won 20 trophies and personal awards , including the Copa AmÃ rica with Brazil and both the FIFA Club World Championship and Copa Libertadores with SÃ # o Paulo . He has also played for Verdy Kawasaki , Flamengo , Udinese , Parma , Borussia Dortmund , MÃ laga , Milan , Corinthians , GrÃ mio and Guarani which was his last club . Amoroso has been the top scorers in three different national championships and Bundesliga record transfer when he moved to Borussia Dortmund for 50 million mark ( 25 million euro ) in the summer of 2001 . Parma had actually paid 2 million euro more to sign him two years earlier .
The British Rail Class 444 Desiro electrical multiple units were built in Germany by Siemens AG from 2003-04 . Forty-five of these units were built for express services for South West Trains . The Siemens `` Desiro UK '' family also includes units of Classes 185 , 350 , 360 , 380 , and 450 . At the dawn of the 21st century , as part of its franchise agreement , South West Trains ( SWT ) was required to order new trains to replace the old slam-door stock of Classes 411 , 412 , 421 and 423 . Therefore , in April 2001 , an order was placed with Siemens AG for 785 vehicles . This order was originally to be split as 100 four-car Class 450\/0 outer-suburban units , 32 five-car Class 450\/2 inner-suburban units and 45 five-car Class 444 express units . The Class 444 fleet was built by Siemens at its Vienna plant in Austria . Before shipping to Britain via the Channel Tunnel , units were extensively tested at the test-track at Wildenrath . This extensive testing procedure was performed as in attempt to reduce the time taken for new trains to enter service , by ironing out any problems beforehand . Many other designs of new train , such as the Bombardier Class 375 and Alstom Class 458 units , had been plagued by problems and poor reliability . The Desiro fleet entered service faster than its competitors , but the trains still suffered from teething problems . Units are formed of five cars or coaches , and are numbered in the range 444001-045 . Each unit is formed of two outer driving motors , two intermediate trailers , and an intermediate buffet coach . The description of this formation is DMSO+TSO+TSO+TSRMB+DMCO . Individual vehicles are numbered as follows . Units have end-gangways , which allows people to move between units when they are used in multiple on services . Trains are limited to a 10-coach length ( i.e. two units ) as longer trains can not be accommodated in stations . The fleet is painted in SWT 's express livery of white , with a blue window band , and red\/orange swishes at the cab ends . Each five car unit has a first class section taking up just over half of one car at one end ; first class seats have BS 1363 sockets providing AC power suitable for laptops or mobile phone charges , while the car at the other end is standard class throughout and appears ordinary but has BS1363 sockets under the tables . Like all new build third rail stock in the UK , one coach in each unit is fitted with a recess for a pantograph . This allows for a future conversion to AC overhead power . Class 444 trains have been awarded with the `` Golden Spanner 2010 '' as Great Britain 's most reliable trains by the Modern Railways journal . During twelve months , the vehicle feet operated by SWT has set a new reliability record of almost 89,000 kilometres per technical delay . The first Class 444 units entered service with SWT in early 2004 . As part of their launch into traffic , unit no. 444018 was named `` The Fab 444 '' at a ceremony at London Waterloo . The units were introduced on services from London Waterloo to Portsmouth Harbour via the Portsmouth Direct Line . Units were also used on some services on the South Western Main Line to Southampton Central , and . This allowed the withdrawal of the final 4Cep units by mid-2004 , and inroads were made to the 4Bep , 4Cig and 4Vep fleets . It was originally hoped that the final slam-door units would be withdrawn by 31 December 2004 . However , some were allowed to remain operational until May 2005 as the last replacement Desiros came into service . Initially , the Class 444 units were primarily used on the Portsmouth direct services , allowing the Wessex Electric units to be used on the Weymouth line . The Class 444 units were also used regularly on Sunday-only Bournemouth stopping services , Waterloo to Southampton services and the Brockenhurst to Wareham shuttle service . Previous power limitations on the line west of Poole meant that units were not permitted to run west of the town ; the power limitations have since been lifted . During 2007 , the Class 444 units replaced the Wessex Electrics on the Weymouth line . Some 442 diagrams were taken over by 444s as early as November 2006 with the final 442 being withdrawn from passenger service in February 2007 . Class 444s transferred to the Weymouth line were replaced on Portsmouth services by Class 450 Desiros which became available after the reintroduction of the Class 458 units on the Waterloo to Reading line . The decision to transfer many 444 units to the Weymouth line was not a popular one . Portsmouth line passengers protested over the use of class 450s on some services while there were complaints that the 444s were inferior to the units they replaced on the Weymouth line . In June 2007 , it was reported in the Ipswich Evening Star that the Network Rail 's Greater Anglia area Rail Utilisation Strategy was ` touting ' the possibility of introducing a train based on the class 444 on the London - Ipswich - Norwich railway line .

Capcom Co. , Ltd. is an Osaka-based Japanese developer and publisher of video games , known for creating multi-million-selling franchises such as Resident Evil , Street Fighter , and Mega Man . Originally established in 1983 , it has since become an international enterprise with branches and subsidiaries in North America , Europe , and East Asia . The original companies that spawned Capcom 's Japanese branch were I.R.M Corporation founded on May 30 , 1979 , as well as its subsidiary Japan Capsule Computer Co. , Ltd. , both of which were devoted to the manufacturing and distribution of electronic game machines . The two companies underwent a name change to Sambi Co. , Ltd. in September 1981 , while Capcom Co. , Ltd. itself was first established on June 11 , 1983 , for the purpose of taking over the internal sales department . In January 1989 , the old affiliate company of the same name merged with Sambi Co. , Ltd. , resulting in the current Japanese branch . The name Capcom is an abbreviation of `` Capsule Computer '' , a term coined by the company to describe the arcade machines it solely manufactured in its early years , designed to set themselves apart from personal computers that were becoming widespread at that time . The word capsule alludes to how Capcom likened its game software to `` a capsule packed to the brim with gaming fun '' , as well as to the company 's desire to protect its intellectual property with a hard outer shell , preventing illegal copies and inferior imitations . While Capcom 's first product was the coin-operated Little League from July 1983 , its first real video game , the arcade title Vulgus , was released in May 1984 . Beginning with a Nintendo Entertainment System port of 1942 published in December 1985 , the company started to venture into the market of home console video games , which became its main business segment a few years later . Since then , Capcom created 15 multi-million-selling game series , the most successful of which is Resident Evil . In addition to the development and publishing of home , online , mobile , arcade , pachinko , and pachislo games , the company publishes strategy guides , maintains its own arcade centers , and licenses its franchise and character properties for use in tie-in products , movies , television series , and stage performances . Suleputer , an in-house marketing and music label established in cooperation with Sony Music Entertainment Intermedia in 1998 , publishes CDs , DVDs , and other media based on Capcom 's games . An annual private media summit called Captivate , renamed from Gamers Day in 2008 , is traditionally used as a platform for new game and business announcements . In the first few years after its establishment , Capcom Co. , Ltd. had three development groups referred to as `` Planning Rooms '' , led by Tokuro Fujiwara , Takashi Nishiyama and Yoshiki Okamoto , respectively . Later , games developed internally used to be created by several numbered `` Production Studios '' , each assigned to different games . Since 2002 , the development process has been reformed to better share technologies and expertise , and all of the individual studios have been gradually restructured into bigger departments responsible for different tasks . While there are self-contained departments for the creation of arcade , pachinko and pachislo , online , and mobile games , the Consumer Games R&D Division instead is an amalgamation of subsections in charge of various game development stages . In addition to these internal teams , Capcom also commissions outside development studios to ensure a steady output of titles . However , following bad sales of Dark Void and Bionic Commando , the company 's management has decided to limit outsourcing to sequels and newer versions of installments in existing franchises , reserving the development of original titles for its in-house teams . The production of games , budgets , and platforms supported are decided upon in development approval meetings , attended by the company management and the Marketing , Sales , and Quality Control Departments . Apart from the head office and R&D building of Capcom Co. , Ltd. located in Osaka , the Japanese parent company also has branch offices in Tokyo and Iga . The international Capcom Group currently encompasses 15 subsidiaries in Japan , North America , Europe , and East Asia . Affiliated companies include Koko Capcom Co. , Ltd. in South Korea , Street Fighter Film , LLC in the United States , and Dellgamadas Co. , Ltd.

Dayton is a city in Campbell County , Kentucky , United States , along a bend of the Ohio River . The population was 5,966 at the 2000 census . It is less than 2 m from downtown Cincinnati , Ohio . Dayton is located at ( 39.111781 , -84.470401 ) . According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 1.7 square miles ( 4.3 & kmÂ ) , of which , 1.3 square miles ( 3.4 kmÂ ) of it is land and 0.3 square miles ( 0.9 kmÂ ) of it ( 20.48 % ) is water . Dayton is located within Kentucky 's Outer Bluegrass region in the Upper South of the United States of America . Dayton had a ferry crossing , established in this area by the early 19th century , at the foot of what 's now Dayton Street . Two communities , Jamestown and Brooklyn , laid out in 1848 , merged in 1867 and were renamed Dayton in honor of Dayton , Ohio . Jamestown was incorporated March 1 , 1848 . According to the state charter , the founding fathers were James Berry , James McArthur & Henry Walker . Berry was a nephew of James Taylor Jr. , founder of Newport , Kentucky . Dayton has a large sandbar , just off its shore . It had a popular beach for many years known as the `` Manhattan Bathing Beach '' , until the US Army Corps of Engineers raised the level of the Ohio River . Laws were passed prohibiting nude swimming in the Ohio River during daylight hours , and prohibiting dogs from running loose . Violators of the nude swimming law faced a penalty of a $ 1.00 fine for the first offense , and could go as high as $ 5.00 for subsequent offenses . People also had the right to shoot dogs that were running loose in the city , and bill the owners for carcass removal . Floods in 1884 , 1913 and 1937 ( see 1937 flood ) - the latter affecting 80 percent of the city and prompting residents to take shelter in the garages of the former Wadsworth Watch Case Co. - caused many of the companies in the once-booming town to move elsewhere . By the 1950s , many residents , weary of constant flooding , moved out of the town as well . Many think Dayton 's salvation came with the completion of a floodwall in late 1981 . Today Dayton is working on downtown revitalization and a historical survey of the city , it is the first step toward creating a historic district in the city . In the 2008 presidential election , Barack Obama carried the city of Dayton . As of the census of 2000 , there were 5,966 people , 2,200 households , and 1,518 families residing in the city . The population density was 4,494.7 people per square mile ( 1,731.9 \/ kmÂ ) . There were 2,401 housing units at an average density of 1,808.9 \/ sq mi ( 697.0 \/ kmÂ ) . The racial makeup of the city was 98.32 % White , 0.45 % African American , 0.18 % Native American , 0.17 % Asian , 0.02 % Pacific Islander , 0.08 % from other races , and 0.77 % from two or more races . Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.59 % of the population . There were 2,200 households out of which 35.2 % had children under the age of 18 living with them , 45.3 % were married couples living together , 18.0 % had a female householder with no husband present , and 31.0 % were non-families . 25.5 % of all households were made up of individuals and 10.6 % had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older . The average household size was 2.69 and the average family size was 3.24 . In the city the population was spread out with 28.2 % under the age of 18 , 11.9 % from 18 to 24 , 29.8 % from 25 to 44 , 19.5 % from 45 to 64 , and 10.6 % who were 65 years of age or older . The median age was 32 years . For every 100 females there were 96.1 males . For every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 92.0 males . The median income for a household in the city was $ 32,008 , and the median income for a family was $ 38,339 . Males had a median income of $ 28,592 versus $ 21,048 for females . The per capita income for the city was $ 15,373 . About 15.2 % of families and 16.3 % of the population were below the poverty line , including 24.4 % of those under age 18 and 4.7 % of those age 65 or over .
A tadpole or polliwog ( also pollywog or porwigle ) is the wholly aquatic larval stage in the life cycle of an amphibian , particularly that of a frog or toad . The name `` tadpole '' is from Middle English taddepol , made up of the elements tadde , `` toad '' , and pol , `` head '' ( modern English `` poll '' ) . Similarly , `` polliwog '' is from Middle English polwygle , made up of the same pol , `` head '' and wiglen , `` to wiggle '' . Tadpoles are young amphibians that live in the water . During the tadpole stage of the amphibian life cycle , most respire by means of autonomous external or internal gills . They do not usually have arms or legs until the transition to adulthood , and typically have dorsal or fin-like appendages and a tail with which they swim by lateral undulation , similar to most fish . As a tadpole matures , it most commonly metamorphosizes by gradually growing limbs ( usually the legs first , followed by the arms ) and then ( most commonly in the case of frogs ) outwardly absorbing its tail by apoptosis . Lungs develop around the time of leg development , and tadpoles late in development will often be found near the surface of the water , where they breathe air . During the final stages of external metamorphosis , the tadpole 's mouth changes from a small , enclosed mouth at the front of the head to a large mouth the same width as the head . The intestines shorten to make way for the new diet . Most tadpoles are herbivorous , subsisting on algae and plants . Some species are omnivorous , eating detritus and , when available , smaller tadpoles . Remarkably , despite their soft-bodied nature and lack of mineralised hard parts , fossil tadpoles ( around 10 cm in length ) have been recovered from Upper Miocene strata . They are preserved by virtue of biofilms , with more robust structures ( the jaw & bones ) preserved as a carbon film . In Miocene fossils from Libros , Spain , the brain case is preserved in calcium carbonate , and the nerve cord in calcium phosphate . Other parts of the tadpoles ' bodies exist as organic remains and bacterial biofilms , with sedimentary detritus present in the gut . Tadpole remains with telltale external gills are also known from several of the Labyrinthodont groups .
Newspeak is a fictional language in George Orwell 's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four . In it , it refers to the deliberately impoverished language promoted by state . The term was also used to discuss Soviet phraseology . Orwell included an essay about it in the form of an appendix in which the basic principles of the language are explained . Newspeak is closely based on English but has a greatly reduced and simplified vocabulary and grammar . This suits the totalitarian regime of the Party , whose aim is to make any alternative thinkingâ '' `` thoughtcrime '' , or `` crimethink '' in the newest edition of Newspeakâ '' impossible by removing any words or possible constructs which describe the ideas of freedom , rebellion and so on . One character , Syme , says admiringly of the shrinking volume of the new dictionary : `` It 's a beautiful thing , the destruction of words . '' The Newspeak term for the English language is Oldspeak . Oldspeak is intended to have been completely supplanted by Newspeak before 2050 . The genesis of Newspeak can be found in the constructed language Basic English , which Orwell promoted from 1942 to 1944 before emphatically rejecting it in his essay `` Politics and the English Language '' . In this paper he laments the quality of the English of his day , citing examples of dying metaphors , pretentious diction or rhetoric , and meaningless words - all of which contribute to fuzzy ideas and a lack of logical thinking . Towards the end of this essay , having argued his case , Orwell muses : The basic idea behind Newspeak is to remove all shades of meaning from language , leaving simple dichotomies ( pleasure and pain , happiness and sadness , goodthink and crimethink ) which reinforce the total dominance of the State . Similarly , Newspeak root words served as both nouns and verbs , which allowed further reduction in the total number of words ; for example , `` think '' served as both noun and verb , so the word thought was not required and could be abolished . A staccato rhythm of short syllables was also a goal , further reducing the need for deep thinking about language . ( See duckspeak . ) Successful Newspeak meant that there would be fewer and fewer words - dictionaries would get thinner and thinner . In addition , words with negative meanings were removed as redundant , so `` bad '' became `` ungood '' . Words with comparative and superlative meanings were also simplified , so `` better '' became `` gooder '' , and `` best '' likewise became `` goodest '' . Intensifiers could be added , so `` great '' became `` plusgood '' , and `` excellent '' and `` splendid '' likewise became `` doubleplusgood '' . Adjectives were formed by adding the suffix '' - ful '' to a root word ( e.g. , `` goodthinkful '' , orthodox in thought ) , and adverbs by adding '' - wise '' ( `` goodthinkwise '' , in an orthodox manner ) . In this manner , as many words as possible were removed from the language . The ultimate aim of Newspeak was to reduce even the dichotomies to a single word that was a `` yes '' of some sort : an obedient word with which everyone answered affirmatively to what was asked of them . Some of the constructions in Newspeak , such as `` ungood '' , are in fact characteristic of agglutinative languages , although foreign to English . It is possible that Orwell modeled aspects of Newspeak on Esperanto ; for example `` ungood '' is constructed similarly to the Esperanto word malbona . Orwell had been exposed to Esperanto in 1927 when living in Paris with his aunt Ellen Kate Limouzin and her husband EugÃ ne Lanti , a prominent Esperantist . Esperanto was the language of the house , and Orwell was disadvantaged by not speaking it , which may account for some antipathy towards the language . Some examples of Newspeak from the novel include crimethink , doublethink , and Ingsoc . They mean , respectively , `` thoughtcrime '' , `` accepting as correct two mutually contradictory beliefs '' , and `` English socialism '' ( the official political philosophy of the Party ) . The word Newspeak itself also comes from the language . All of these words would be obsolete and should be removed in the `` final '' version of Newspeak , except for doubleplusungood in certain contexts . Generically , Newspeak has come to mean any attempt to restrict disapproved language by a government or other powerful entity . The `` A '' group of words are for simple concepts , such as `` eating '' and `` drinking '' . Groups of words such as the `` B '' group convey more complicated topics . The only way to say `` bad '' is with ungood . Something awful or extremely terrible is called `` doubleplusungood '' . The `` C '' group is for very technical vocabulary . Since the Party does not want people to be intelligent in multiple fields , there is no word for `` science '' . There are separate words for different fields .
OnryÅ ( æ é ) is a mythological spirit from Japanese folklore who is able to return to the physical world in order to seek vengeance . While male onryÅ can be found , mainly in kabuki , the majority are women . Powerless in the physical world , they often suffer at the capricious whims of their male lovers . In death they become strong . The traditional Japanese spirit world is layered , with Yomi on one extreme , and the physical world on the other . In-between is a sort of purgatory , an uncertain and ambiguous waiting area where spirits languish before moving on . Ghosts in this in-between state who are very powerful from love , jealousy , hatred or sorrow can bridge the gap back to the physical plane where they can haunt and wreak havoc on their earthly tormentors . While driven by their desire for vengeance , they rarely follow the Western ideals of justified revenge . For example , several tales involve abusive husbands , but these husbands are rarely the target of the onryÅ 's vengeance . Possibly the most famous onryÅ is Oiwa , from Yotsuya Kaidan . In this story the husband remains unharmed ; however , he is the target of the onryÅ â s vengeance . Oiwa 's vengeance on him is n't physical retribution , but rather psychological torment . Traditionally , onryÅ and other yÅ `` rei had no particular appearance . However , with the rising of popularity of Kabuki during the Edo period , a specific costume was developed . Highly visual in nature , and with a single actor often assuming various roles within a play , Kabuki developed several visual shorthands that allowed the audience to instantly clue in as to which character is on stage , as well as emphasize the emotions and expressions of the actor .

When postal officials rejected that designation , the name was changed to Mitchell , honoring another railroad company officer . That name was also rejected because another town of that name existed elsewhere in the territory . Railroad officials then chose the name Idabel , a compound of the names of Isaac Purnell 's two daughters , Ida and Bell . In 1980 , Idabel was the subject of a race riot when a large group of blacks became upset at the handling of the murder of Henry Lee Johnson , a 15 year old black male .

Second base , or 2B , is the second of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a base runner in order to score a run for that player 's team . A second baseman is the baseball player guarding second base . Also called second bagger , the second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet , needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly , and must be able to make the pivot on a double play . In addition , second basemen are usually right-handed ; only five left-handed throwing players have ever played second base since 1957 . Second base is also known as the keystone sack . In the numbering system used to record defensive plays , the second baseman is assigned the number 4 . Good second basemen need to have very good range , since they have to field balls closer to the first baseman who is often holding runners on , or moving towards the base to cover . On a batted ball to right field , the second baseman goes out towards the ball for the relay . Due to these requirements , second base is sometimes a primarily defensive position in the modern game , but there are hitting stars as well .
Rubidium nitrate is a stable rubidium salt of nitric acid , which has a chemical formula of RbNO3 . Rubidium nitrate is an oxidant and should be kept away from combustible material . Rubidium nitrate is a white crystalline powder that is highly soluble in water and very slightly soluble in acetone . When a flame test is performed , RbNO3 gives a mauve\/light purple color . Like caesium nitrate , it is used in infrared radiation producing pyrotechnic compositions as a colorant and an oxidizer , e.g. in decoys and illumination flares . It is also used as a raw material for preparation of other rubidium compounds and rubidium metal , for manufacture of catalysts and in scintillation counters . It finds uncommon use in fireworks to produce a red-violet color .
Russian Far East is a term that refers to the Russian part of the Far East , i.e. , extreme east parts of Russia , between Lake Baikal in Eastern Siberia and the Pacific Ocean . The Russian Far Eastern Federal District , which covers this area , should not be confused with the Siberian Federal District , which does not stretch all the way to the Pacific . In Russia , the region is usually referred to as just `` Far East '' , creating potential confusion with the international meaning of Far East in translation . The latter is usually referred to in Russia as `` the Asia-Pacific Region '' ( , abbreviated to ) , or `` East Asia '' . Russia reached the Pacific coast in 1647 with the establishment of Okhotsk , and consolidated its control over the Russian Far East in the 19th century . Until 2000 , the Russian Far East lacked officially defined boundaries . A single term `` Siberia and the Far East '' was often used to refer to Russia 's regions east of the Urals without drawing a clear distinction between `` Siberia '' and `` the Far East . '' Several entities with the name `` Far East '' had existed in the first half of the 20th century , all with rather different boundaries : From 1938 to 2000 , there was no official entity with this name and the term `` Far East '' was used loosely , much like `` the West '' in the United States . In 2000 , Russia 's federal subjects were grouped into larger federal districts , and Far Eastern Federal District was created , comprising Amur Oblast , Chukotka Autonomous Okrug , Jewish Autonomous Oblast , Kamchatka Oblast , Koryak Autonomous Okrug , Khabarovsk Krai , Magadan Oblast , Primorsky Krai , Sakha ( Yakutia ) Republic , and Sakhalin Oblast . Since 2000 , the term `` Far East '' has been increasingly used in Russia to refer to the district , though it is often also used more loosely . Defined by the boundaries of the federal district , the Far East has an area of 6.2 million square kilometersâ '' over one-third of the Russia 's total area . According to the 2002 Census , Far Eastern Federal District had a population of 6,692,865 . Most of it is concentrated in the southern parts . Given the vast territory of the Russian Far East , 6.7 million people translates to slightly more than one person per square kilometer , making the Russian Far East one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world . The population of the Russian Far East has been rapidly declining since the dissolution of the Soviet Union ( even more so than for Russia in general ) , dropping by 14 % in the last fifteen years . The Russian government has been discussing a range of re-population programs to avoid the forecast drop to 4.5 million people by 2015 , hoping to attract in particular the remaining Russian population of the near abroad . Ethnic Russians and Ukrainians make up the majority of the population . 75 % of the population is urban . The largest cities are ( all population figures are as of the 2002 Census ) :
`` Ur So Gay '' is the debut promotional single released by pop singer Katy Perry , produced by Greg Wells and engineered by Drew Pearson . The song was Perry 's first major label release , and was later placed on her major label album , One of the Boys . The song was released digitally as well as a 12 '' EP . Capitol Records offered this song as a free download on her website . The single cover has a parental advisory sticker on it . When asked about her debut single , Perry said the song was a `` soft hello '' . The song `` was n't meant to be a big single or show what the album is going to be all about . That was for my Internet bloggers , so I 'm not coming out of nowhere . '' Perry 's A&R Chris Anokute confirmed this by saying that they had no plans for radio coverage but just wanted to put this `` novelty '' song out online as an introduction to see `` what the attraction was '' . As expected sales were low , but Anokute said the EP did well in terms of building a press story . For the release of the single , Perry 's label told her to include a cover . She originally wanted to cover a Queen song , but could n't think of a particularly club-worthy song . While at a club with her friends , The Outfield 's `` Your Love '' was played . Perry said that when the song came on , every girl in the place went onto the dance floor , and she wanted to have that same effect . The song 's lyrics have been described in a positive review as `` eighteen different kinds of wrong . '' The song itself has been described as an `` emo-bashing anthem that 's either horribly homophobic , a sly piece of social commentary or , possibly , both . '' The St. Petersburg Times writes that the `` boyfriend-skewering ... is n't homophobic , but it does pummel straight guys who ca n't handle her edge . '' Some critics , however , conclude the song is homophobic . Ugo.com says the song settles for `` catchphrase-homophobia '' while Allmusic describes the lyrics as `` gay-baiting '' . The video was directed by Walter May . In the video , Perry plays the song in front of a bright cartoon-like background with clouds that have smiley faces on them . The characters in the video are played by Fashion Royalty dolls .

Urby Vitorrio Diego Emanuelson ( born 16 June 1986 in Amsterdam ) is a Dutch footballer of Surinamese descent , who currently plays for Serie A club Milan . He plays as either a left midfielder or left back . Despite playing as a defender , he is best known for attacking attributes such as pace and dribbling . Emanuelson is a product of Ajax 's youth system , joining them from Voorland SC . He made his debut during the 2004 â `` 05 season on April 10 , 2005 in a 4 â `` 2 home win over AZ . As of the 2005 â `` 06 season he became first-choice left back and he won his first career trophies , starting with the 2005 Johan Cruijff-schaal and the 2006 KNVB Cup . During the transfer period in the summer of 2007 , Ajax issued a do-not-touch label on Emanuelson as a warning to other clubs who planned to make a bid for the young talent . When Marco van Basten took over as club coach in 2008 â `` 09 , Emanuelson began on the left back position . But later , after numerous of disappointing matches and bad defending , Emanuelson was placed as left midfielder or left winger , letting him focus more on attacking play than defensive . On 30 November 2008 , Emanuelson played his 150th match for the club . Now , Emanuelson primarily plays as a left midfielder because of his weak defending abilities .

A regatta is a series of boat races . The term typically describes racing events of rowed or sailed water craft , although some powerboat race series are also called regattas . A regatta often includes social and promotional activities which surround the racing event , and except in the case of boat type ( or `` class '' ) championships , is usually named for the town or venue where the event takes place . Although regattas are typically amateur competitions , they are usually formally structured events , with comprehensive rules describing the schedule and procedures of the event . Regattas may be organized as championships for a particular area or type of boat , but are often held just for the joy of competition , camaraderie , and general promotion of the sport . Sailing race events are either held for either for a single class , a single model of boat such as the Islander 36 and usually last more than one day . Regattas may be hosted by a yacht club , sailing association , town or school as in the case of the UK 's National School Sailing Association and Interscholastic Sailing Association ( high school ) regattas or Intercollegiate Sailing Association ( college ) regattas . One of the largest and most popular rowing regattas is the Henley Royal Regatta held on the River Thames , England . One of the largest and oldest yachting regattas in the world is Cowes Week , which is held annually by the Royal Yacht Squadron in Cowes , England usually attracts over 900 sailboats . Cowes Week is predated by the Cumberland Cup ( 1775 ) , Port of Dartmouth Royal Regatta ( 1822 ) and Port of Plymouth Regatta ( 1823 ) . North America 's oldest regatta is the Royal St. John 's Regatta held on Quidi Vidi Lake in St. John 's , Newfoundland every year since 1826 . The etymology of the word `` regatta '' is debated : some maintain it is derived from the Italian `` riga '' , line , for the starting line ; some say it comes from the Latin `` aurigare '' which means to race ; others consider it derived from the Latin `` remus '' , oar .
The Sydney funnel-web spider Atrax robustus , is an Australian funnel-web spider usually found within a 100 km ( 62 mi ) radius of Sydney , New South Wales , Australia . Sydney funnel-webs are medium-to-large in size , with a body length ranging from 2 cm to 7 cm ( 0.9 '' to 3 '' ) . They are glossy and darkly colored , ranging from blue-black to black to brown or dark-plum colored . The carapace covering the cephalothorax is almost hairless and so appears smooth and glossy . The shorter lived males are smaller than females but longer legged . It is one of three species of the genus Atrax in the family Hexathelidae . The common name of the species is shared by other members of the genus Hadronyche , but it and the northern tree funnel-web are the only Australian funnel-web spiders known to have inflicted fatal bites to humans . The spider can be very aggressive when provoked . The long-lived female funnel-webs spend most of the time in their silk-lined tubular burrow retreats . Males , recognized by the modified terminal segment of the palp , tend to wander during the warmer months of the year looking for receptive females to mate with . They are attracted to water and hence are often found in swimming pools , into which they often fall while wandering . The spiders can survive such immersion for up to twenty-four hours and can deliver bites when removed from the water . They are mostly terrestrial spiders , favoring habitat with moist sand and clays . They typically build silk-lined tubular burrow retreats with collapsed `` tunnels '' or open `` funnel '' entrances from which irregular trip lines radiate out over the ground . In some exceptions , which lack trip lines but may have trapdoors , the silk entrance tube may be split into two openings , in a Y or T form . The burrow may be in the hollow of a tree trunk or limb , many metres above ground level . Distribution is primarily South of the Hunter River to the Illawarra region , and west to the Blue Mountains in New South Wales . However , unconfirmed reports contradicting Gray ( 1987 ) claim that the Sydney funnel-web spider has been found as far away as Canberra , 250 km from Sydney , and even Gloucestershire in England . Funnel-web spider venom contains a compound known as atracotoxin , a highly toxic ion channel inhibitor . These spiders typically deliver a full envenomation when they bite , often striking repeatedly , due to their aggression and large chitinous cheliceral fangs . For this reason , people are strongly advised not to approach them . Chances of being bitten are high if encountered . There is at least one recorded case of a small child dying within 15 minutes of a bite from a Sydney funnel-web spider ; that event occurred before the development of an antivenom . For very small children the amount of venom dispersed throughout the body is many times the concentration in an adult . Since the antivenom was developed in 1980 , there have been no recorded fatalities due to this species .

Christian hedonism is a Christian doctrine current in some evangelical circles , particularly those of the Reformed tradition . The term was coined by Reformed Baptist pastor John Piper in his 1986 book Desiring God . Piper summarizes this philosophy of the Christian life as `` God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him . '' Christian Hedonism may anachronistically describe the theology of Jonathan Edwards . The Westminster Shorter Catechism summarizes the `` chief end of man '' as `` to glorify God and enjoy Him forever . '' Piper has suggested that this would be more correct as `` to glorify God by enjoying Him forever . '' Many Christian hedonists point to figures such as Blaise Pascal and Jonathan Edwards as exemplars of Christian hedonism from the past , before the term was current . Jeremy Taylor once said that `` God threatens terrible things if we will not be happy . '' Christian hedonism was developed in opposition to the deontology of Immanuel Kant and the Objectivism of Ayn Rand . Piper himself supported Rand 's attack on Kantian altruism : An action is moral , said Kant , only if one has no desire to perform it , but performs it out of a sense of duty and derives no benefit from it of any sort , neither material nor spiritual . A benefit destroys the moral value of an action . ( Thus if one has no desire to be good , one can not be good ; if one has , one can . ) British writer C. S. Lewis , in an oft-quoted passage in his short piece `` The Weight of Glory , '' likewise objects to Kantian ethics : If there lurks in most modern minds the notion that to desire our own good and to earnestly hope for the enjoyment of it is a bad thing , I suggest that this notion has crept in from Kant and the Stoics and is no part of the Christian faith . Indeed , if we consider the unblushing promises of reward and the staggering nature of the rewards promised in the Gospels , it would seem that our Lord finds our desires , not too strong , but too weak . We are half-hearted creatures , fooling around with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us , like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he can not imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea . We are far too easily pleased . But not only is disinterested morality ( doing good `` for its own sake '' ) impossible ; it is undesirable . That is , it is unbiblical ; because it would mean that the better a man became the harder it would be for him to act morally . The closer he came to true goodness the more naturally and happily he would do what is good . A good man in Scripture is not the man who dislikes doing good but toughs it out for the sake of duty . A good man loves kindness ( Micah 6:8 ) and delights in the law of the Lord ( Psalm 1:2 ) , and the will of the Lord ( Psalm 40:8 ) . But how shall such a man do an act of kindness disinterestedly ? The better the man , the more joy in obedience . Some evangelical Christians object to Christian hedonism 's controversial name . It has little historic commonality with philosophical hedonism , however ; Piper has stated that a provocative term is `` appropriate for a philosophy that has a life changing effect on its adherents . '' Critics charge that hedonism of any sort puts something ( namely , pleasure ) before God , which allegedly breaks the first of the Ten Commandments : `` You shall have no other gods before me . '' In response , Piper states in Desiring God that `` By Christian Hedonism , we do not mean that our happiness is the highest good . '' Other evangelical Christians reject the doctrine because of a possible misinterpretation of Christian hedonism 's premise . To say `` God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him '' suggests that God is somehow reliant on the satisfaction of human beings for His objective glorification . It is apparent however that this can not be the case because this is not concerning objective glorification but rather God 's glorification in the lives of individuals . Evangelical theologians since the Reformation have consistently taught that God 's infinite glory is a personal attribute of God , distinct and independent of the existence of any other beings , and therefore not subject to human feelings for its definition or degree .
A group of taxa is said to be paraphyletic if the group consists of all the descendants of a possibly hypothetical closest common ancestor minus one or more monophyletic groups of descendants ( typically one such group ) . This term is used in both phylogenetics and linguistics . Groups that do include all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor are said to be monophyletic . A paraphyletic group is a monophyletic group from which one or more of the clades is excluded to form a separate group ( as in the paradigmatic example of reptiles and birds , shown in the picture ) . A group that is neither monophyletic nor paraphyletic is said to be polyphyletic ( Greek Ï Î Î '' Ï Ï ( polys ) , `` many '' ) . These terms were developed during the debates of the 1960s and 70s accompanying the rise of cladistics ( a clade is a term for a monophyletic group ) . Many of the older classifications contain paraphyletic groups , especially the traditional 2 â `` 6 kingdom systems and the classic division of the vertebrates . Paraphyletic groups are often erected on the basis of ( ancestral similarities ) instead of ( derived similarities ) . Examples of well-known paraphyletic groups includes : In most cladistics-based schools of taxonomy , the existence of paraphyletic groups ( as well as polyphyletic groups ) in a classification is discouraged . Monophyletic groups ( that is , clades ) are considered by these schools of thought to be the most important grouping of organisms , for the following reasons : Others argue that paraphyletic groups are necessary for a comprehensive classification including extinct groups , since each species , genus , and so forth necessarily originates from part of another . Ereshefsky notes that paraphyletic taxa are the result of anagenesis . For instance , the Prokaryote group is paraphyletic because it excludes many of its descendent organisms ( the Eukaryotes ) , yet the Prokaryote group is very useful because it has a clearly defined and significant distinction ( no cell nucleus ) from its excluded descendants . So , even though Prokaryotes are not a clade , the term is still useful . It has been suggested that paraphyletic groups be clearly marked to distinguish them from clades , for instance with asterisks : Reptilia \* . The term evolutionary grade is sometimes used for such groups . The concept of paraphyly has also been applied to historical linguistics , where the methods of cladistics have found some utility in comparing languages . For instance , the Formosan languages form a paraphyletic group of the Austronesian languages as the term refers to the nine branches of the Austronesian family that are not Malayo-Polynesian and restricted to the island of Taiwan .

Myriapoda is a subphylum of arthropods containing millipedes , centipedes , and others . The group contains 13,000 species , all of which are terrestrial . Although their name suggests they have myriad ( 10,000 ) legs , myriapods range from having over 750 legs ( Illacme plenipes ) to having fewer than ten legs . The fossil record of myriapods reaches back into the late Silurian , although molecular evidence suggests a diversification in the Cambrian Period , and Cambrian fossils exist which resemble myriapods . The scientific study of myriapods is myriapodology . Myriapods have a single pair of antennae and , in most cases , simple eyes . The mouthparts lie on the underside of the head , with an `` epistome '' and labrum forming the upper lip , and a pair of maxillae forming the lower lip . A pair of mandibles lie inside the mouth . Myriapods breathe through spiracles that connect to a tracheal system similar to that of insects . There is a long tubular heart that extends through much of the body , but usually few , if any , blood vessels . Malpighian tubules excrete nitrogenous waste into the digestive system , which typically consists of a simple tube . Although the ventral nerve cord has a ganglion in each segment , the brain is relatively poorly developed . During mating , male myriapods produce a packet of sperm , or spermatophore , which they must transfer to the female externally ; this process is often complex and highly developed . The female lays eggs which hatch as much shortened versions of the adults , with only a few segments and as few as three pairs of legs . The young add additional segments and limbs as they repeatedly moult to reach the adult form . Myriapods are most abundant in moist forests , where they fulfill an important role in breaking down decaying plant material , although a few live in grasslands , semi-arid habitats or even deserts . The majority are detritivorous , with the exception of centipedes , which are chiefly nocturnal predators . Pauropodans and symphylans are small , sometimes microscopic animals that resemble centipedes superficially and live in soils . Millipedes differ from the other groups in having their body segments fused into pairs , giving the appearance that each segment bears two pairs of legs , while the other three groups have a single pair of legs on each body segment . Although not generally considered dangerous to humans , many myriapods produce noxious secretions ( often containing benzoquinones ) which can cause temporary blistering and discolouration of the skin . There has been much debate as to which arthropod group is most closely related to the Myriapoda . Under the Mandibulata hypothesis , Myriapoda is the sister taxon to Pancrustacea , a group comprising the Crustacea and Hexapoda . Under the Atelocerata hypothesis , Hexapoda is the closest , whereas under the Paradoxopoda hypothesis , Chelicerata is the closest . This last hypothesis , although supported by few , if any , morphological characters , is supported by a number of molecular studies . There are four classes of extant myriapods , Chilopoda ( centipedes ) , Diplopoda , Pauropoda and Symphyla , containing a total of around 12,000 species . While each of these groups of myriapods is believed to be monophyletic , relationships among them are less certain . Centipedes make up the order Chilopoda . They are fast , predatory and venomous , hunting mostly at night . There are around 3,300 species , ranging from the diminutive Nannarup hoffmani ( less than half an inch in length , mm ) to the giant Scolopendra gigantea , which may exceed 30 c. Most millipedes are slower than centipedes , and feed on leaf litter and detritus . They are distinguished by the fusion of each pair of body segments into a single unit , giving the appearance of having two pairs of legs per segment . Around 8,000 species have been described , which may represent less than a tenth of the true global millipede diversity . One species , Illacme plenipes has the greatest number of legs of any animal , with 750 . The name `` millipede '' is a compound word formed from the Latin roots milli ( `` thousand '' ) and ped ( `` foot '' ) , although millipedes typically have between 36 and 400 legs . Pill millipedes are much shorter , and are capable of rolling up into a ball , like pillbugs . About 200 species of symphylans are known worldwide . They resemble centipedes but are smaller and translucent . Many spend their lives as soil infauna , but some live arboreally . Juveniles have six pairs of legs , but , over a lifetime of several years , add an additional pair at each moult so that the adult instar has twelve pairs of legs . Pauropoda is another small group of small myriapods . They are typically 0.5 â `` 2.0 mm long and live in the soil on all continents except Antarctica . Over 700 species have been described . They are believed to be the sister group to millipedes , and have the dorsal tergites fused across pairs of segments , similar to the more complete fusion of segments seen in millipedes . Arthropleurids were ancient myriapods that are now extinct . The most famous members are from the genus Arthropleura , which was a giant , probably herbivorous , animal that could be up to 3 m long . Arthropleuridea may be a division of the millipedes .

Petrified wood ( from the Greek root petro meaning `` rock '' or `` stone '' ; literally `` wood turned into stone '' ) is the name given to a special type of fossilized remains of terrestrial vegetation . It is the result of a tree having turned completely into stone by the process of permineralization . All the organic materials have been replaced with minerals ( most often a silicate , such as quartz ) , while retaining the original structure of the wood . Unlike other types of fossils which are typically impressions or compressions , petrified wood is a three dimensional representation of the original organic material . The petrifaction process occurs underground , when wood becomes buried under sediment and is initially preserved due to a lack of oxygen which inhibits aerobic decomposition . Mineral-laden water flowing through the sediment deposits minerals in the plant 's cells and as the plant 's lignin and cellulose decay , a stone mould forms in its place . In general , wood takes fewer than 100 years to petrify . The organic matter needs to become petrified before it decomposes completely . A forest where the wood has petrified becomes known as a petrified forest . Elements such as manganese , iron and copper in the water\/mud during the petrification process give petrified wood a variety of color ranges . Pure quartz crystals are colorless , but when contaminants are added to the process the crystals take on a yellow , red , or other tint . Petrified wood can preserve the original structure of the wood in all its detail , down to the microscopic level . Structures such as tree rings and the various tissues are often observed features . Petrified wood has a Mohs hardness of 7 , the same as quartz crystal . Petrified wood is the provincial stone of Alberta and also the state gem of Washington . Artificial petrified wood has been produced in a Washington laboratory . In the process small cubes of pine were soaked in an acid bath for two days , then in a silica solution for another two . The product was then cooked at 1400 Â C in an argon atmosphere for two hours . The result was silicon carbide ceramic which preserved the intricate cell structure of the wood . Soaking in a tungsten solution produced a tungsten carbide petrified wood .
In Bod , the lowest ever recorded temperature in Romania , -38.5 degrees Celsius ( -37 Fahrenheit ) , was measured in January 1942 . Calafat is a city in Dolj County , Romania , on the river Danube , opposite the Bulgarian city of Vidin , to which it is linked by ferryboat . The construction of the Calafat-Vidin Bridge is planned between the two cities . It was founded in the 14th century by Genoese colonists , who employed large numbers of workmen ( Calfats ) in repairing ships . This industry gave the town its name . In January 1854 , during the Crimean War , when Russian forces were headed up the Danube , Ahmed Pasha , commanding the Turkish forces at Calafat , made a surprise attack on the Russian garrison at nearby Cetate , which was under the command of Colonel Alexander Baumgarten . This diverted the initial Russian attack and allowed Ahmed Pasha to consolidate his forces in Calafat . On 28 January the Russians under the command of General Iosif Romanovich Anrep reached Calafat and began the siege which lasted until May . Riddled by disease and unable to take the town , Anrep withdrew . Calafat lies on the river corridor VII-Danube and the pan-European corridor IV which starts in Germany and ends in Istanbul and Thessaloniki . The city is at crossroads of DN56 , DN56A , DN55A and E79 . Between the city of Calafat and neighbor , Vidin ( Bulgaria ) , stands links made by specially equipped vessels ( tanks ) , and there are plans to build a bridge over the Danube in the area called BaÅ cov ( whose construction will be completed in 2010 ) by the Spanish company FCC . The project of constructing a bridge in the area Calafat-Vidin dates from the year 1925 . Road traffic between Vidin and Calafat doubles every year , so it has become necessary to construct a bridge that will have four lanes of traffic road , a railway line , a lane two meters wide for bikes and a pavement for pedestrians . The bridge will have a total length of 1,971 m and it will cost over 100 million euros . Calafat has several city newspapers . One of them is called Ziarul De Calafat , which is also maintained online ; another is Calafat Live .

Meurthe-et-Moselle is a department in the Lorraine region of France , named after the Meurthe and Moselle rivers . Meurthe-et-Moselle was created in 1871 at the end of the Franco-Prussian War from the parts of the former departments of Moselle and Meurthe which remained French territory . The current boundary between Meurthe-et-Moselle and Moselle was the border between France and Germany from 1871 to 1919 and again between 1940 and 1944 . The only subsequent change took place in 1997 and involved the incorporation , for administrative reasons , of the little commune of Han-devant-Pierrepont which had previously fallen within the Moselle department . Meurthe-et-Moselle is part of the region of Lorraine and is surrounded by the departments of Meuse , Vosges , Bas-Rhin , and Moselle and by the nations of Luxembourg and Belgium . Its extends from north to south for 130 kilometers and between 7 and 103 kilometers from west to east . The economy was highly dependent on mining until the 1960s . There are iron , salt , and lime extraction sites . The urban area around Nancy has a very dynamic economy based largely on services , research , and higher education . The inhabitants of the department are called Meurthe-et-Mosellans . The area around Nancy has become highly urbanized , whereas the Santois in the south is quite rural .

Air Europa started in 1986 ( registered in Spain as Air EspaÃ a SA and previously known as such ) as part of the British ILG-Air Europe Group and 75 % owned by Spanish banks . It originally had a similar livery to Air Europe but with Air Europa titles , aircraft were registered in Spain and flew holiday charters from Mediterranean resorts and European cities using a Boeing 737-300 . It was the first Spanish private company to operate national scheduled flights ( besides charter flights which used to be its main business ) . When parent company ILG ceased trading in 1991 Air Europa continued profitably with a larger fleet of Boeing 737s . It signed a franchise agreement with Iberia in January 1998 , but this has since been dissolved . It is now owned by Globalia CorporaciÃ n Empresarial S.A. . At the end of the 1990s Boeing 737-800 jets were introduced along with a new livery . In June 2005 it was announced among the four future associate members of SkyTeam alliance , due to join by 2006 . However , the joining date was postponed , and became a member on 1 September 2007 . Air Europa was the parent company for Air Dominicana , the new flag carrier of the Dominican Republic , until bankruptcy was declared on 21 September 2009 . As of March 2011 , the Air Europa fleet consists of the following aircraft with an average age of 7.6 years :
The BBC Symphony Orchestra is the principal broadcast orchestra of the British Broadcasting Corporation and one of the leading orchestras in Britain . The orchestra was founded as a full time organization in 1930 , with Adrian Boult as its first chief conductor . He remained chief conductor until 1950 , when Malcolm Sargent took over ( holding the post until 1957 ) . Other principal conductors have included Antal DorÃ ti ( 1962 â `` 66 ) , Colin Davis ( 1967 â `` 71 ) , Pierre Boulez ( 1971 â `` 75 ) , Gennady Rozhdestvensky ( 1978 â `` 81 ) Andrew Davis ( no relation to Colin ) ( 1989 â `` 2000 ) , and Leonard Slatkin ( 2000 â `` 2004 ) . In 2005 , the Czech conductor , JiÅ Ã BÄ lohlÃ vek was named the orchestra 's 12th Chief Conductor , the first former BBC SO Principal Guest Conductor to become its Chief Conductor . He became Chief Conductor in 2006 with the First Night of The Proms 2006 . His contract as Chief Conductor is currently due to expire in 2012 . As well as these principal conductors , the orchestra has had several notable guest conductors , including Arturo Toscanini , who made a series of commercial recordings with the orchestra in Queen 's Hall from 1937 to 1939 , which were released by His Master 's Voice in the UK and RCA Victor in the US . EMI later issued recordings of broadcast concerts with Toscanini and the orchestra . Past Principal Guest Conductors have included Charles Mackerras ( 1977 â `` 1979 ) , Michael Gielen ( 1978 â `` 1981 ) , GÃ 1\/4 nter Wand , Mark Elder ( 1982 â `` 1985 ) , Peter EÃ tvÃ s ( 1985 â `` 1988 ) , Alexander Lazarev ( 1992 â `` 1995 ) , BÄ lohlÃ vek ( 1995 â `` 2000 ) , and Jukka-Pekka Saraste ( 2002 â `` 2005 ) . The current Principal Guest Conductor is the American conductor David Robertson , since October 2005 , and his contract currently runs to 2011 . The orchestra primarily performed in Queen 's Hall until the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 , curtailing that year 's season of Proms . The orchestra was then evacuated to Bristol , where it was initially left largely unused . Due to Bristol 's strategic status as a port it suffered heavy bombing , so the orchestra was relocated to Bedford in July 1941 . The 1940 and 1941 Proms seasons were run without BBC involvement , but the BBC returned in 1942 . The Queen 's Hall was destroyed by a Luftwaffe incendiary bomb on 11 May 1941 , prompting the move of the Proms to their current location in the Royal Albert Hall . Outside the Proms season , broadcast concerts and recordings were then moved to the Bedford School , and after the launch of the V-1 raids in 1944 the remaining broadcast concerts of that year 's Proms season were performed at the Bedford Corn Exchange . A memorable 1944 recording of Sir Edward Elgar 's Symphony No. 2 , conducted by Sir Adrian Boult , was later reissued on CD by EMI , along with shorter works of Elgar recorded during the 1930s in Queen 's Hall . The BBC SO is Associate Orchestra of the Barbican in London and gives an annual season of concerts there . The orchestra is the principal orchestra of The Proms , the annual season of concerts played at the Royal Albert Hall , giving around a dozen concerts each season , including the First and Last Nights , the most concerts of any single orchestra during The Proms . All concerts are broadcast on BBC Radio 3 , streamed online and available on the BBC iPlayer for seven days after broadcast , and a number are televised , giving the BBC Symphony Orchestra the highest broadcast profile of any UK orchestra . Central to its life are studio recordings for BBC Radio 3 at the Orchestraâ s Maida Vale home , some of which are free for the public to attend . In addition to these BBC-produced recordings , the orchestra has recorded for several commercial labels , including Teldec , Deutsche Grammophon , and Chandos . Performing throughout the world , the BBC SO has recently given concerts in Spain , Germany , the Czech Republic , Italy , and Taiwan . The Orchestra is committed to innovative education work . Recent projects include a day of free music for communities across West London , as part of Proms Out + About , and last November the Orchestra cleared its schedule for a week-long celebration of the music and culture of Turkey involving Turkish musicians and people of all ages from across London . Among ongoing projects are the Family Music Intro scheme , introducing families to live classical music , BBC SO Student Zone and the highly successful BBC SO Family Orchestra . The orchestra frequently commissions works by contemporary composers , and is a particular champion of new British works . Harrison Birtwistle 's Earth Dances , Pierre Boulez ' Rituel in memoriam Bruno Maderna and John Tavener 's The Protecting Veil were all BBC commissions first played by the BBC Symphony Orchestra . In 2000 , the orchestra appointed its first Associate Composer , Mark-Anthony Turnage . John Adams became the BBC Symphony Orchestra 's Artist in Association in June 2003 . Composer and conductor Oliver Knussen took up the post of Artist in Association in July 2009 .
In Egyptian mythology , Serket ( also spelled Selket , Selchis , and Selkis ) is the goddess of healing stings and bites who originally was the deification of the scorpion . Scorpion stings lead to paralysis and Serket 's name describes this , as it means ( she who ) tightens the throat , however , Serket 's name also can be read as meaning ( she who ) causes the throat to breathe , and so , as well as being seen as stinging the unrighteous , Serket was seen as one who could cure scorpion stings and the effects of other poisons such as snake bites . In Ancient Egyptian art , Serket was shown as a scorpion ( a symbol found on the earliest artifacts of the culture , such as the protodynastic period ) , or as a woman with a scorpion on her head . Although Serket does not appear to have had temples , she had a sizable number of priests in many communities . The most dangerous species of scorpion resides in North Africa , and its sting may kill , so Serket was considered a highly important goddess , and was sometimes considered by pharaohs to be their patron . Her close association with the early kings implies that she was their protector , two being referred to as the scorpion kings . As the protector against poisons and snake bites , Serket often was said to protect the deities from Apep , the great snake-demon of evil , sometimes being depicted as the guard when Apep was captured . As many of the venomous creatures of Egypt could prove fatal , Serket also was considered a protector of the dead , particularly being associated with poisons and fluids causing stiffening . She was thus said to be the protector of the tents of embalmers , and of the canopic jar associated with poison -- the jar of the intestine -- which was deified later as Qebehsenuf , one of the Four sons of Horus . As the guard of one of the canopic jars and a protector , Serket gained a strong association with Aset ( Isis ) , Nebet Het ( Nephthys ) , and Neith who also performed similar functions . Eventually , later in Egyptian history that spanned thousands of years and whose pantheon evolved toward a merger of many deities , Serket began to be identified with Isis , sharing imagery and parentage , until finally , Serket became said to be merely an aspect of Isis , whose cult had become very dominant .
Graham James Arnold ( born 3 August 1963 in Sydney , New South Wales ) is a former coach of the Australian national football ( soccer ) team . He was appointed to work as an assistant to Frank Farina in 2000 . The two replaced Raul Blanco , who was the interim coach in charge after Terry Venables decided not to renew his contract with Soccer Australia after the failed World Cup campaign in 1997 . Although Farina was sacked in 2005 , Arnold and the rest of the coaching team survived and worked with coach Guus Hiddink for the Australian 2006 FIFA World Cup campaign , in which they made the second round of the finals . After Hiddink left , he became acting coach of the Socceroos . He is a member of the Football Federation Australia Football Hall of Fame . Arnold was a striker who started his career at Gwawley Bay in 1969 . He played for them until 1979 when he moved to Canterbury-Marrickville in the New South Wales Premier League . He then moved to Sydney Croatia in Australia 's now defunct National Soccer League , where he was both the league 's top goal scorer and player of the year in 1986 . This was followed by a move overseas , where he made a name for himself in the Netherlands , playing for Roda JC and NAC Breda . He also spent time in Belgium with R.F.C. de LiÃ ge and R. Charleroi S.C. . He went on to play for Sanfrecce Hiroshima in Japan towards the end of his career , before finally returning home to play for the Northern Spirit FC . Graham Arnold has represented Australia 's senior national team 54 times , scoring 19 goals ( 85 caps , 33 goals including unofficial matches and `` B '' internationals ) . He was given his full debut by Frank Arok in a World Cup Qualifier against Taiwan at Adelaide 's Hindmarsh Stadium on 23 October 1985 . He scored on his debut as the `` Socceroos '' went on to record a 7-0 victory . His international playing career came to a sad end on 29 November 1997 in a World Cup Qualifier against Iran at the MCG when the score ended 2-2 and Australia was eliminated on the away goals rule after leading 2-0 . Arnold had a cameo role as a coach very early on in his career . He was coach for 2 games whilst he was a player at Sydney Croatia during the 1989\/90 season . However , his proper coaching career started in 1998 , when he was appointed player\/manager of the Northern Spirit FC . He was the coach for 2 seasons , making the playoffs in their debut season . He was then appointed to the position of Australian assistant coach in 2000 , becoming acting coach in July 2006 , then appointed head coach in December 2006 . On 6 September 2006 Australia was defeated 2-0 in an Asian Cup qualifying game against lowly-ranked Kuwait . The FFA confirmed Arnold would remain Head Coach through to the end of 2007 Asian Cup campaign . Australia started their Asian Cup campaign poorly , drawing with Oman in its opening Group stage game in Bangkok . Media pressure focused on Arnold and on 13 July 2007 Australia were beaten 3-1 by Iraq in the 2007 Asian Cup . Following the match , Arnold told the assembled media ( in reference to some of the team 's higher profile members ) , `` There 's some players who seem like they do n't want to be here . I 'm extremely disappointed . '' Since the tournament , Arnold has continued his role as Manager of the Australian U-23 side that is in the final qualification stages for the 2008 Olympics . He was also linked with the manager 's position at Bolton Wanderers and Norwich City in England but lost out to Gary Megson and Glenn Roeder respectively . With the appointment of Dutchman Pim Verbeek as new Australia manager , Arnold along with Henk Duut will serve as his assistant with the national side . On 9 February 2010 , it was announced that Arnold will take on the position of head coach for the Central Coast Mariners until the end of the 2012\/2013 season .
Future dates of Eid al-Adha might face correction 10 days before the festivity , in case of deviant lunar sighting in Saudi Arabia for the start of the month Dhul Hijja . Salat al Eid also known as Salat al Eidain is the special prayer offered to commemorate two Islamic festivals . Both the Eids are collectively known as Eidain ( Ø Ù Ø Ù Ù ) in Arabic language . The two Islamic festivals are : On both the occasions this special prayer is usually offered in Eidgah , a place in the outskirts of the city dedicated for Salat al Eid . Different scholars interpret the importance of this Salah ( prayer ) differently . Salat al Eid is Wajib according to Hanafi scholars , Sunnah al Mu ` kkadah according to Maliki and Shaf ' i jurisprudence , and Fard according to Hanbali scholars . Some scholars say it is fard al-ayn and some said its fard al-kifaya . During the time of prophet Muhammad , it has been a practice that women and children too had participated in Salat al Eid . The time of Salat al Eid begins when sun reaches approximately two meters above the horizon until it reaches its meridian before Dhuhr . Adhering to the Sunnah , the time for Eid al Fitr prayer is delayed and Eid al Adha prayer is hastened , so as to facilitate distribution of Fitrah before the Eid al Fitr prayer and offer sacrifice after the Eid al Adha prayer .
A memoir ( from the French : mÃ moire from the Latin memoria , meaning `` memory '' , or a reminiscence ) , is a literary genre , forming a subclass of autobiography â `` although the terms ` memoir ' and ` autobiography ' are almost interchangeable . Memoir is autobiographical writing , but not all autobiographical writing follows the criteria for memoir set out below . The author of a memoir may be referred to as a memoirist . Memoirs are structured differently from formal autobiographies which tend to encompass the writer 's entire life span , focusing on the development of his or her personality . The chronological scope of a memoir is determined by the work 's context and is therefore more focused and flexible than the traditional arc of birth to childhood to old age as found in an autobiography . Memoirs tended to be written by politicians or people in court society , later joined by military leaders and businessmen , and often dealt exclusively with the writer 's careers rather than their private life . Historically , memoirs have dealt with public matters , rather than personal . Many older memoirs contain little or no information about the writer , and are almost entirely concerned with other people . Modern expectations have changed this , even for heads of government . Like most autobiographies , memoirs are generally written from the first person point of view . Gore Vidal , in his own memoir Palimpsest , gave a personal definition : `` a memoir is how one remembers one 's own life , while an autobiography is history , requiring research , dates , facts double-checked . '' It is more about what can be gleaned from a section of one 's life than about the outcome of the life as a whole . Humorist Will Rogers put it a little more pithily : `` Memoirs means when you put down the good things you ought to have done and leave out the bad ones you did do . '' Contemporary practices of writing memoirs for recreational , family or therapeutic purposes are sometimes referred to as legacy writing or personal history . Such products may be assisted by professional or amateur genealogists , or by ghostwriters . The rhetor Libanius ( ca . 314 â `` ca . This kind of memoir refers to the idea in ancient Greece and Rome , that memoirs were like `` memos , '' pieces of unfinished and unpublished writing which a writer might use as a memory aid to make a more finished document later on . In modern times , memoirs have often been written by politicians or military leaders as a way to record and publish their own account of their public exploits . Some contemporary women writers have combined the memoir form with historical non-fiction writing . Examples include Jung Chang 's Wild Swans , Heda Margolius Kovaly 's Under a Cruel Star and Helen Epstein 's Where She Came From . Other professional contemporary writers such as David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs have specialized in writing amusing essays in the form of memoirs . To some extent this is an extension of the tradition of newspaper columnists ' regular accounts of their lives . ( Cf . the work of James Thurber which often has a strong memoir-like content ) . With the expressed interest of preserving history through the eyes of those who lived it , there are many organizations that work with potential memoirists to bring their work to fruition . The Veterans History Project , for example , compiles the memoirs of those who have served in a branch of the US Military - especially those who have seen active combat . Many public libraries give Memoir Writing classes that are geared towards senior citizens and some autobiographical service companies periodically publish memoir collections featuring clients that participated at no cost .
Under the Volcano is a 1947 semi-autobiographical novel by English writer Malcolm Lowry ( 1909 â `` 1957 ) . The novel tells the story of Geoffrey Firmin , an alcoholic British consul in the small Mexican town of Quauhnahuac ( the Aztec name of Cuernavaca ) , on the Day of the Dead , November 2 , 1938 . The book takes its name from Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl , the twin volcanos near where Lowry lived . It was adapted to radio on Studio One in 1947 and made into a film in 1984 . The 1976 Canadian Documentary Volcano : An Inquiry Into the Life and Death of Malcolm Lowry was nominated for an Academy Award . The Under the Volcano Festival of Art and Social Change takes place annually in North Vancouver , British Columbia , in the same location where Malcolm Lowry wrote the novel . In 1998 , the Modern Library ranked Under the Volcano as number 11 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century . In 1940 , Lowry hired an agent , Harold Matson , to find a publisher for the manuscript , but it was rejected many times . Although he continued refining it for years , this original 1940 version was later published in 1994 under the title The 1940 Under the Volcano . In 1944 , the manuscript was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry 's shack in British Columbia . His second wife , Margerie , rescued the unfinished novel , but all of Lowry 's other works in progress were lost in the blaze . The novel as it is recognized today was finally finished in 1945 and immediately sent to many publishers . In late winter , while traveling in Mexico , Lowry learned the novel had been accepted by two publishing companies : Reynal & Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in the United Kingdom . Following critical reports from readers , Cape had reservations about publishing and wrote to Lowry on November 29 , 1945 asking him to make drastic cuts . Lowry 's lengthy reply , dated January 2 , 1946 , was a passionate defense of the book in which he sensed he had created a work of lasting greatness : `` Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk . But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time . '' The letter includes a detailed summary of the book 's key themes and how the author intended each of the 12 chapters to work , and has been included as an introduction in some editions . There have been many editions of the book since 1947 . In 1998 it was rated as number 11 on the list of the 100 best novels of the 20th century compiled by the Modern Library . Time included the novel in its list of `` 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to the present '' . Geoffrey Firmin is the alcoholic Consul living in Quauhnahuac . He is actually an ex-consul , recently resigned due to diplomatic strains between the UK and Mexico in the aftermath of President LÃ zaro CÃ rdenas 's 1938 nationalization of the country 's oil reserves . He wants to write a book , but his alcoholism affects all areas of his life , particularly his relationship with his ex-wife Yvonne . She has returned to Mexico after a long absence in order to rekindle their relationship . Hugh Firmin is Geoffrey 's half-brother . He visits Mexico to report on fascist activity for the London Globe , and he feels incredibly guilty for not acting in the Spanish Civil War . John Huston directed the 1984 film adaptation , Under the Volcano , with Albert Finney , Jacqueline Bisset , Anthony Andrews and Katy Jurado . It received Oscar nominations for Best Actor in a Leading Role ( Albert Finney ) and Best Music , Original Score . Volcano : An Inquiry Into the Life and Death of Malcolm Lowry ( 1976 ) is a National Film Board of Canada documentary produced by Donald Brittain and Robert A. Duncan and directed by Brittain and John Kramer . It opens with the inquest into Lowry 's `` death by misadventure , '' and then moves back in time to trace the writer 's life . Selections from Lowry 's novel are read by Richard Burton amid images shot in Mexico , the United States , Canada and England . Bob Dylan 's song `` Just Like Tom Thumb 's Blues '' alludes to the novel . The novel was the inspiration for the 1974 song `` The Consul at Sunset '' by Jack Bruce of Cream ( words by Pete Brown ) , as well as for the song `` Back Room Of The Bar '' by the Young Fresh Fellows , from their 1987 album The Men Who Loved Music . Matthew Good , a Canadian musician , makes reference to Malcolm Lowry and Under the Volcano in his live album release Live at Massey Hall in the introduction to his song `` I 'm a Window '' . The Bears had a song called `` Under The Volcano '' .
Lodging ( or a holiday accommodation ) is a type of residential accommodation . People who travel and stay away from home for more than a day need lodging for sleep , rest , safety , shelter from cold temperatures or rain , storage of luggage and access to common household functions . Lodgings may be self catering in which case no food is laid on but cooking facilities are available . Lodging is done in a hotel , hostel or hostal , a private home ( commercial , i.e. a bed and breakfast , a guest house , a vacation rental , or non-commercially , with members of hospitality services or in the home of friends ) , in a tent , caravan\/camper ( often on a campsite ) . In addition there are make-shift solutions . Sleeping is typically done lying in a bed , or more generally on a soft surface , such as an air mattress , a couch , etc. . Some trains have sleeping cars . Sometimes people sleep sitting , because lying is not possible , such as in a train ( if not in a sleeping car ) , a bus , a seat in a waiting room or a bench on the street or in a park . Inclinable seats allow something between sitting and lying . Whether lying on a row of seats is possible and comfortable depends on the presence of arm rests , and whether they can be moved up . In some public places , lying would be possible , but is not permitted .
The Statute of Labourers was a law enacted by the English parliament under King Edward III in 1351 in response to a labor shortage , designed to stabilize the labor force by prohibiting increases in wages and prohibiting the movement of workers from their home areas in search of improved conditions . It was introduced by John Hale . The Black Death or Bubonic Plague , which killed more than one-third of the population of Europe ( mostly peasants ) , caused a dramatic decrease in the supply of labor . Landowners suddenly faced a sharp increase in competition for workers . Labourers had increased bargaining power and commanded higher wages . The increase in labor cost also led to inflation throughout the economy . The elite class lamented the sudden shift in economic power . In an attempt to control labor costs and price levels , Edward III issued the Ordinance of Labourers in 1349 . Parliament attempted to reinforce the Ordinance with the Statute of Labourers . The statute set a maximum wage for labourers that was commensurate to wages paid before the Black Death , specifically , in the year 1346 . These changes , however , failed to take into account the changing economic conditions during the Black Death , and furthermore the period from which wage levels were taken was one of economic depression in England as a result of The Hundred Years ' War . Therefore , wages during the Black Death were set even lower to match those during this depression . It also mandated that able-bodied men and women work , and imposed harsh penalties for those who remained idle . In practice , the statute was poorly enforced and unsuccessful , but it set a precedent that distinguished between labourers who were `` able in body '' to work and those who could not work for whatever reasons . This distinction resurfaced in later laws regarding poverty . The Ordinance of Labourers and Statute of Labourers were , of course , very unpopular with the peasants , who wanted higher wages and better living standards , and was a contributing factor to subsequent peasant revolts , most notably the English peasants ' revolt of 1381 . Similar processes happened throughout Europeâ '' wage caps following a labor shortage after the Black Death resulting in popular revolts .
Tadeusz Reichstein ( July 20 , 1897 -- August 1 , 1996 ) was a Polish-born Swiss chemist and Nobel laureate . Reichstein was born into a Jewish family at WÅ ocÅ awek , Congress Poland , and spent his early childhood at Kiev , where his father was an engineer . He began his education at boarding-school in Jena , Germany . In 1933 , working in ZÃ 1\/4 rich , Switzerland , Reichstein succeeded , independently of Sir Norman Haworth and his collaborators in the United Kingdom , in synthesizing vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) in what is now called the Reichstein process . Together with E. C. Kendall and P. S. Hench , he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1950 for their work on hormones of the adrenal cortex which culminated in the isolation of cortisone . He died in Basel , Switzerland . The principal industrial process for the artificial synthesis of Vitamin C still bears his name . Reichstein was the longest-lived Nobel laureate at the time of his death , but was surpassed in 2008 by Rita Levi-Montalcini .

Jane Means Appleton Pierce ( March 12 , 1806 -- December 2 , 1863 ) , wife of U.S. President Franklin Pierce , was First Lady of the United States from 1853 to 1857 . Born in Hampton , New Hampshire , the daughter of Reverend Jesse Appleton , a Congregationalist minister and second President of Bowdoin College , and Elizabeth Means-Appleton , Jane was a petite , frail , shy , melancholy figure . After the death of her father , who had served as president of Bowdoin College not long before Franklin enrolled there , she at age 13 moved into the mansion of her wealthy maternal grandparents in Amherst , New Hampshire . How she met Pierce , a young lawyer with political ambitions , is unknown , but her brother-in-law Alpheus S. Packard ( who had married Jane 's sister Frances ) was one of Pierce 's professors at Bowdoin . Franklin , aged almost 30 , married Jane , aged 28 , on November 19 , 1834 , at the home of the bride 's maternal grandparents in Amherst . Theirs was a small wedding , conducted by a brother-in-law of Jane , the Reverend Silas Aiken . The couple honeymooned six days at the boardinghouse of Sophie near Washington , D.C. Pierce was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives by the time they married , and became a U.S. Senator in 1837 . Mrs. Pierce hated life in Washington , D.C. , and encouraged Pierce to resign his Senate seat and return to New Hampshire , which he did in 1842 . Service in the Mexican-American War brought Pierce the rank of Brigadier General and local fame as a hero . He returned home safely , and for four more years the Pierces lived quietly at Concord , New Hampshire , in the happiest period of their lives , where Jane watched her son Benjamin `` Bennie '' grow up . In 1852 , the Democratic Party made Pierce their candidate for President . His wife fainted at the news . When Pierce took her to Newport for a respite , eleven-year-old Bennie wrote to her : `` I hope he wo n't be elected for I should not like to be at Washington and I know you would not either . '' But the President-elect convinced Jane that his office would be an asset for Bennie 's success in life . The Pierces apparently had genuine affection for one another , but quarreled often and gradually drifted apart . She opposed Pierce 's decision to run for president , for she much preferred private life . When her son Bennie was killed in a train accident before Pierce was sworn in as President , she believed God was displeased with her husband 's political ambitions . After the deaths of her children , Mrs. Pierce was overcome with melancholia and distanced herself during her husband 's presidency . She never recovered from the tragedy . For nearly two years , she remained in the upstairs living quarters of the White House , spending her days writing maudlin letters to her dead son . She left the social chores to her aunt Abby Kent-Means and her close friend Varina Davis , wife of War Secretary Jefferson Davis . Mrs. Pierce made her first official appearance as First Lady at a New Year 's Day reception in 1855 and thereafter served as White House hostess intermittently . When the first Christmas Tree appeared in the White House in 1856 , Mrs. Pierce has since been given credit for starting this presidential tradition . Pierce died of tuberculosis ( as her father had ) in Andover , Massachusetts , on December 2 , 1863 . She was buried at Old North Cemetery in Concord , New Hampshire ; her husband was interred beside her in 1869 .
`` Golden Brown '' is a song by the English rock band The Stranglers . It was released as a 7 '' single in December 1981 , on Liberty . It was the second single released from the band 's sixth album La Folie . Originally featured on the group 's album La Folie , which was released in November 1981 , and later on some pressings of Feline , `` Golden Brown '' was released as a single in December 1981 , and was accompanied by a video . It reached # 2 in the official UK singles chart in February 1982 , behind `` Town Called Malice '' by The Jam . It was the comparatively conservative BBC Radio Two , at that time a middle-of-the-road ( MOR ) music radio station , which decided to make the record the single of the week , a surprising step considering the band were almost as notorious as Sex Pistols only a few short years before . The fourth line of the song , `` With my mind she runs , '' is a common source of mondegreens . The band claimed that the song 's lyrics were akin to an aural Rorschach test and that people only heard in it what they wanted to hear , although this did not prevent persistent allegations that the lyrics alluded to heroin ( although in an interview with Channel 4 , drummer Jet Black quipped it was a song about Marmite ) . The single was a hit around the world , scaling the Top 10 as far away as Australia . Its commercial success was probably the single factor that secured The Stranglers their continuing life in pop mainstream for the remainder of the 1980s . It was also featured in the 2000 film , Snatch , and is included on the accompanying soundtrack album . There has been much controversy surrounding the lyrics . In his 2001 book The Stranglers Song By Song , Hugh Cornwell clearly states '' ` Golden Brown ' works on two levels . It 's about heroin and also about a girl '' . Essentially the lyrics describe how `` both provided me with pleasurable times '' . The song is a waltzing , harpsichord-led ballad alternating between 3\/4 and 4\/4 . The song 's characteristic opening phrase consists of three bars of 3\/4 and one bar of 4\/4 . The music was largely written by keyboardist Dave Greenfield and drummer Jet Black , with lyrics by Hugh Cornwell . The video for `` Golden Brown '' depicts the band members both as explorers in an Arabic country ( images of the Pyramids in the sequence allude to the Giza area of Egypt ) in the 1920s and performers for a fictional `` Radio Cairo '' . In addition to the Pyramids the video is intercut with stock footage of a madrassa in Uzbekistan , the Shah Mosque in Isfahan , Iran and Great Sphinx , Feluccas sailing , and Bedouins riding and camel racing in the United Arab Emirates . The performance scenes were filmed in the Leighton House Museum in Holland Park , London . Songs , lyrics , and music by The Stranglers .

It is bounded by ( from the west and clockwise ) the districts Harz , BÃ rde , Magdeburg , Jerichower Land , Anhalt-Bitterfeld , Mansfeld-S Ã 1\/4 dharz and Saalekreis . The district was established by merging the former districts of Bernburg , SchÃ nebeck and Aschersleben-Sta Ã furt ( except the town Falkenstein ) as part of the reform of 2007 .
A vine ( Latin vÄ `` nea `` grapevine '' , `` vineyard '' , from vÄ `` num `` wine '' ) in the broad sense refers to any climbing or trailing plant . The narrower and original meaning is the grapevine ( Vitis ) . Certain plants always grow as vines , while a few grow as vines only part of the time . For instance , poison ivy and bittersweet can grow as low shrubs when support is not available , but will become vines when support is available . A vine displays a growth form based on long stems . This has two purposes . A vine may use rock exposures , other plants , or other supports for growth rather than investing energy in a lot of supportive tissue , enabling the plant to reach sunlight with a minimum investment of energy . This has been a highly successful growth form for plants such as kudzu and Japanese honeysuckle , both of which are invasive exotics in parts of North America . There are some tropical vines that develop skototropism , and grow away from the light , a type of negative phototropism . Growth away from light allows the vine to reach a tree trunk , which it can then climb to brighter regions . The vine growth form may also enable plants to colonize large areas quickly , even without climbing high . This is the case with periwinkle and ground ivy . It is also an adaptation to life in areas where small patches of fertile soil are adjacent to exposed areas with more sunlight but little or no soil . A vine can root in the soil but have most of its leaves in the brighter , exposed area , getting the best of both worlds . A climbing habit has evolved independently in several plant families , using many different climbing methods . Some plants climb by twining their stems around a support ( e.g. , morning glories , Ipomoea species ) . Others climb by way of adventitious , clinging roots ( e.g. , ivy , Hedera species ) , with twining petioles ( e.g. , Clematis species ) , or using tendrils , which can be specialized shoots ( Vitaceae ) , leaves ( Bignoniaceae ) , or even inflorescences ( Passiflora ) . Others climb through the use of thorns , which pierce the support ( e.g. climbing rose ) ; or by other hooked structures , such as hooked branches ( e.g. Artabotrys hexapetalus ) . The climbing fetterbush ( Pieris phillyreifolia ) is a woody shrub-vine which climbs without clinging roots , tendrils , or thorns . It directs its stem into a crevice in the bark of fibrous barked trees ( such as bald cypress ) where the stem adopts a flattened profile and grows up the tree underneath the host tree 's outer bark . The fetterbush then sends out branches that emerge near the top of the tree . Species of Parthenocissus ( Vitaceae ) produce twining tendrils that are modified stems , but which also produce adhesive pads at the end that attach themselves quite strongly to the support . The evolution of a climbing habit has been implicated as a key innovation associated with the evolutionary success and diversification of a number of taxonomic groups of plants . Most vines are flowering plants . These may be divided into woody vines or lianas , such as wisteria , kiwifruit , and common ivy , and herbaceous ( nonwoody ) vines , such as morning glory . One odd group of vining plants is the fern genus Lygodium , called climbing ferns . The stem does not climb , but rather the fronds ( leaves ) do . The fronds unroll from the tip , and theoretically never stop growing . In the meantime , they can form thickets as they unroll over other plants , rockfaces , and fences . Gardeners can use the tendency of climbing plants to grow quickly . If a plant display is wanted quickly , a climber can achieve this . Climbers can be trained over walls , pergolas , fences , etc. . Climbers can be grown over other plants to provide additional attraction . Artificial support can also be provided . Some climbers climb by themselves ; others need work , such as tying them in and training them .
Alan White ( born 14 June 1949 ) is an English rock drummer known for his work with the progressive rock band Yes . White was also a member of the Plastic Ono Band , playing live in 1969 at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival , which was recorded and released three months later as Live Peace in Toronto 1969 . In all , White has appeared on over fifty albums with artists including John Lennon , George Harrison , Joe Cocker , Ginger Baker , and The Ventures . Born in Pelton County Durham , White began learning to play the piano at age six and after switching to drums , played publicly with a local band at 13 . Later he worked with a number of bands during the late 1960s , notably the Alan Price Set , before being invited to join Ginger Baker 's Airforce with Steve Winwood in 1968 . The following year , 1969 , White received a call from John Lennon ( he thought it was a prankster ) asking him to join the Plastic Ono Band for a show that became the hit album , Live Peace in Toronto . He also performed with Lennon on the Imagine album and the single , `` Instant Karma '' . When Lennon introduced White to George Harrison , he was asked to perform on the All Things Must Pass album . In 1972 , White was touring with Joe Cocker when he received an invitation to join Yes , to replace Bill Bruford who had left to join King Crimson . Three days after meeting with Jon Anderson and Chris Squire , White played at the first show of the group 's US Close to the Edge tour . Despite the fact that White had spent time in the studio with the band and even tried playing some of the Close to the Edge material , it was still a substantial challenge for him to learn the band 's live set in just three days . White and the band gave each other three months to see if he fit in , and over thirty years later , he has appeared on every Yes album since . Alan White released his only solo album , Ramshackled , in 1976 . In addition to his drum playing , White has played piano and written music for several Yes albums . Alan White had guested with local Seattle band MerKaBa on a number of occasions and Alan White and MerKaBa also had links with another local band , Treason . In 2003 , Alan White joined sessions for a new MerKaBa album , but these evolved into a new band , called White , and an album 's worth of demo recordings under the name Loyal . As well as Alan , the band consisted of Kevin Currie ( from MerKaBa ; lead vocals ) , Karl Haug ( from Treason ) ; electric & acoustic guitars , lap steel ) , Steve Boyce ( from MerKaBa ; bass , guitar , backing vocals ) and Ted Stockwell ( from Treason and MerKaBa ; keys , guitar ) . Stockwell left the band and , in April 2005 , was replaced by Alan 's former colleague in Yes , keyboardist Geoff Downes . A new album , White , was recorded , partly based on the Loyal demos . The album was released in 2006 , with a cover by Roger Dean . The band has played live ( with various keyboardists ) in the Seattle area . They were due to join the abortive More Drama Tour . The More Drama Tour , scheduled to begin in North America in August 2005 , was to have seen three acts , The Syn , White and Steve Howe touring together , with Chris Squire , Steve Howe , Alan White and Geoff Downes playing Yes material at the end of the evening ( with Currie handling lead vocals ) . However , the tour was canceled shortly before it was due to begin . Alan White later joined The Syn touring band for dates in the first half of 2006 . Subsequently , Alan White has been working on projects with Billy Sherwood , notably in the initial line-up of Circa , with a third Yes alumnus , Tony Kaye . In 2010 , the band White re-emerged after a hiatus with a new line-up of Alan White , Haug and Boyce joined by two musicians from Yes tribute band Parallels , who have previously worked with Alan : vocalist Robyn Dawn and keyboardist Jonathan Sindelman . White has been married for over twenty years to Gigi . They have two children , Jesse ( also a musician ) and Cassi . He currently lives in the Bellevue , WA area .
Duplo ( trademarked as DUPLO ) is a product range of the construction toy Lego , designed for children aged 1 Â 1\/2 to 6 years old . Duplo bricks are twice the length , height and width of traditional Lego bricks ( eight times the size in volume ) , and are easier to handle - as well as being far harder to swallow - by younger children . Despite their size , they are still compatible with traditional Lego bricks . Initially launched in 1969 , the Duplo range has gone on to include sets with figures , cars , houses and trains . The most common of all Duplo bricks is the 2x2 brick . The Duplo brand , and the first Duplo bricks appeared in 1969 . The bricks were available in four colors : red , yellow , blue , and white . The following year , two more sets were added with blue and red wheel plates . In the product catalog for 1971 , the sets were targeted at children from 1 to 2 years , but still sold mixed with Lego bricks , normally designed for ages 3 to 12 . In 1972 , the Duplo brick with 2 rows of 2 studs was introduced . In 1975 Duplo became its own product brand , with five sets made up exclusively of Duplo bricks . New additions included a round-topped 2 by 2 stud brick and a small 4-wheel wagon with two rows of 6 studs . With these new Duplo sets , Lego was targeting children 1 Â 1\/2 years old with the idea that when the children reached 3 , the Duplo bricks could be used together with regular Lego bricks . In 1977 the Duplo name was dropped in favor of Lego Preschool . Small figures the size of 2 by 2 knobs were introduced as well . They included a cylindrical head and a tapered body without any limbs ( similar in design to Fisher-Price 's Little People ) . Another new brick was a half arch . The new sets included figures , doors , and 2 by 6 knob wagons that could act as a car or train . The name Duplo was brought back in 1979 , along with a new reworked logo . The brick sets often came inside a plush version of the rabbit that zipped closed . In 1983 , other Duplo figures appeared , often called Duplo people . These figures have a moveable head , arms , and legs and look like large Lego minifigures , but the Duplo people can not be taken apart for safer handling by small children . Also in 1983 , set number 2700 was introduced with a model of a steam engine with two train cars . In 1986 , a Duplo doll house with sliding doors was introduced . This included a Duplo people mother , father , and smaller child . In 1992 , Duplo Toolo was introduced . These used internal screws to stay together . 1993 brought a gray rail train system with a stop and start track . Later , two more train systems arrived . In 2005 , Lego started selling Duplo trains themed as Thomas the Tank Engine . The name Duplo was dropped again in favor of Explore in 2002 . In the 2004 spring catalog there was a reminder that Duplo was now called Explore , but that fall the well known Duplo name was back yet again with a new rabbit logo designed to match the new elephant logo for the Lego Quatro range . Lego currently makes Duplo sets licensed with Bob the Builder and Thomas & Friends characters . Duplo sets now include farm , zoo , town , castle , and pirate lines . A doll house and princess castle are available as of 2008 . Some Duplo sets have cars , trucks , and buildings which can not be disassembled . Some DUPLO sets do not include building manuals . Duplo is manufactured in NyÃ regyhÃ za , Hungary .
When Night is Falling is a 1995 Canadian drama film directed by Patricia Rozema . The film stars Pascale BussiÃ res as Camille Baker , a university literature professor at a religious college struggling with both her tenure-track career and her troubled relationship with fellow professor Martin ( Henry Czerny ) . When a carnival subsequently comes to town , Camille is confused by her unexpected lesbian attraction to Petra ( Rachael Crawford ) , a sexy , free-spirited circus performer . The cast also includes Don McKellar , Clare Coulter , Tracy Wright and Tom Melissis . When Night is Falling was given the NC-17 rating by the MPAA , but surrendered the rating ; it was then released with no rating . The film was later released onto video with two versions : the original unrated version , and an R rated cut . The film makers appealed the NC-17 rating because of the highly negative stigma associated with NC-17 rated films , and because the NC-17 restricts the distribution and actual sales of such movies . The appeal , however , was declined , so When Night is Falling was released unrated .
For the book by William S. Burroughs , see Tornado Alley ( book ) . Tornado Alley is a colloquial and popular media term that most often refers to the area of the United States where tornadoes are most frequent . Although an official location is not defined , the area between the Rocky Mountains and Appalachian Mountains is usually associated with it . Although no U.S. state is entirely free of tornadoes , they are most frequent in the plains between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains . According to the storm events database of the National Climatic Data Center , Texas reports more tornadoes than any other state , though this state 's very large land area should be taken into account . Kansas and Oklahoma are second and third respectively for sheer number of tornadoes reported but report more per land area than Texas . However , the density of tornado occurrences in northern Texas is comparable to Oklahoma and Kansas . Florida also reports a high number and density of tornado occurrences , though only rarely do tornadoes there approach the strength of those that sometimes strike the southern plains . Although Tornado Alley is considered to be in the areas of the Central United States , no official definition of the term has actually been produced by the National Weather Service . According to the National Severe Storms Laboratory FAQ , `` Tornado Alley '' is a term created by the media to refer to areas that have greater numbers of tornadoes . There are several ideas of what Tornado Alley is , but those ideas are the result of the different criteria used to refer to it . 90 % of tornadoes hit this region of the U.S because cold , dry air from Canada and the Rocky Mountains meets warm , moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and hot , dry air from the Sonoran Desert , which combines with atmospheric instability to produce intense thunderstorms . The most common definition of Tornado Alley is the location where the strongest tornadoes occur most frequently and was first coined by Jennifer L. Wiley in 1904 . The core of Tornado Alley consists of the Texas Panhandle , Oklahoma , Kansas , Nebraska , eastern South Dakota , and the Colorado Eastern Plains . However , Tornado Alley can be also be defined as an area stretching from central Texas to the Canadian prairies and from eastern Colorado to western Pennsylvania . It can also be argued that there are numerous Tornado Alleys . In addition to the Texas\/Oklahoma\/Kansas core , such areas include the Ohio Valley , the southern Great Lakes , the Tennessee Valley and the lower Mississippi valley . The nickname , `` Dixie Alley '' is sometimes used for the areas in the southeastern U.S. -- notably the lower Mississippi Valley and the upper Tennessee Valley . This region is particularly vulnerable to violent , long tracked tornadoes . Also , an area stretching from southern Michigan to southern Indiana , and from eastern Illinois to western Ohio is sometimes referred to as Hoosier Alley . Tornadoes are common in the late spring and early summer months in this region , although they are rarely as violent as tornadoes in Tornado and Dixie Alleys . Some studies suggest that there are also smaller tornado alleys located across the United States .

Neustadt bei Coburg ( also written Neustadt b. Coburg ) is a municipality in the district of Coburg in northern Bavaria , Germany . It is situated 15 km northeast of Coburg , as its name indicates . In the second half of the 12th century , Count Hermann von Wolweswac founded the town of Neustadt with the building of a castle . Governance of the city was left to the Counts of Andechs , the later Dukes of Meranien . Neustadt is first mentioned in a document from the 16th of June , 1248 , describing the `` market forum '' ( `` Marktflecken '' ) of Neustadt . In 1316 , Neustadt was designated a City , and in 1353 , Neustadt came under the care of Coburg , making it a possession of the House of Wettin , which is remained until the First World War . Under Wettin rule , the city acquired the two-tailed , red and black lions which grace its coat of arms . Neustadt lay on a major trade route between NÃ 1\/4 rnberg and Leipzig , and in the 14th century , the city received a parish church . By the end of the Middle Ages , the city had a population of roughly 570 . By the time the Thirty Years ' War began , Neustadt 's population had grown to roughly 1000 . When the war began , the leaders of Coburg declared their neutrality . However , because the trade route on which Neustadt lay came to be used as a route of transportation by the various combatants , the city suffered greatly . Still greater damage came in 1636 , when a large fire , unrelated to the war , which burnt down over half of the city . In 1839 , a second , larger fire destroyed 179 of the city 's 226 houses , as well as the city hall and archives , and heavily damaged the church . When the First World War ended in 1918 and the Weimar Republic was founded , the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha ceased to be a duchy . At first , it formed the Free State of Coburg . This state proved so small as an administrative unit that the decision was made to have the Free State become a part of either Thuringia or Bavaria . A referendum , held in 1919 , saw Neustadt ( and the rest of the Free State of Coburg ) decide , by overwhelming majority , against Thuringia and thus for Bavaria . Neustadt politician and industrialist Max Oscar Arnold had actively campaigned for union with Bavaria . Most residents of Neustadt bei Coburg are members of the Evangelical Church ( Lutheranism ) . But there are also communities of Jehovah 's Witnesses , Seventh-day Adventists and Muslims .

Timothy `` T. J. '' Oshie , Jr. ( born December 23 , 1986 ) is an American professional ice hockey center currently playing for the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . He was drafted by St. Louis in the first round , 24th overall , in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft . Oshie played high school hockey for Warroad High School in Warroad , Minnesota for three seasons , leading the club to two Minnesota State Class A titles in 2003 and 2005 . He made the state 's All-Tournament Team all three years . With 100 points ( 37 goals , 63 assists ) in 31 games as a senior , he led all Minnesota high school players in scoring . He was subsequently named to 2005 Associated Press and Pioneer Press All-State First Team and was a Minnesota Mr. Hockey Finalist . At the completion of his senior season with the Warriors in 2004-05 , he joined the Sioux Falls Stampede of the United States Hockey League ( USHL ) for 11 games . In the off-season , he was selected 24th overall by the St. Louis Blues in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft . Following his draft , he played for the North Dakota Fighting Sioux of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association ( WCHA ) for three seasons . Scoring a team-leading 24 goals as a freshman , he added 21 assists for 45 points total . He additionally set a school record with nine game-winning goals in the season , which also led all NCAA players . He was named to the WCHA All-Rookie Team and the WCHA Final Five All-Tournament Team . In his sophomore year , he improved to 52 points ( 17 goals and 35 assists ) , ranking second in team scoring . He earned Third Team All-WCHA and received the Fighting Sioux 's Cliff `` Fido '' Purpur Award , given to the player who demonstrates hard work , determination , while generating excitement on the ice . Following North Dakota 's WCHA playoff run , Oshie led all players with eight points ( four goals and four assists ) in the 2006 NCAA Tournament , earning NCAA West All-Tournament honors . He played his last season with North Dakota as a junior , recording 45 points in 42 games . On May 13 , 2008 , Oshie opted to forego his senior season with the Fighting Sioux and signed with the St. Louis Blues . He scored his first career NHL goal on October 22 , 2008 , against the Detroit Red Wings . Oshie quickly became a fan favorite due to his fast and energetic style of play . Playing in 57 games , Oshie collected a 14 goals , 25 assists and 39 points during his rookie year . At the end of the season , he won the NHL 's 2008-09 `` Goal of the Year '' honors , a fan-voted contests on the league 's website , for an individual effort against the Vancouver Canucks on March 26 , 2009 . Receiving the puck in the neutral zone from linemate David Perron , he quickly cut away from the boards causing opposing forward Rick Rypien to fall down . He then deked laterally against defenseman Mattias Ã -- hlund , simultaneously forcing goaltender Roberto Luongo out of his net , leaving a wide-open net that he scored into . The goal tied the game 1-1 , leading to an eventual Blues win . Oshie broke his ankle in wrestling ` scrum ' with Samuel Pahlsson during a blowout loss against the Columbus Blue Jackets early in the 2010 â `` 11 season , missing three months to the injury . The Blues ' management benched Oshie for two games on March 29 , 2011 for an unexcused absence from practice , reportedly due to oversleeping . Oshie played with the United States national team at the 2006 World Junior Championships in Vancouver . Following the Blues ' elimination in the 2009 NHL playoffs , he received his first senior national team cap for the 2009 IIHF World Championship . Oshie also competed for the USA in the 2010 IIHF World Championship , scoring 4 goals and 2 assists in 6 games . Oshie was born in Mount Vernon , Washington , to parents Tim and Tina Oshie .

A scientific law or scientific principle is a concise verbal or mathematical statement of a relation that expresses a fundamental principle of science , like Newton 's law of universal gravitation . A scientific law must always apply under the same conditions , and implies a causal relationship between its elements . The law must be confirmed and broadly agreed upon through the process of inductive reasoning . As well , factual and well-confirmed statements like `` Mercury is liquid at standard temperature and pressure '' are considered to be too specific to qualify as scientific laws . A central problem in the philosophy of science , going back to David Hume , is that of distinguishing scientific laws from principles that arise merely accidentally because of the constant conjunction of one thing and another . A law differs from a scientific theory in that it does not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena : it is merely a distillation of the results of repeated observation . As such , a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed , and is often found to be false when extrapolated . Ohm 's law only applies to constant currents , Newton 's law of universal gravitation only applies in weak gravitational fields , the early laws of aerodynamics such as Bernoulli 's principle do not apply in case of compressible flow such as occurs in transonic and supersonic flight , Hooke 's law only applies to strain below the elastic limit , etc. The term `` scientific law '' is traditionally associated with the natural sciences , though the social sciences also contain scientific laws . Laws can become obsolete if they are found in contradiction with new data , as with Bode 's law or the biogenetic law .
Ulja is a village in Emmaste Parish , Hiiu County in northwestern Estonia .
Pig Latin is a language game of alterations played in English . To form the Pig Latin form of an English word the first consonant ( or consonant cluster ) is moved to the end of the word and an ay is affixed ( for example , pig yields ig-pay and computer yields omputer-cay ) . The purpose of the alteration is to both obfuscate the encoding and to indicate for the intended recipient the encoding as ` Pig Latin ' . The reference to Latin is a deliberate misnomer , as it is simply a form of jargon , used only for its English connotations as a ` strange and foreign-sounding language ' . The origins of Pig Latin are unknown . One early mention of the name was in Putnam 's Magazine in May 1869 : `` I had plenty of ammunition in reserve , to say nothing , Tom , of our pig Latin . ` Hoggibus , piggibus et shotam damnabile grunto ' , and all that sort of thing '' , although the language cited is not modern Pig Latin , but rather what would be called today Dog Latin . The Atlantic January 1895 also included a mention of the subject : `` They all spoke a queer jargon which they themselves had invented . It was something like the well-known ` pig Latin ' that all sorts of children like to play with '' . Thomas Jefferson wrote letters to friends in pig Latin . ( see Hailman in the references below ) Pig Latin is mostly used by people for amusement or to converse in perceived privacy from other persons . A few Pig Latin words , such as ixnay ( nix ) , amscray ( scram ) , and upidstay ( stupid ) , have been incorporated into American English slang . Transcription varies . A hyphen or apostrophe is sometimes used to facilitate translation back into English . Ayspray , for instance , is ambiguous , but ay-spray means `` spray '' whereas ays-pray means `` prays . '' In Bernese German , a variety of Pig Latin called Mattenenglisch was used in the Matte , the traditional working class neighborhood . Though it has fallen out of use since mid 20th century , it is still cultivated by voluntary associations . A characteristic of the Mattenenglisch Pig Latin is the complete substitution of the first vowel by i , in addition to the usual moving of the initial consonant cluster and the adding of ee . The Swedish equivalent of Pig Latin is AllsprÃ ket , which uses the same or similar rules but with the suffix '' - all '' . Additionally , the Swedish language game FikonsprÃ ket ( `` Fig language '' ) is similar to Pig Latin . In FikonsprÃ ket , speakers split each word after the first vowel , switch places of the two parts , put `` fi '' before the second part and `` kon '' after the first part . The word `` fimp '' , meaning cigarette stump , originated from FikonsprÃ ket ( `` stump '' = `` fimp stukon '' ) . French has the loucherbem ( or louchÃ bem ) coded language , which supposedly was originally used by butchers ( boucher in French ) . In loucherbem , the leading consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word ( as in Pig Latin ) and replaced by an l , and then a suffix is added at the end of the word ( - oche , - em , - oque , depending on the word ) . ex : fou ( crazy ) = loufoque . A similar coded language is largonji .
The 8th century is the period from 701 to 800 in accordance with the Julian calendar in the Christian\/Common Era . During this century , the Middle East , the coast of North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula rapidly come under Islamic Arab domination . The westward expansion of the Arab Empire is famously halted at the Siege of Constantinople by the Bulgarians and the Battle of Tours by the Franks . The tide of Arab conquest came to an end in the middle of the 8th century . Late in the century the Vikings , seafaring peoples from Scandinavia , begin raiding the coasts of Europe and the Mediterranean , and go on to found several important kingdoms . The Pala Empire is founded in Bengal . Chinese Emperor Xuanzong brings the Tang Dynasty to its pinnacle . Nara period in Japan .
In French cuisine , a quiche ( Ë kiË Ê ) is an oven-baked dish made with eggs and milk or cream in a pastry crust . Usually , the pastry shell is blind-baked before the other ingredients are added . Other ingredients such as cooked chopped meat , vegetables , or cheese are often added to the egg mixture before the quiche is baked . Quiche is generally an open pie ( i.e. it does not include a pastry covering ) , but may include an arrangement of tomato slices or pastry off-cuts for a decorative finish . Quiche may be eaten for breakfast , lunch , or dinner , depending on local customs and personal tastes . Although quiche is now a classic dish of French cuisine , the word quiche is from the German Kuchen , meaning cake . The Lorraine Franconian dialect of the German language is historically spoken in much of the region , where German Kuchen , `` cake '' , was first altered to `` kÃ 1\/4 che '' . Typical Alemannic changes unrounded the Ã 1\/4 and shifted the fricative `` ch '' to `` sh '' , resulting in `` kische '' , which in standard French orthography became spelled `` quiche . '' The precursor of `` quiche '' originated in the medieval kingdom of Lotharingia . Similar dishes existed in other countries ; savoury custards in pastry were known in English cuisine at least as early as the fourteenth century . Recipes for custards baked in pastry , including solid ingredients such as meat , fish and fruit baked in the custard , appear under titles such as Crustardes of flessh and Crustade , in The Forme of Cury and Harleian MSS 279 and 4016 . The well-known ` quiche Lorraine ' was an open pie with a filling consisting of an egg and cream custard , which is called `` migaine '' in Lorraine , with smoked bacon or lardons . It was only later that cheese was added to the quiche Lorraine . The addition of GruyÃ re cheese makes a quiche au gruyÃ re or a quiche vosgienne . The ` quiche alsacienne ' is similar to the ` quiche Lorraine ' , though onions are added to the recipe . The bottom crust was originally made from bread dough , but that has since evolved into a short-crust or puff pastry crust that is often baked using a Springform pan . Quiche became popular in England sometime after the Second World War , and in the U.S. during the 1950s . Today , one can find many varieties of quiche , from the original quiche Lorraine , to ones with broccoli , mushrooms , ham and\/or seafood ( primarily shellfish ) . Quiche can be served as an entrÃ e , for lunch , breakfast or an evening snack . To this day , there is a minor German influence on the cuisine of the Lorraine region . The origin of quiche Lorraine is rural and the original quiche Lorraine had a rustic flair : it was cooked in a cast-iron pan and the pastry edges were not crimped . Today , quiche Lorraine is served throughout France and has a modern look with a crimped pastry crust . Consumption of quiche Lorraine is most prevalent in the southern regions of France , where the warm climate lends itself to lighter fare . The current version of quiche Lorraine served in France does include cheese : either Emmental or GruyÃ re . Unlike the version served in the United States , the bacon is cubed , no onions are added and the custard base is thicker . Bruce Feirstein 's 1982 bestseller Real Men Do n't Eat Quiche humorously attempts to typecast quiche as a stereotypically feminine food in the context of American culture .
Weasels are mammals forming the genus Mustela of the Mustelidae family . They are small , active predators , long and slender with short legs . Weasels vary in length from 12 t , and usually have a red or brown upper coat and a white belly ; some populations of some species moult to a wholly white coat in winter . They have long slender bodies , which enable them to follow their prey into burrows . Their tails may be from 22 t long . As is typical of small omnivores , weasels have a reputation for cleverness and guile . Weasels feed on small mammals , and have from time to time been considered vermin since some species took poultry from farms , or rabbits from commercial warrens . Certain species of weasel and ferrets have been reported to perform the mesmerizing weasel war dance , after fighting other creatures , or acquiring food from competing creatures . In folklore at least , this dance is particularly associated with the stoat . Weasels occur all across the world except for Antarctica , Australia , and neighbouring islands . The English word `` weasel '' was originally applied to one species of the genus , the European form of the Least Weasel ( Mustela nivalis ) . This usage is retained in British English , where the name is also extended to cover several other small species of the genus . It is thought that the name `` weasel '' comes from the Anglo-Saxon root `` weatsop '' meaning `` a vicious bloodthirsty animal '' . However , in technical discourse and in American usage the term `` weasel '' can refer to any member of the genus , or to the genus as a whole . Of the 17 extant species currently classified in the genus Mustela , ten have `` weasel '' in their common name . Among those that do not are the stoat or ermine , the polecats , the ferret , and the European Mink ( the superficially similar American Mink is now regarded as belonging in another genus , Neovison ) . Collective nouns for a group of weasels include boogle , gang , pack , sneak and confusion . The following information is according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System . 1 Europe & Northern Asia division excludes China . The extinct `` Sea mink '' was commonly included in this genus as Mustela macrodon , but in 1999 was moved to the genus Neovison .
The Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School , also known as PA Cyber , is a public virtual charter school based out of Midland , Pennsylvania . Enrollment is open to Pennsylvania students in grades PreK-12 . When the steel mill in Midland , PA closed , a period of decline and population erosion began . In 1986 , the Midland High School was closed . The former Midland High School students were sent to neighboring school districts . In order to give these students another option , community and school board members took advantage of Pennsylvania 's 1997 charter school law to start PA Cyber . More than 500 students enrolled in the school . The first graduating class had only 17 students . PA Cyber now employs nearly 600 people and has regional offices in Philadelphia , Wexford and Harrisburg . PA Cyber is currently the largest and most successful of Pennsylvania 's 11 cyber charter schools . The school has grown from just a few hundred students to over 12,000 in just 10 years . Students can take either real-time ( virtual classsroom ) classes or self-paced classes . In a virtual course , students have class several times every week with a VC teacher . Students can interact with their classmates and the teacher via audio , video , keyboard or a digital tablet with drawing and writing tools . Students attend virtual classes through Elluminate , which allows students to view playbacks of classes they missed . Teachers can also post recorded classes , if they are unable to teach class for the day . Students can also access more than one class at a time . In order to access Elluminate , students must have Java downloaded on their computer . In a self-paced class , students complete coursework through Calvert , Lincoln Interactive and Little Lincoln . If needed , students can contact their teachers for assistance . Students use learner management systems and content delivery systems to access classes , submit work , check grades and check announcements from the school . PA Cyber students have access to a variety of classes in several categories . Students are required to take certain courses for each grade level . In addition to regular courses such as English , social studies and math , students can enroll in courses about computers , home economics and world languages . Pennsylvania school law allows students in cyber charter schools to participate in athletics and other extracurricular activities in their home districts . For instance , three different PA Cyber students have been state champion high school wrestlers . Since PA Cyber is a public school , any student who resides in the state of Pennsylvania is allowed to enroll at no cost . Students are given computers , printers , textbooks , calculators , school calendars , email accounts and all materials needed to complete coursework . PA Cyber pays for the student 's internet connection . The student 's home school district pays tuition to the cyber school . By legislative formula , home districts pay about 75 percent of what it costs them to educate students in the classroom . They also are reimbursed by the state about 30 percent of the tuition they pay to either brick-and-mortar charters or cyber charter schools . The schools websites can occasionally go down , inhibiting the ability to access courses . This can also happen during assignments which can cause a student to lose the work , or be graded zero . The same technological dependencies hold true in every online-based school . PA Cyber has not lost a day of instructional time in over four years . Pa Cyber has announced that they will change to Elluminate , starting at the beginning of the 2010-2011 school year . This should resolve most of the tech problems that AT&T Connect has been unable to fix .
Pectinase is a general term for enzymes , such as pectolyase , pectozyme and polygalacturonase , commonly referred to in brewing as pectic enzymes . These break down pectin , a polysaccharide substrate that is found in the cell walls of plants . One of the most studied and widely used commercial pectinases is polygalacturonase . It is useful because pectin is the jelly-like matrix which helps cement plant cells together and in which other cell wall components , such as cellulose fibrils , are embedded . Therefore pectinase enzymes are commonly used in processes involving the degradation of plant materials , such as speeding up the extraction of fruit juice from fruit , including apples and sapota . Pectinases have also been used in wine production since the 1960s . The function of Pectinase in brewing is twofold , first it helps breakdown the plant ( typically fruit ) material and so helps the extraction of flavors from the mash . Secondly the presence of pectin in finished wine causes a haze or slight cloudiness , Pectinase is used to break this down and so clear the wine . They can be extracted from fungi such as Aspergillus niger . The fungus produces these enzymes to break down the middle lamella in plants so that it can extract nutrients from the plant tissues and insert fungal hyphae . If pectinase is boiled it is denatured ( unfolded ) making it harder to connect with the pectin at the active site , and produce as much juice . Pectinases are also used for retting . Addition of chelating agents or pretreatment of the plant material with acid enhance the effect of the enzyme . As they are enzymes , pectinases have an optimum temperature and pH at which they are most active . For example , a commercial pectinase might typically be activated at 45 to 55 Â C and work well at a pH of 4.5 to 5.5 .

A maggot is the larva of a fly ( order Diptera ) . Anglers use maggots usually provided by commercial suppliers to catch non-predatory fish . Maggots are the most popular bait for anglers in Europe . Anglers throw handfuls into the `` swim '' they are targeting , attracting the fish to the area . The angler will then use the largest or `` perceived '' most attractive maggots on the hook , hoping to be irresistible to the fish . Commercial maggot breeders from the UK sell their maggots to tackle dealers throughout the E.U. and North America . In North America , maggots have been used for years mainly as ice fishing bait ; recently , however , anglers have started using them year round . Certain live maggots have been employed since antiquity as an economical , safe and effective type of wound debridement . In controlled and sterile settings by licensed medical practitioners , maggot therapy introduces live , disinfected maggots into non-healing skin or soft wounds of a human or other animal . They eat the dead old tissue , leaving the live tissue alone . It is uncertain if maggot secretions have any effect on bacterial growth , since different studies have produced contradictory results , and some species of bacteria may be naturally resistant to maggot secretions . As of 2008 , maggot therapy was being used in around 1,000 medical centers in Europe and over 800 medical centers in the United States . As with fleas and ticks , maggots can be a threat to household pets and livestock , especially sheep . Flies reproduce rapidly in the summer months and maggots can come in large numbers , creating a maggot infestation and a high risk of myiasis in sheep and other animals . Humans are not immune to the feeding habits of maggots and can also contract myiasis . Interaction between humans and maggots usually occurs near garbage cans , dead animals , rotten food and other breeding grounds for maggots . It may take 8 -- 20 hours for maggots to grow . A major problem also arises when maggots turn into flies and start the life cycle over again . Within a few generations the number of maggots grows exponentially and becomes a serious problem . Professionals can remove maggots or many over-the-counter bug sprays can be used to deter flies and maggots . Keeping garbage in a sealed container and using a garbage disposal or freezing rotting leftovers until waste collection day helps prevent infestation . Sometimes introducing an environmental control , such as Histeridae , also help reduce maggot populations .

The Detroit News is one of the two major newspapers in the U.S. city of Detroit , Michigan . The paper began in 1873 , when it rented space in the rival Free Press 's building . The News absorbed the Detroit Tribune on February 1 , 1919 , the Detroit Journal on July 21 , 1922 , and on November 7 , 1960 , it bought and closed the faltering Detroit Times . However , it retained the Times building which it used as a printing plant until 1967 when a new facility opened in Sterling Heights and it was demolished . The street in downtown Detroit where the Times building once stood is still called `` Times Square . '' The Evening News Association , owner of The News , merged with Gannett in 1985 . The News claims to have been the first newspaper in the world to operate a radio station , station 8MK , which went on the air August 20 , 1920 . 8MK is now WWJ . In 1947 , it established Michigan 's first television station , WWJ-TV , now WDIV-TV . In 1989 , the paper entered into a 100-year joint operating agreement with the rival Free Press , combining business operations while keeping separate editorial staffs . The combined company is called the Detroit Newspaper Partnership . The Free Press moved into The News building in 1998 and until May 7 , 2006 , the two published a single joint weekend edition . Today The News , which has won three Pulitzer Prizes , is published Monday-Saturday , and has an editorial page in the Sunday Free Press . The Detroit News was founded by James E. Scripps who , in turn , was the older half-brother and one-time partner of Edward W. Scripps . The paper 's eventual success , however , is largely credited to Scripps ' son-in-law , George Gough Booth , who came aboard at the request of his wife 's father . Booth went on to construct Michigan 's largest newspaper empire , founding the independent Booth Newspapers chain ( now owned by S.I. Newhouse 's Advance Publications ) with his two brothers . The Detroit News building was erected in 1917 . It was designed by architect Albert Kahn , who included a faux-stone concrete building with large street level arches to admit light . The arches along the east and south side of the building were bricked-in for protection after the 12th Street Riot in 1967 . The bricked-in arches on the east and south ends of the building were reopened during renovations required when the Free Press relocated its offices there 20 years later . In 1931 The Detroit News made history when it bought a three place Pitcairn PCA-2 auto-gyro as a camera aircraft which could take off and land in restrict places and semi-hover for photos . It was the ancestor of today 's well known news helicopter . On July 13 , 1995 , Newspaper Guild employees of the Detroit Free Press and The News along with pressmen , printers and Teamsters , working for the `` Detroit Newspapers '' distribution arm , went on strike . Approximately half of the staffers crossed the picket line before the unions ended their strike in February 1997 . The strike was resolved in court three years later , with the journalists ' union losing its unfair labor practices case on appeal . Still , the weakened unions remain active at the paper , representing a majority of the employees under their jurisdiction . On August 3 , 2005 , Gannett announced that it was selling The News to MediaNews Group and purchasing the Free Press from the Knight Ridder company . With this move , Gannett became the managing partner in the papers ' joint operating agreement . On May 7 , 2006 , the combined Sunday Detroit News and Free Press were replaced by a stand-alone Sunday Free Press . On December 16 , 2008 , Detroit Media Partnership announced a plan to limit weekday home delivery for both dailies to Thursday and Friday only . On other weekdays the paper sold at newsstands would be smaller , about 32 pages , and redesigned . This arrangement went into effect on March 30 , 2009 . The News has significantly lower print circulation than the Free Press ( over 100,000 fewer copies , according the Knight Ridder 2004 Annual Report ) though The News website is the 10th most-read newspaper website in the United States . Editorially , The News is considered to be somewhat more conservative than the Free Press . However , it considers itself to be libertarian . In an editorial statement printed in 1958 , The News described itself as consistently conservative on economic issues and consistently liberal on civil liberties issues . It has never endorsed a Democrat for president , and has only failed to endorse a Republican presidential candidate three timesâ '' twice during the Franklin D. Roosevelt era and once again in 2004 , when it refused to endorse George W. Bush for reelection .
Rickets is a softening of bones in children due to deficiency or impaired metabolism of vitamin D , phosphorus or calcium , potentially leading to fractures and deformity . Rickets is among the most frequent childhood diseases in many developing countries . The predominant cause is a vitamin D deficiency , but lack of adequate calcium in the diet may also lead to rickets ( cases of severe diarrhea and vomiting may be the cause of the deficiency ) . Although it can occur in adults , the majority of cases occur in children suffering from severe malnutrition , usually resulting from famine or starvation during the early stages of childhood . Osteomalacia is the term used to describe a similar condition occurring in adults , generally due to a deficiency of vitamin D. The origin of the word `` rickets '' is probably from the Old English dialect word ` wrickken ' , to twist . The Greek derived word `` rachitis '' ( Ï Î Ï Î Ï Î Ï , meaning `` inflammation of the spine '' ) was later adopted as the scientific term for rickets , due chiefly to the words ' similarity in sound . An X-ray or radiograph of an advanced sufferer from rickets tends to present in a classic way : bow legs ( outward curve of long bone of the legs ) and a deformed chest . Changes in the skull also occur causing a distinctive `` square headed '' appearance . These deformities persist into adult life if not treated . Long-term consequences include permanent bends or disfiguration of the long bones , and a curved back . The primary cause of rickets is a vitamin D deficiency . Vitamin D is required for proper calcium absorption from the gut . Sunlight , especially ultraviolet light , lets human skin cells convert Vitamin D from an inactive to active state . In the absence of vitamin D , dietary calcium is not properly absorbed , resulting in hypocalcemia , leading to skeletal and dental deformities and neuromuscular symptoms , e.g. hyperexcitability . Foods that contain vitamin D include butter , eggs , fish liver oils , margarine , fortified milk and juice , and oily fishes such as tuna , herring , and salmon . A rare X-linked dominant form exists called Vitamin D resistant rickets . Cases have been reported in Britain in recent years of rickets in children of many social backgrounds caused by inability to make vitamin D because the sun 's ultravoilet light was not reaching the skin because of persistent use of strong sunblock , or too much `` covering up '' in sunlight , or spending too much time indoors ; the British Medical Journal reported in 2010 that doctors in Newcastle on Tyne saw 20 cases of rickets per year . The treatment and prevention of rickets is known as antirachitic . Treatment involves increasing dietary intake of calcium , phosphates and vitamin D. Exposure to ultraviolet B light ( sunshine when the sun is highest in the sky ) , cod liver oil , halibut-liver oil , and viosterol are all sources of vitamin D. A sufficient amount of ultraviolet B light in sunlight each day and adequate supplies of calcium and phosphorus in the diet can prevent rickets . Darker-skinned babies need to be exposed longer to the ultraviolet rays . The replacement of vitamin D has been proven to correct rickets using these methods of ultraviolet light therapy and medicine . Recommendations are for 400 international units ( IU ) of vitamin D a day for infants and children . Children who do not get adequate amounts of vitamin D are at increased risk of rickets . Vitamin D is essential for allowing the body to uptake calcium for use in proper bone calcification and maintenance . Sufficient vitamin D levels can also be achieved through dietary supplementation and\/or exposure to sunlight . Vitamin D3 ( cholecalciferol ) is the preferred form since it is more readily absorbed than vitamin D2 . Most dermatologists recommend vitamin D supplementation as an alternative to unprotected ultraviolet exposure due to the increased risk of skin cancer associated with sun exposure . Endogenous production with full body exposure to sunlight is approximately 250 Â g ( 10,000 IU ) per day . According to the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) , infants who are breast-fed may not get enough vitamin D from breast milk alone . For this reason , the AAP recommends that infants who are exclusively breast-fed receive daily supplements of vitamin D from age 2 months until they start drinking at least 17 ounces of vitamin D-fortified milk or formula a day . In developed countries , rickets is a rare disease ( incidence of less than 1 in 200,000 ) . Individuals with red hair have been speculated to have a decreased risk for rickets due to their greater production of vitamin D in sunlight . Children ages 6 months to 24 months are at highest risk , because their bones are rapidly growing . Long-term consequences include permanent bends or disfiguration of the long bones , and a curved back . Rickets vs. abuse : a national and international epidemic Kathy A. Keller & Patrick D.

Larkhall ; ( Gaelic : Taigh na h-Uiseig ) is a town in South Lanarkshire , Scotland and is around 14 m southeast of Glasgow . It is twinned with Seclin in northern France . The name Larkhall or Laverock ` Ha first appears in journals around 1620 . The origins of the name are unknown , although Laverock is the Scots word for skylark . However , there is no evidence that the town is named after the bird . It is more likely that Laverock was a surname . Larkhall sits on high ground between the River Clyde to the East and the Avon Water to the West . Larkhall sits on the edge of the scenic Clyde valley and is a commuter town for Glasgow . Larkhall had a population of 15,549 in the 2001 census , and is a typical west of Scotland industrial town .

The black lady of Larkhall was the wife of Captain McNeil , then owner of Broomhill House . She was brought to Larkhall by Captain McNeil after one of his many seafaring voyages . She was happy with her new life but her ignorance of Scottish customs made her a social outcast . The Captain forbade her to leave Broomhill House during the day . Soon she was not seen at night either and the Captain claimed she had disappeared , but locals were suspicious . She soon returned , as her ghostly form appeared in the windows of Broomhill House and then later in Morgan Glen . It is not known if she ever got her revenge on the Captain but he did die prematurely . When Broomhill House fell into disrepair the five hundredweight door lintel was moved to The Applebank Public House by five men . The next day it was found lying across the road from the public house . In the 1960s a team from the `` Tonight '' program visited Larkhall as they tried to perform the first televised exorcism . The cameras were frozen over in fine weather and after filming finished the director was killed in a road crash on his way to another location . He was found with a fence post impaled in his heart . One of the town 's most notable landmarks is the Morgan Glen viaduct standing over the Avon Water . At 170ft , it is the tallest viaduct in Scotland .

These are lists of active and all-time National Hockey League ( NHL ) franchise post-season appearance , post-season series win , Stanley Cup Final and Stanley Cup streaks up to and including the 2009 â `` 10 NHL season and subsequent 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs . These lists do not include the canceled 2004 â `` 05 NHL season . A post-season appearance streak is continued by making the NHL playoffs after the regular season . Since the first round of the playoffs consists of 8 series , there will always be 16 teams in this list ( of the 30 teams in the NHL ) . Note that the Detroit Red Wings ' current 19-season streak of making the post-season is the longest active streak of any of the four major professional sports leagues ( NHL , NFL , NBA , MLB ) . This is a list of teams that have active post-season series win streaks . A post-season series win streak is continued by making the post-season and winning at least the first round series of the playoffs . Since the first round of the playoffs consists of 8 series , there will always be 8 teams in this list . 1 The Montreal Canadiens only missed the playoffs once between the 1948 â `` 49 and 1993 â `` 94 seasons . In the 1969 â `` 70 season , they tied for fourth and last playoff spot with the New York Rangers , but were eliminated on total goals scored tiebreak ( they scored 244 goals to New York 's 246 ) . If they had made the playoffs that season , they would have had a post-season appearance streak of 46 seasons . 2 Includes 5 seasons as the Atlanta Flames ( 1975 â `` 76 through 1979 â `` 80 ) , and 11 seasons as the Calgary Flames ( 1980 â `` 81 through 1990 â `` 91 ) 3 The Edmonton Oilers made the playoffs the first year they were in the NHL ( 1979 â `` 80 ) ; although they are n't included in the NHL streak , they made the WHA playoffs the preceding 4 seasons ( 1975 â `` 76 through 1978 â `` 79 ) 4 Includes 1 season as the Quebec Nordiques ( 1994 â `` 95 ) , and 10 seasons as the Colorado Avalanche ( 1995 â `` 96 through 2005 â `` 06 ) 1 Not the current Ottawa franchise . This franchise , an original member of the NHL , folded following the 1934 â `` 35 NHL season after playing one year in St. Louis as the Eagles .
Cellular respiration describes the metabolism reactions and processes that take place in a cell to obtain biochemical energy from fuel molecules and the release of the cells ' waste products . Energy is released by the oxidation of fuel molecules and is stored as `` high-energy '' carriers . The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions in metabolism .

The spring scale apparatus is simply a spring fixed at one end with a hook to attach an object at the other . It works by Hooke 's Law , which states that the force needed to extend a spring is proportional to the distance that spring is extended from its rest position . Therefore the scale markings on the spring scale are equally spaced . Spring scales can be calibrated for the accurate measurement of mass in the location in which they are used , but many spring scales are marked right on their face `` Not Legal for Trade '' or words of similar import , due to the approximate nature of the theory used to mark the scale . Also , the spring in the scale can permanently stretch with repeated use . If two spring scales are hung one below the other in series , each of the scales will read the weight of the body hung on the lower scale . The scale on top would read slightly heavier due to being stretched by the weight of the lower scale . Spring scales come in different sizes . Generally , small scales that measure newtons will have a less firm spring ( one with a smaller spring constant ) than larger ones that measure tens , hundreds or thousands of newtons . Spring scales can be used in physics and education as basic accelerometers , but its main uses are industrial , especially related to weighing heavy loads such as trucks , storage silos , and material carried on a conveyor belt . Spring scales are used when the high accuracy afforded by other types of scales can be sacrificed for simplicity , cheapness , and robustness . The first spring balance in Britain was made around 1770 by Richard Salter of West Bromwich . He and his nephews John & George founded the firm of George Salter & Co. , still notable makers of scales and balances , who in 1838 patented the spring balance . They also applied the same spring balance principle to steam locomotive safety valves , replacing the earlier deadweight valves .

The Tierpark Hagenbeck is a zoo in Stellingen , now a quarter in Hamburg , Germany . The collection began in 1863 with animals that belonged to Carl Hagenbeck Sr. ( 1810 â `` 87 ) , a fishmonger who became an amateur animal collector . The park itself was founded by Carl Hagenbeck Jr. in 1907 . It is known for being the first zoo to use open enclosures surrounded by moats , rather than barred cages , to better approximate animals ' natural environments . In 1863 the elder Hagenbeck began collecting exotic animals that came through the port . By the 1870s , the trade had proved more lucrative than his fish shop , and Hagenbeck had become one of the most prominent exotic animal traders in all of Europe . In 1874 , the younger Hagenbeck traveled around the world collecting animals . Among his collections , however , were also human beings which he exhibited in `` human zoos '' . Hagenbeck decided to exhibit Samoan and Sami people ( Laplanders ) as `` purely natural '' populations . The Sami were presented with their tents , weapons , and sleds , beside a group of reindeer . In 1874 , Hagenbeck opened a zoo facility in Hamburg , called Carl Hagenbeck 's Thierpark , while he continued exhibiting humans . In 1876 , he began exhibiting Nubians all across Europe . He also dispatched an agent to Labrador to secure a number of `` Esquimaux '' ( Inuit ) from the settlement of Hopedale ; these Inuit ( see Abraham Ulrikab ) were exhibited in the Hamburg Tierpark . Though initially popular , Hagenbeck 's shows gradually began to decline in popularity , especially once the photograph became more and more common , and Hagenbeck 's exhibits began to look less and less real in comparison . After one exhibit , Hagenbeck was left with a large number of elephants and no one to purchase them . Unable to sell , he started a circus . To counter the declining popularity of his human zoos , Hagenbeck began working on making his displays more realistic , techniques that would later influence the animal zoo . In the 1890s Hagenbeck created his first `` panorama '' exhibit and patented the idea in 1896 . The display was the `` Northern Panorama '' , the foreground featured seals and walruses in a pool . Hidden to the zoos patrons was a moat behind the pool . Beyond the moat were reindeer , and beyond a second hidden moat were polar bears . By hiding the moats , the animals appeared to be together in one landscape . In 1907 , Hagenbeck constructed a new facility outside of Hamburg which he called Tierpark Hagenbeck ( without the ` H ' that was in Thierpark ) which is still the location of the facility today . Hagenbeck sought to design the entire zoo with his panorama system . He also sought to demonstrate that animals from warmer climates did not need to live in expensive , humid , foreboding buildings . Instead , Hagenbeck again sought to make his displays realistic . Using data that he had compiled running his circus , Hagenbeck had estimates of how high and far different animals could leap . Using this data , he built moats filled with water or an empty pit that he determined the animals could not cross . Using moats to separate animals that did not swim , one could look across an expanse of the zoo and see many animals at once , as if in the wild . Previously , zoos had ` not ' grouped animal by species , but Hagenbeck revolutionized the layout of zoos , grouping his animals by species . Hagenbeck 's design was a popular success . In 1911 , Hagenbeck designed the Rome Zoo in the same style . In 1913 , he designed the first monkey-rock exhibit , in this case an artificial crag with a 16 f moat . The rock was populated by around 200 Hamadryas baboons . Hagenbeck called his design an animal paradise where `` animals would live beside each other in harmony and where the fight for survival would be eliminated . '' Hagenbeck died in 1913 , but his zoo remained popular until the political situation in Europe swept the zoo into hard times . During World War I many of the keepers were drafted into the German army . After the war , the zoo closed for two years as Germany entered into a deep depression . Then during the Bombing of Hamburg in World War II the original zoo was destroyed . After the war the zoo was rebuilt . The private zoo is still run by the Hagenbeck family . In July 1956 , forty five rhesus monkeys escaped from the zoo and ran wild in Hamburg . The incident resulted in calls for help from shocked housewives who met monkeys in their bedrooms and bathtubs . Some of the monkeys sat in trees and chattered excitedly , showing each other toothpaste , soap bars and bathroom utensils which they had grabbed . Managers of the Zoo reported that more than two dozen of the long-tailed Indian monkeys had been caught by policemen , firemen , zoo keepers and schoolchildren .

The National Assembly is the lower house of the bicameral Parliament of Pakistan . The Speaker of the House presides over the Assembly , and acts as the president of the country if both the President and the Chairman of the Senate are not present . The leader of the largest party in the Assembly often serves as the Prime Minister of Pakistan . Currently , Dr. Fahmida Mirza of Pakistan Peoples Party is serving as Speaker and Faisal Kareem Kundi as Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan and Nisar Ali Khan of Pakistan Muslim League ( N ) is serving as an opposition leader of the house . The composition of the National Assembly is specified in Article 51 of the Constitution of Pakistan . There are a total of 342 seats in the National Assembly . Of these , 272 are filled by direct elections . In addition , the Pakistani Constitution reserves 10 seats for religious minorities and 60 seats for women , to be filled by proportional representation among parties with more than 5 % of the vote . As of 2006 , there are 72 women members in the Assembly . Members of the National Assembly are elected by the people in competitive multi-party elections , to be held at most five years apart . According to Article 62 of the Constitution , candidates must be citizens of Pakistan and not less than eighteen years of age . National Assembly can be disolved at the initiative of the Prime Minister . If dissolved , new elections are conducted for the Assembly . Article 58 of the Constitution of Pakistan deals with the dissolution of the Assembly : ( 1 ) The President shall dissolve the National Assembly if so advised by the Prime Minister ; and the National Assembly shall , unless sooner dissolved , stand dissolved at the expiration of forty-eight hours after the Prime Minister has so advised . : ( a ) a vote of no-confidence having been passed against the Prime Minister , no other member of the National Assembly is likely to command the confidence of the majority of the members of the National Assembly in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution as ascertained in a session of the National Assembly summoned for the purpose ; or : ( b ) a situation has arisen in which the Government of the Federation can not be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and an appeal to the electorate is necessary .

The Tasman Bridge is a five-lane bridge crossing the Derwent River , near the CBD of Hobart , Tasmania . The bridge has a total length ( including approaches ) of 1,395 metres ( 4,576 ft ) . It provides the main traffic route from the CBD ( on the western shore ) to the eastern shore - particularly Hobart International Airport and Bellerive Oval . It has a pedestrian foot way on each side , but no dedicated lane for bicycles . However , steps to the pedestrian foot way have recently been replaced with on-ramps . In the 1950s with the development of the Eastern shore , it was decided to build a larger bridge ; the old Hobart Bridge faced increasing difficulty in managing the larger volumes of traffic that came with development , and constantly raising the lift span for shipping was disruptive . The total cost of the new bridge in conjunction with approach ramps and Lindisfarne Interchange was in the area of Â # 7 million . Construction commenced in May 1960 and the bridge was first opened to traffic ( 2 lanes only ) on 18 August 1964 . The bridge was completed with all four lanes operational on 23 December 1964 . It was officially opened on 18 March 1965 by H. R. H. Prince Richard , The Duke of Gloucester . During peak construction a labor force of over 400 men was employed on site . On Sunday 5 January 1975 , at 9:27 p.m. Australian Eastern Summer Time , the Tasman Bridge was struck by the bulk ore carrier Lake Illawarra , bound for the Electrolytic Zinc Company with a cargo of 10,000 tons of zinc concentrate . It caused two pylons and three sections of concrete decking , totaling 127 metres ( 417 ft ) , to fall from the bridge and sink the ship . Seven of the ship 's crewmen were killed , and five motorists died when four cars drove over the collapsed sections before the traffic was stopped . A major press shot showed a 3,000 km old Holden Monaro GTS , which was owned by Frank and Sylvia Maley , along with an older EK Holden station wagon , driven by a local man Mr. Murray Ling , perched balancing on the ledge . The depth of the river at this point ( 35 metres ( 115 ft ) is such that the wreck of Lake Illawarra still lies on the bottom , with concrete slab on top of it , without presenting a navigation hazard to smaller vessels . The breakage of an important arterial link isolated the residents in Hobartâ s eastern suburbs â `` the relatively short drive across the Tasman Bridge to the city suddenly became a 50 kilometre ( 31 mi ) journey via the estuary 's next bridge at Bridgewater . The only other vehicular crossing within Hobart after the bridge collapsed was the Risdon Punt , a cable ferry which crossed the river from East Risdon and Risdon , some five kilometres upstream from the bridge . However , it was totally inadequate , carrying only eight cars on each crossing , and although ferries provided a service across the Derwent River , it was not until December 1975 that a two lane , 788m long Bailey bridge was opened to traffic , thereby restoring some connectivity . The separation of Hobart saw an immediate surge in the small and limited ferry service then operating across the river . In a primary position to provide a service were the two ships of Robert Clifford , a Tasmanian mariner . He had introduced the locally-built ferries Matthew Brady and James McCabe to the river crossing , from the Central Business District of Hobart to the eastern shore , shortly before the collision . These two ships were soon joined by the Cartela , a wooden vessel of 1912 vintage , and other ships , including Sydney Harbour ferries , pressed into service by the Tasmanian Government , to ferry thousands of commuters across the river . Following successful rebuilding of the Bridge , Clifford 's organization saw the ferry traffic fade quickly , but by then he had diversified into further building of ships . . On the 20 June 2007 , a crane toppled whilst carrying out works on the bridge , and precariously hung for a number of hours off the side of the barriers . Reconstruction of the Tasman Bridge commenced in October 1975 . An important factor of the reconstruction is the improved safety measures . Some examples : On top of the new safety measures implemented , the bridge was further upgraded to hold a fifth lane . This upgrade included the construction of a lane management system which would enable the new middle lane to function as a reversible lane . The system consists of a traffic light system and a sign above each lane , pictured right . The signs , in conjunction with the traffic light system , employ a pulley system to periodically pull the signs over their appropriate lanes . The middle lane points towards the city side ( or western shore ) during a.m. peak hours and points back towards the eastern shore during p.m. peak hours . The lane generally points towards the eastern shore during non-peak hours . The Tasman Bridge repair took two years and cost approximately $ 44 million . The bridge officially reopened on 8 October 1977 .

Soft rock is a style of music which uses the techniques of rock music ( often combined with elements from folk rock and singer-songwriter pop ) to compose a softer , more toned-down sound . Soft rock songs generally tend to focus on themes like love , everyday life and relationships . The genre tends to make heavy use of acoustic guitars , pianos , synthesizers and sometimes saxophones . The electric guitars in soft rock are normally faint and high-pitched . From the late 1960s it became common to divide mainstream rock music into soft and hard rock , with both emerging as major radio formats in the US . Soft rock was often derived from folk rock , using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies . Major artists included Carole King , Cat Stevens and James Taylor . It reached its commercial peak in the mid - to late 70s with acts like Billy Joel , Chicago , America and the reformed Fleetwood Mac , whose Rumours ( 1977 ) was the best-selling album of the decade . By 1977 , some radio stations , like New York 's WTFM and WYNY , had switched to an all-soft-rock format . By the 1980s , tastes had changed and radio formats reflected this change , including musical artists such as Journey . The genre evolved into what came to be known as `` adult contemporary '' or `` easy listening , '' a categorization that bore less overt rock influence than its forebear .
Teasing is a word with many meanings . In human interactions , teasing comes in two major forms , playful and hurtful . When teasing is playful and friendly , and especially when it is reciprocal , teasing can be regarded as flirting . People may be teased on such matters as their appearance , weight , behavior , abilities , and clothing . From the victim 's point-of-view , this kind of teasing is often hurtful , irrespective of the intention of the teaser . When teasing is unwelcome , it may be regarded as harassment or mobbing , especially in the work place , or as a form of bullying or emotional abuse . If done in public , it may be regarded as humiliation . One may also tease an animal . Some animals , such as dogs and cats , may recognize this as play . The most common form of teasing is verbal bullying or taunting . This behavior is intended to distract , irritate , or annoy the recipient . Because it is hurtful , it is different from painful sexual abuse joking and is generally accompanied by some degree of social rejection . Teasing can also be taken to mean `` To make fun of ; mock playfully '' . For example , Michael teasing Deanna does n't mean he 's bullying her . One form of teasing is to pretend to give something which the other desires , or giving it very slowly . This is usually done by arousing curiosity or desire and may not actually involve the intent to satisfy or disclose . This form of teasing could be called `` tantalizing '' , after the story of Tantalus . It is generally playful among adults , although among children it can be hurtful , such as when one child acquires a possession of another 's property and will not return it . It is also common in flirting and dating . For example , a man or woman who is interested in someone might rebuff an advance the first time in order to arouse interest and curiosity , and acquiesce the second or third time . Whether teasing is playful or hurtful , is largely subject to the interpretation of the person being teased . If the person being teased feels harmed , then the teasing is hurtful . A difference in power between people may also make the behavior hurtful rather than playful . Ultimately though , if someone perceives him or herself as the victim of teasing , and experiences the teasing as unpleasant , then it is considered hurtful . If the other person continues to do it after being asked to stop , then it is a form of bullying or abuse . Another way to look at teasing is an honest reflection on differences , expressed in a joking fashion with the goal of `` clearing the air '' . It can express a comfort with the other which can be comforting . As opposed to being nice to someones face while making disparaging remarks behind their back , teasing can be a way to express differences in a direct fashion rather than internalizing them . To tease , or to `` be a tease '' in a sexual sense , can refer to the use of posture , language or other means of flirting to cause another person to become sexually aroused . Such teasing may or may not be a prelude to intercourse , an ambiguity which can lead to uncomfortable situations . In a more physical sense , it can also refer to sexual stimulation . Teasing is also used to describe playing part of a song at a concert . Jam bands will often quote the main riff of another song during jams . When Phish guitar player Trey Anastasio would play the opening line of The Simpsons theme song , the audience would yell `` D'oh ! '' in response . Jimi Hendrix 's song `` Third Stone from the Sun '' was teased in The Allman Brothers ' song `` Mountain Jam '' on their album Eat a Peach , and was often used by Jaco Pastorius in his song `` Slang '' . `` Tease it '' is also used as a slang term to smoke marijuana . The word `` tease '' can also be used as a noun to stand for marijuana . In a very different context , hair can be teased , `` ratted '' , or more correctly , `` backcombed '' . As the name suggests , backcombing involves combing the hair backwards from end to root to intentionally tangle the strands to create volume . It can also be done excessively in sections to create dreadlocks .

A blimp , or non-rigid airship , is an airship without an internal supporting framework or keel . A non-rigid airship differs from a semi-rigid airship and a rigid airship ( e.g. , a Zeppelin ) in that it does not have any rigid structure , neither a complete framework nor a partial keel , to help the airbag maintain its shape . Rather , these aircraft rely on both a higher pressure of the lifting gas ( usually helium ) inside the envelope and the strength of the envelope itself . The term `` blimp '' refers only to free-flying aircraft . The term is sometimes erroneously used to refer to the tethered craft known as moored balloons . While often very similar in shape , moored balloons have no propulsion and are tethered to the ground . Since blimps keep their shape with internal overpressure , typically the only solid parts are the passenger car ( gondola ) and the tail fins . A non-rigid airship that uses heated air instead of a light gas ( such as helium ) as a lifting medium is called a hot-air airship . Volume changes of the lifting gas , due to temperature changes , is balanced using ballonets ( air bags ) , in order to maintain the overpressure . Without sufficient overpressure , the blimp loses its ability to be steered and top speed is degraded . The propeller air stream can be used to inflate the hull . In some models , such as the Skyship 600 , differential ballonet inflation can provide a measure of pitch trim control . The engines driving the propellers are usually directly attached to the gondola , and in some models are partly steerable . Blimps are the most commonly built airships , because they are relatively easy to build and easy to transport once deflated . However , because of their unstable hull , their size is limited . A blimp with too long a hull may kink in the middle when the overpressure is insufficient or when maneuvered too fast ( this has also happened with semi-rigid airships with weak keels ) . This led to the development of semi-rigids and rigid airships . Modern blimps launch somewhat heavier than air ( overweight ) , in contrast to historic blimps . The missing lift is provided by lifting the nose and using engine power . Some types also use steerable propellers or ducted fans . Operating in a state heavier than air avoids the need to dump ballast at lift-off and also avoids the need to lose costly lifting gas on landing . The term `` blimp '' is reportedly onomatopoeic , the sound the airship makes when one taps the envelope ( balloon ) with a finger . Although there is some disagreement among historians , credit for coining the term is usually given to Lt. A.D. Conningham of the British Royal Navy in 1915 . A 1943 etymology published in the New York Times confirms the British origin during the First World War when the British were experimenting with lighter-than-air craft . The initial non-rigid aircraft was called the A-limp ; and a second version called the B-limp was deemed more satisfactory . An oft-repeated , but false , alternative explanation for the term says that at some time in the early 20th century , the United States military had two classes for airships : Type A-rigid and Type B-limp ( hence `` blimp '' ) . In fact , The perpetuation of this erroneous explanation is an example of false etymology . There are several blimps worldwide . Some examples include :
Jehovah 's Witnesses , Old Order Amish , Christadelphians , Rastafarians and some other religious groups share a religious tradition of not participating in politics through voting . The joule ( or ) ; symbol J ) is a derived unit of energy or work in the International System of Units . It is equal to the energy expended ( or work done ) in applying a force of one newton through a distance of one metre ( 1 newton metre or NÂ m ) , or in passing an electric current of one ampere through a resistance of one ohm for one second . It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule ( 1818 â `` 1889 ) . where N is the newton , m is the metre , kg is the kilogram , s is the second , Pa is the pascal , and W is the watt . It is dimensionally correct to say that 1 joule equals 1 newton metre ( 1 J = 1 NÂ m = 1 kgÂ m2 Â sâ ' 2 ) ; however , these units are not interchangeable in practice . Instead , the SI authority recommends using newton metres ( NÂ m ) as the unit of torque , and joules as the unit of energy . Since torque and energy are very different , this convention is useful to help avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications . To understand the difference , consider that the distance part of a Joule is parallel to the force , while the distance part of a NÂ m is perpendicular to the force . In a topological sense , these distances are not equivalent , even though they carry the same unit . The nanojoule ( nJ ) is equal to one billionth of one joule . One nanojoule is about 1\/160 of the kinetic energy of a flying mosquito . The microjoule ( Î 1\/4 J ) is equal to one millionth of one joule . The Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) is expected to produce collisions on the order of 1 microjoule ( 7 TeV ) per particle . The millijoule ( mJ ) is equal to one thousandth of one joule . The kilojoule ( kJ ) is equal to one thousand joules . Food labels in some countries express food energy in kilojoules . One kilojoule per second ( 1000 watts ) is approximately the amount of solar radiation received by one square metre of the Earth in full daylight . The megajoule ( MJ ) is equal to one million joules , or approximately the kinetic energy of a one-tonne vehicle moving at 160 km\/h ( 100 mph ) . The gigajoule ( GJ ) is equal to one billion ( 10 ^ 9 or a thousand millions ) joules . Six gigajoules is about the amount of potential chemical energy in a barrel of oil , when combusted . The terajoule ( TJ ) is equal to one trillion joules . About 63 terajoules were released by the atomic bomb that exploded over Hiroshima . The International Space Station , at completion , with a mass of 450,000 kg and orbital velocity of 7.7 km\/s , will have a kinetic energy of roughly 13 terajoules . The exajoule ( EJ ) is equal to 1018 joules . The 2011 TÅ hoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan had 1.41 EJ of energy according to its 9.0 on the Richter magnitude scale . Energy in the United States used per year is roughly 105 EJ . The zettajoule ( ZJ ) is equal to 1021 joules . Annual global energy consumption is approximately 0.5 ZJ The yottajoule ( YJ ) is equal to 1024 joules .

Dow City is a city in Crawford County , Iowa , United States , along the Boyer River . The population was 503 at the 2000 census . The name is that of one of its founders . The community was founded in 1869 by Simon E. Dow and another person . Dow City is the location of the historic Dow House , which was built in 1872 . Dow City is located at ( 41.928195 , -95.494475 ) . According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 0.3 square miles ( 0.8 kmÂ ) , all of it land . Dow City is located on US Route 30 and is thirty miles north of Interstate 80 . As of the census of 2000 , there were 503 people , 227 households , and 142 families residing in the city .

Tin ( IV ) fluoride is a chemical compound of tin and fluorine with the chemical formula SnF4 and is a white solid with a melting point above 700 Â C. Sn + 2F2 â ' SnF4 However , a passivating metal fluoride layer will be created and the surface will eventually become unreactive . An alternative synthesis is the reaction of SnCl4 with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride : SnCl4 + 4HF â ' SnF4 + 4HCl With alkali metal fluorides ( e.g. KF ) hexafluorostannates are produced ( e.g. K2SnF6 ) , which contain the octahedral SnF62 â ' anion . SnF4 behaves as a Lewis acid and adducts L2 . SnF4 and L. SnF4 have been produced . Unlike the other tin tetrahalides , tin ( IV ) chloride , tin ( IV ) bromide , tin ( IV ) iodide which contain tetrahedrally coordinated tin , tin ( IV ) fluoride has a planar structure consisting of octahedra sharing four corners with the terminal , unshared , fluorine atoms trans to one another . The melting point of SnF4 is much higher ( 700 Â C ) than the other tin ( IV ) halides which are relatively low melting , ( SnCl4 , â ' 33.3 Â C ; SnBr4 , 31 Â C ; SnI4 , 144 Â C ) . The structure can also be contrasted with the tetrafluorides of the lighter members of group 14 , ( CF4 , SiF4 and GeF4 ) which in the solid state form molecular crystals . Commercial applications of the compound include using SnF4 in toothpaste to prevent dental decay .

Palmerston Park is a multi-purpose stadium on Terregles Street in Dumfries , south west Scotland . The site of the ground was formerly a farm called Palmers Toun . This is on the Maxwelltown side of the River Nith in Dumfries . It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home ground of Queen of the South F.C. . The stadium holds 6,412 people . It also holds the currently tallest free standing floodlights in Scottish football , standing at 85 feet . Jimmy McKinnell , Tom Wylie and Willie McCall were all sold to Blackburn Rovers around the same time by Queen of the South . This combined with the sale of Ian Dickson to Aston Villa helped to fund the purchase of Palmerston Park in 1921 for Â # 1,500 . Of the 6,412 capacity , there are 3,509 seats . There have been many changes in the ground since it was first opened in 1919 , including the removal of the `` coo shed '' and its replacement by chairman Norman Blount with a new all seater stand . A challenge game was held in April 1995 to commemorate the opening of the new stand and Queens ' 75th anniversary against Rangers . Guests for Queens in the 2 - 2 draw included Davie Irons , future managers Rowan Alexander and Ian McCall , Ted McMinn , Andy Thomson . Across from this all seater stand is the traditional `` old '' stand . This is a small , classic looking covered seating stand , where the seating area is raised . There are standing terraces for fans to the left , right and in front of this stand . This stand was constructed after the original main stand burned down in 1964 . The Portland Drive Terrace is a traditional standing area , reminiscent of all UK football grounds prior to the Hillsborough disaster . At the other end of the ground stands the Terregles Street end . This became the away supporters end after the Norman Blount built stand opened . Prior to the Blount stand in the days of the ` coo shed ' fans were able to change ends at half time to stand behind the goal being attacked by their team . The Terregles end is currently closed in need of repair . The grass playing surface is widely recognized for its good condition . Iain McChesney described the surface as simply a , ` Good park ' . Jocky Dempster later said in an interview that among his reasons for signing for Queens was , `` I liked the park at Queens . As you know itâ s a good park , a good surface . '' Crawford Boyd said , `` It was a lovely park , it was a treat to play on that park , a lovely playing surface . '' Ted McMinn commented , `` Palmerston was like a bowling green , you knew when you went to kick the ball you wouldnâ t get a bobble . '' Crowds for Queen of the South fixtures are normally around 2,000 people unless there is a major cup game against higher league opposition . The first league game against local rivals Gretna at the end of August 2006 attracted almost 5,500 spectators , which was Queen 's highest league attendance since 2002 . There was a full house at Queens ' 2007 Scottish Cup Quarter Final clash with Hibs in 2007 . Similarly , over 6,000 watched the victory over Dundee on 8 March 2008 for a place in the 2008 Scottish Cup Semi-finals . Modern attendances are small in comparison with Queens ' heyday in the 1930s , 40s , and 50s . For example 10,948 watched the team featuring Willie Savage , Willie Culbert and Willie Ferguson in Queens first ever game in the top flight of Scottish football in 1933 , the 3-2 win against Celtic . 13,000 watched Queens managed by George McLachlan and captained by Savage knock Rangers out of the Scottish Cup in January 1937 . However Jackie Oakes scored Queensâ goal in the game with the highest recorded attendance at Palmerston Park . On 23 February 1952 a crowd of 26,552 squeezed very tightly in to see Queens play in a Scottish Cup 3rd round 3-1 win for Hearts . Scenes from the film A Shot at Glory , starring Robert Duvall , were shot at Palmerston Park during 1999 . Instead of a straight forward promotion meritocracy , the members of the Scottish Premier League ( SPL ) have decreed that the club promoted each season as champions of the Scottish League First Division to the SPL must have a stadium with a minimum seating capacity for 6,000 fans . Despite the economic sensibility meaning scalable solutions are used widely in other industries , temporary seating facilities have been decreed as unacceptable by the SPL . This presents a significant barrier to many clubs in Scotland due to the limited budget available from relatively small population bases and the corresponding fan base potential . Palmerston Park has ample space for the deployment of additional seating should the funding for investment become available . The obstacle for clubs such as Queens is finding the capital for the required investment .
Negative feedback occurs when the output of a system acts to oppose changes to the input of the system , with the result that the changes are attenuated . If the overall feedback of the system is negative , then the system will tend to be stable . In many physical and biological systems , qualitatively different influences can oppose each other . For example , in biochemistry , one set of chemicals drives the system in a given direction , whereas another set of chemicals drives it in an opposing direction . If one , or both of these opposing influences are non-linear , equilibrium point ( s ) result . In biology , this process ( generally biochemical ) is often referred to as homeostasis ; whereas in mechanics , the more common term is equilibrium . In engineering , mathematics and the physical and biological sciences , common terms for the points around which the system gravitates include : attractors , stable states , eigenstates\/eigenfunctions , equilibrium points , and setpoints . Negative refers to the sign of the multiplier in mathematical models for feedback . In delta notation , output is added to or mixed into the input . In multivariate systems , vectors help to illustrate how several influences can both partially complement and partially oppose each other . In contrast , positive feedback is feedback in which the system responds so as to increase the magnitude of any particular perturbation , resulting in amplification of the original signal instead of stabilization . Any system where there is a net positive feedback will result in a runaway situation . Both positive and negative feedback require a feedback loop to operate . Negative feedback is used to describe the act of reversing any discrepancy between desired and actual output . Negative feedback was first implemented in the 16th Century with the invention of the centrifugal governor . Its operation is most easily seen in its use by James Watt to control the speed of his steam engine . Two heavy balls on an upright frame rotate at the same speed as the engine . As their speed increases they move outwards due to the centrifugal force . This causes them to lift a mechanism which closes the steam inlet valve and the engine slows . When the speed of the engine falls too far , the balls will move in the opposite direction and open the steam valve . Examples of the use of negative feedback to control its system are : thermostat control , phase-locked loop , hormonal regulation ( see diagram above ) , and temperature regulation in animals . A simple and practical example is a thermostat . When the temperature in a heated room reaches a certain upper limit the room heating is switched off so that the temperature begins to fall . When the temperature drops to a lower limit , the heating is switched on again . Provided the limits are close to each other , a steady room temperature is maintained . Similar control mechanisms are used in cooling systems , such as an air conditioner , a refrigerator , or a freezer . Some biological systems exhibit negative feedback such as the baroreflex in blood pressure regulation and erythropoiesis . Many biological process ( e.g. , in the human anatomy ) use negative feedback . Examples of this are numerous , from the regulating of body temperature , to the regulating of blood glucose levels . The disruption of feedback loops can lead to undesirable results : in the case of blood glucose levels , if negative feedback fails , the glucose levels in the blood may begin to rise dramatically , thus resulting in diabetes . For hormone secretion regulated by the negative feedback loop : when gland X releases hormone X , this stimulates target cells to release hormone Y. When there is an excess of hormone Y , gland X `` senses '' this and inhibits its release of hormone X. In economics , automatic stabilisers are government programs which work as negative feedback to dampen fluctuations in real GDP . The negative feedback amplifier was invented by Harold Stephen Black at Bell Laboratories in 1927 , and patented by him in 1934 . Fundamentally , all electronic devices ( e.g. vacuum tubes , bipolar transistors , MOS transistors ) exhibit some nonlinear behavior . Negative feedback corrects this by trading unused gain for higher linearity ( lower distortion ) . An amplifier with too large an open-loop gain , possibly in a specific frequency range , will additionally produce too large a feedback signal in that same range . This feedback signal , when subtracted from the original input , will act to reduce the original input , also by `` too large '' an amount . This `` too small '' input will be amplified again by the `` too large '' open-loop gain , creating a signal that is `` just right '' . The net result is a flattening of the amplifier 's gain over all frequencies ( desensitising ) . Though much more accurate , amplifiers with negative feedback can become unstable if not designed correctly , causing them to oscillate . Harry Nyquist of Bell Laboratories managed to work out a theory about how to make this behavior stable . Negative feedback is used in this way in many types of amplification systems to stabilize and improve their operating characteristics ( see e.g. , operational amplifiers ) .
Rafael Augusto SÃ bis do Nascimento ( born 17 June 1985 in Erechim , Rio Grande do Sul ) , commonly known as Rafael SÃ bis , is a Brazilian footballer of Ukrainian descent , who plays for Internacional . He started in the youth categories of Internacional , known only as Rafael . Inter 's president at the time , Fernando Carvalho , suggested the change to only Sobis , the surname of his Ukrainian origins , because it could be more attractive for the European leagues , where the boy could get dual citizenship . He went to the main team in 2004 and quickly won a place in it , being known by his name along the surname ( with acute accent ) , Rafael SÃ bis . SÃ bis scored 19 goals in 35 matches in the 2005 season at the age of 19 . In the following year , he was one of the main players in the Internacional squad that finished the Brazilian League in second place , and was selected by the CBF to play in the all star team at the end of the season . The 2006 season started slowly for him , as he fought against a series of injuries . He eventually recovered his place in the first team and helped Internacional secure the Libertadores title ; scoring twice in the first-leg of the final match against SÃ # o Paulo . Following interest from AC Milan and Racing de Santander , Rafael SÃ bis signed for Real Betis in August 2006 for â 9 million , putting pen to paper on a 8 year contract , a length reminiscent to that of fellow Brazilian international DenÃ lson . He was officially unveiled to the press on 8 September 2006 and made his Real Betis and La Liga debut against Athletic Bilbao two days later on 10 September at the Manuel Ruiz de Lopera stadium , a game that Betis won 3-0 . SÃ bis scored his first goals against city rivals Sevilla on 17 September , a match that Betis eventually lost 3-2 . SÃ bis also managed to score important goals against Celta de Vigo , a debut game for then newly appointed coach Luis FernÃ ndez . Ligament damage sustained in a game against RCD Mallorca meant SÃ bis missed a month of La Liga action . SÃ bis major contribution to the 2006-2007 season was his dramatic late equaliser against Barcelona at the Camp Nou , assisted by fellow Brazilian Marcos AssunÃ Ã # o. SÃ bis began his second season with Betis strongly , scoring three goals in his first six games , including goals against La Liga giants Valencia CF , RCD Mallorca and 2007 UEFA Cup finalists RCD Espanyol but once again the Brazilian 's form dipped .

SÃ bis made his debut for Brazil on September 3 , 2006 against Argentina in London . Brazil won the match 3-0 with SÃ bis making his appearance as a late substitute . He scored his first Brazil 's goal in an unofficial friendly match against Kuwaiti club Al Kuwait on October 7 , 2006 . In 2008 , he was included in Brazil U-23 team for the 2008 Summer Olympics , which Brazil went on to finish third and achieve bronze medal .
Lindsborg is a city in McPherson County , Kansas , USA . As of the 2010 census , the city population was 3,458 . It is known for its association with Swedish heritage and the biennial Svensk Hyllningsfest . Lindsborg is known as `` Little Sweden '' because it was settled by Swedish immigrants in the late 19th century . The City of Lindsborg was settled in the spring of 1869 by a group of Swedish immigrants from the VÃ rmland province of Sweden led by Pastor Olof Olsson .

`` You Never Give Me Your Money '' is a song by The Beatles that opens the climactic medley on side two of the album Abbey Road . It was written by Paul McCartney and is credited to Lennon\/McCartney . The song begins with two verses sung by McCartney in a large-sound , almost classical style . This is followed by a section played in a double time swing feel with McCartney switching to a more nasal vocal style , using a mock-baritone voice which contrasts the song 's somewhat poignant lyrics . Next comes an instrumental interlude with George Harrison 's aggressive blues rock-style and a concluding unison line between guitar and bass . The song fades out with a chant reminiscent of a nursery rhyme , set to a Harrison guitar riff similar to a previous album track , `` Here Comes the Sun '' ( in turn based on a previous Harrison\/Eric Clapton composition , `` Badge '' ) . The riff will return later in the medley 's track `` Carry That Weight '' . The song 's production is notable for prominent use of leslie-amplified , arpeggiated guitar parts , which would become synonymous with the late-era Beatles sound . It slowly and quietly segues into `` Sun King '' . The Beatles recorded 26 takes of `` You Never Give Me Your Money '' on 6 May 1969 , with McCartney on piano and vocals , Lennon and Harrison on guitar and Starr on drums . At this early stage the song ended abruptly prior to the `` One two three four five six seven '' refrain . On 1 July McCartney overdubbed lead vocals onto take 30 , and added more vocals and chimes on 15 July . `` You Never Give Me Your Money '' was originally to segue into `` Sun King '' with a long organ note . This was recorded along with more vocals on 30 July . They were scrapped the following day , when McCartney completed the song by adding bass guitar and piano . The `` Sun King '' crossfade was completed on 5 August with a series of tape loops containing the sounds of bells , birds , bubbles and insects . In 1976 , Will Malone & Lou Reizner covered the song for the transitory musical documentary All This and World War II . Sufjan Stevens alludes to this song in `` Dear Mr. Supercomputer '' on his 2006 album The Avalanche . The original line is `` One two three four five six seven \/ All good children go to heaven . '' Stevens ' line is `` One two three four five six seven \/ All computers go to heaven '' . Tenacious D regularly includes this song in their live performances as a `` Beatles ' Medley '' . Glenn Tilbrook with Nine Below Zero cover the song on `` Abbey Road Now ! '' the Mojo ( magazine ) October 2009 cover CD along with covers of all Abbey Road 's songs . Harvey Danger played the song at their final All Ages show at The Vera Project in Seattle , WA . Lead singer Sean Nelson cited it as being his favorite song by The Beatles in a Q&A session at the end of the show .
Old Street station is a central London National Rail and London Underground station located at the junction of Old Street and City Road just north of the City of London . It lies on the border between the boroughs of Islington and Hackney . The station is in Travelcard Zone 1 . The station is on the Bank branch of London Underground 's Northern Line , between Moorgate and Angel stations . It is also between Moorgate and Essex Road stations on National Rail 's Northern City Line , operated by First Capital Connect . Although a through station on this route , for ticketing purposes , it is considered a central London railway terminus . At the surface , the station is situated under the eastern edge of the busy Old Street roundabout , where Old Street crosses City Road . There is no ground-level station building , access being by ramps and stairs to a modern station entrance which is part of a small shopping parade beneath the roundabout . The original ground-level buildings were removed when the roundabout was constructed . The station has toilets , but they are not open late into the evening . On the Northern Line between Old Street and Angel stations is the disused tube station City Road . The station was originally opened in November 1901 by the first deep-level tube railway , the City & South London Railway , as part of an extension of its line from Moorgate to Angel . The Northern City Line platforms were opened in February 1904 by the Great Northern & City Railway which built its tunnels to a larger diameter capable of accommodating main line trains in the hope of carrying trains from its northern terminus at the Great Northern Railway 's Finsbury Park station to Moorgate . This eventually happened in the 1970s , with the line becoming a BR route , with through services to Hertford and Welwyn Garden City . During the 1920s the station was rebuilt when escalators ( 1 & 2 ) replaced the lift shaft in accessing the platform tunnels . Between 1967 and 1969 the station was once again modified , the surface building was replaced with the current sub-surface structure situated in the center of the roundabout and an additional escalator shaft ( 3 ) was added . During the 1990s the effects of corrosion caused by excessive soil acidity required a section of the cast iron running tunnel lining in the Northern Line , south of Old Street , to be re-lined with stainless steel tunnel segments . London bus routes 21 , 43 , 55 , 76 , 135 , 141 , 205 , 214 , 243 , 271 and 394 Night routes N35 , N55 , N76 .
Papa Smurf is a male fictional character from the Smurfs . He is the third oldest of the Smurfs ( after Grandpa and Nanny ) at 542 years old ( while the other Smurfs are approximately 100 years old ) , but is quite energetic for his age . He can be easily distinguished from the other Smurfs by his red clothes and his bushy white beard ( which was brown in his younger days ) . Don Messick provided Papa Smurf 's voice in the 1980s animated series and the special , Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue , and Jonathan Winters in the upcoming 2011 film . In the original French , his name is `` Le Grand Schtroumpf '' -- `` the Great Smurf '' or `` the Big Smurf '' -- which could also be interpreted as `` Le Grand PÃ re '' , French for grandfather , which would be in keeping with his elderly appearance and paternal way . Papa Smurf is a gentle , wise , and knowledgeable village elder . He serves as the Smurfs ' leader and as a paternal figure to whom the Smurfs usually go to when they require counsel . He is always concerned about the Smurf 's wellbeing and harmony . He is very altruistic and always ready to help somebody , whether he is a Smurf or human . Papa Smurf also has diplomatic skills in case they meet humans or other creatures , and usually manages to speak without using the `` smurf '' word . In the original comic books by Peyo , Papa Smurf had a more forceful personality , and had a short-temper ( often seen getting angry with his smurfs when they did something wrong or were not obeying his orders ) . Papa Smurf 's duty is to ensure all the Smurfs of the village get along well , are nice to each other , and do n't fight . When real chaos rises among them , Papa Smurf takes very drastic measures , often using magic , such as switching bodies with Gargamel in order to pretend to attack the village ( `` Smurf Versus Smurf '' comic adventure ) ( `` Romeo & Smurfette '' TV episode ) or even creating a whole other village of evil doubles of the original Smurfs ( `` The Smurf Menace '' issue ) . While Papa Smurf would sometimes prefer not to have to constantly fix problems , he came to realize it was his calling . One time he said that because he may not be able to be the village leader forever , every Smurf should have a brief experience of commanding the village , which was signified by him handing over his signature red hat and having the designated Smurf wear it and direct others on a construction project . The Smurfs were then at different points wearing the hat and being referred to as `` Papa Greedy '' , `` Papa Clumsy '' or `` Mama Smurfette '' . While Papa felt it important that each Smurf gain leadership skills , his true purpose was to be always guiding the Smurfs and fixing their problems and mistakes . When he is not doing his leader or `` father-knows-best '' job , Papa Smurf indulges in his favorite hobby : magical chemistry , or alchemy . He often makes elixirs to help Smurfs who get themselves into trouble . The French comic portrays Papa Smurf constantly preparing magical drinks from white hellebore ( the drawings in which the effects of these alchemical brews are shown are both turbulent and amusing ) . As well as his house , he also has a laboratory containing several chemical devices , and he tries to create potions for the good of the Smurfs , yet sometimes fails - such as the time he accidentally created a substance that turned any living thing into a huge monster ( see the album : The Smurfs and the Cracoucass and the cartoon episode `` The Smurfs and the Howlibird '' ) . Impassioned by this activity , he occasionally leaves the village in order to get the needed ingredients .
Middleweight is a division , or weight class , in boxing . Early boxing history is less than exact , but the middleweight designation seems to have begun in the 1840s . In the bare-knuckle era , the first middleweight championship fight was between Tom Chandler and Dooney Harris in 1867 . Chandler won , becoming known as the American middleweight champion . The first middleweight fight with gloves may have been between George Fulljames and Jack ( Nonpareil ) Dempsey ( no relation to the more famous heavyweight of the same name ) . Dempsey knocked out Fulljames on July 30 , 1884 . In the modern era , middleweight means that the fighter 's official weight does not exceed 160 pounds ( 72.64 kg ) . ( In practice , however , since weigh-ins take place usually 24 hours before the actual fight , many fighters show up at the actual ringside weighing more . ) The current linear middleweight champion , Sergio Martinez , won a U.D. victory in April 2010 , defeating the defending champion , Kelly Pavlik .

Hope is the belief in a positive outcome related to events and circumstances in one 's life . Hope is distinct from positive thinking , which refers to a therapeutic or systematic process used in psychology for reversing pessimism . The term false hope refers to a hope based entirely around a fantasy or an extremely unlikely outcome . Hope was personified in Greek mythology as Elpis . When Pandora opened Pandora 's Box , she let out all the evil except one : hope . It may be worthy to note that in the story , hope is in effect far more potent than any of the major evils , which include lust and envy . One man loves Hope because of her beauty , smile , and personality . In some faiths and religions of the world , hope plays a very important role . Hope can be passive in the sense of a wish , or active as a plan or idea , often against popular belief , with persistent , personal action to execute the plan or prove the idea . Consider a prisoner of war who never gives up hope for escape and , against the odds , plans and accomplishes this . By contrast , consider another prisoner who simply wishes or prays for freedom , but without genuine hope , or another who gives up all hope of freedom . ' In Human , All Too Human , philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche argued that `` Zeus did not want man to throw his life away , no matter how much the other evils might torment him , but rather to go on letting himself be tormented anew . To that end , he gives man hope . In truth , it is the most evil of evils because it prolongs man 's torment . '' Emily Dickinson wrote in a poem that '' ` Hope ' is the thing with feathers -- \/ That perches in the soul -- . '' Ernst Bloch in `` Principle of Hope '' ( 1986 ) traces the human journey for a wide range of utopias . Bloch locates utopian projects not only in the social and political realms of the well-known utopian theorists ( Marx , Hegel , Lenin ) but also in a multiplicity of technical , architectural , geographical utopias , and in multiple works of art ( opera , literature , music , dance , film ) . For Bloch hope permeates everyday life and it is present in countless aspects of popular culture phenomenon such as jokes , fairy tales , fashion or images of death . In his view Hope remains in the present as an open setting of latency and tendencies . Martin Seligman in his book Learned Optimisms ( 1990 ) strongly criticizes the role of Catholic churches in the promotion of the idea that the individual has little chance or hope of affecting his or her life . He acknowledges that the social and cultural conditions , such as serfdom and the caste system weighed heavily against the freedom of folks to change the social circumstances of their lives . In his book What You Can Change and What You Ca n't , he is careful to outline the extent that people can hold out hope for personal action to change some of the things that affect their lives . In psychology , hope is normally considered to involve two components ; ( 1 ) agency , involving the expectancy of positive outcomes , and ( 2 ) pathways , involving the ability to see how those positive outcomes can be reached . Hope is important to both well-being and educational performance ; people low in hope are more likely to be anxious and depressed , and a recent longitudinal study showed that college students who were low in hope in their first year attained worse degree results three years later , even after controlling for intelligence , other personality traits , and previous performance .
A unitary state is a sovereign state governed as one single unit in which the central government is supreme and any administrative divisions ( subnational units ) exercise only powers that the central government chooses to delegate . Many states in the world have a unitary system of government . Devolution ( like federation ) may be symmetrical , with all subnational units having the same powers and status , or asymmetric , with regions varying in their powers and status .

A hat is a head covering used for several reasons . It may be worn for protection against the elements , for ceremonial or religious reasons , for safety , or as a fashion accessory . In the past , hats were an indicator of social status . In the military , they may denote nationality , branch of service , rank and\/or regiment . One of the first pictorial depictions of a hat appears in a Thebes tomb painting which shows a man wearing a coolie-style straw hat . Other early hats were the Pileus , a simple skull cap ; the Phrygian cap , worn by freed slaves in Greece and Rome ; and the Greek Pestasos , the first known hat with a brim . Women wore veils , kerchiefs , hoods , caps and wimples . Structured hats for women similar to those of male courtiers began to be worn in the late 16th century . The term â millinerâ comes from the Italian city of Milan , where the best quality hats were made in the 18th century . Millinery was traditionally a womanâ s occupation , with the milliner not only creating hats and bonnets but also choosing lace , trimmings and accessories to complete an outfit . In the first half of the 19th century , women wore bonnets that gradually became larger , decorated with ribbons , flowers , feathers and gauze trims . By the end of the century , many other styles were introduced , among them hats with wide brims and flat crowns , the flower pot and the toque . By the middle of the 1920s , when women began to cut their hair short , they chose hats that hugged the head like a helmet . One of the most famous London hatters is James Lock & Co of St James 's Street . Another was Sharp & Davis of 6 Fish Street Hill . John B. Stetson is a well-known American hat company . In the late 20th century museums credited London-based David Shilling with reinventing hats worldwide . Notable Belgian hat designers are Elvis Pompilio and Fabienne Delvigne , whose hats are worn by European royals . St. Clement , the patron saint of felt hatmakers , is said to have discovered wool felt when he filled his sandals with flax fibers to protect his feet . Philip Treacy OBE is an award-winning Irish milliner who designs hats for the most important designers in the world and for such women as Sarah Jessica Parker and Lady Gaga . Hat sizes are determined by measuring the circumference of a person 's head about 1\/2 inch ( 1.3 cm ) above the ears . Inches or centimeters may be used depending on the manufacturer . Felt hats can be stretched for a custom fit . Some hats , like hard hats and baseball caps , are adjustable . Cheaper hats come in standard sizes , such as small , medium , large . Traditional hat size is worked out by adding the fore and aft and side to side measurements ( in inches ) then dividing by two . In the UK , an equivalent hat size is an eighth of an inch smaller than in the US .
In logic and mathematics , a truth value , sometimes called a logical value , is a value indicating the relation of a proposition to truth . In classical logic , with its intended semantics , the truth values are true and false ; that is , classical logic is a two-valued logic . Intuitionistic logic lacks a complete set of truth values because its semantics , the Brouwerâ `` Heytingâ `` Kolmogorov interpretation , is specified in terms of provability conditions , and not directly in terms of the truth of formulae . Multi-valued logics ( such as fuzzy logic and relevance logic ) allow for more than two truth values , possibly containing some internal structure . Even non-truth-valuational logics can associate values with logical formulae , as is done in algebraic semantics . For example , the algebraic semantics of intuitionistic logic is given in terms of Heyting algebras . Topos theory uses truth values in a special sense : the truth values of a topos are the global elements of the subobject classifier . Having truth values in this sense does not make a logic truth valuational .
The telescope has also been used in combination with the VLA to carry out a weak lensing analysis . Peter SchÃ ttel ( born 26 March 1967 ) is a retired Austrian footballer . In his whole career SchÃ ttel played exclusively for Rapid Vienna , what made him a cult hero with Rapid fans . He also was Rapid 's captain from 1997 until 2001 . He won league and domestic cup titles with Rapid and played the full 90 minutes of the 1996 UEFA Cup Winners Cup Final against Paris St Germain in Brussels , which Rapid lost . In 1999 he was chosen in Rapid 's Team of the Century . After he had quit playing himself , he started working as a coach for the Rapid amateurs continuing his association with the club until 2006 . On 11 November 2006 , after sustaining criticism for negotiating TV punditry contracts while allowing his duties at Rapid to wain , he left the club . In the summer of 2007 , he began work as a trainer with Wiener Sportclub with his contract running until the end of June 2008 . His squad number , 5 , has been retired by Rapid Vienna until the 2011 season as a mark of respect to SchÃ ttel 's playing career . He made his debut for Austria in a February 1988 friendly match against Switzerland and was a participant at the 1990 FIFA World Cup and 1998 FIFA World Cup . He earned 62 caps , no goals scored . His final international match was the embarrassing 0-9 demolition by Spain in a European Championship qualification match in March 1999 , 2002 he just played for four minutes in a friendly match against Norway for his official retirement .
The Charlotte was a First Fleet transport ship of 335 tons , built on the River Thames in 1784 . She was a light sailer , and had to be towed down the English Channel for the first few days of the voyage . Her master was Thomas Gilbert , and her surgeon was John White , principal surgeon to the colony . She left Portsmouth on 13 May 1787 , carrying eighty-eight male and twenty female convicts , among them were James Squire , James Bloodsworth , James Underwood , Samuel Lightfoot and the later-to-be-famous Mary Bryant , and arrived at Port Jackson , Sydney , Australia , on 26 January 1788 . She left Port Jackson on 6 May 1788 bound for China to take on a cargo of tea , under charter to the East India Company . On her return to England on 28 November 1789 she was sold to Bond and Co. , Walbrook merchants , for the London to Jamaica run , and was lost off Newfoundland in November 1818 .
The Vice-President of the Executive Council was the deputy head of government of the 1922 â `` 1937 Irish Free State , and the second most senior member of the Executive Council ( cabinet ) . Formally the Vice-President was appointed by the Governor-General on the `` nomination '' of the President of the Executive Council , but by convention the Governor General could not refuse to appoint a Vice-President who the President had selected . Under Article 53 of the Free State constitution the role of the Vice President was to `` act for all purposes in the place of the President '' , until the appointment of a successor in the event of his death , resignation or `` permanent incapacity '' , or until his return in the event of his `` temporary absence '' . However in practice the Vice President also held a second ministerial portfolio the duties of which he carried out when not called upon to become acting head of government . The Vice President could not be dismissed by the President . Rather , as was the case with all other cabinet ministers , for him to be removed from office the entire cabinet had to be dismissed and reformed en bloc . The office of Vice President of the Executive Council was established with the establishment of the Free State in 1922 . Neither of the two administrations that preceded the Free State , the Ministry of the Irish Republic and the Provisional Government of Southern Ireland , included an office corresponding to deputy prime minister . In 1937 , when the new Constitution of Ireland came into force , the office of Vice-President of the Executive Council was replaced with that of TÃ naiste .
Piano blues refers to a variety of blues styles , sharing only the characteristic that they use the piano as the primary musical instrument . Boogie woogie is the best known kind of piano blues , though barrelhouse , swing , R&B , rock and roll and jazz are strongly influenced by early pianists who played the blues . Notable blues pianists include Roosevelt Sykes , Memphis Slim , Otis Spann , Sunnyland Slim , Pinetop Perkins , Dr. John , and Ray Charles . Piano Blues is also the title of an episode of Martin Scorsese 's documentary series The Blues . The episode was directed by Clint Eastwood , himself an avid piano blues enthusiast and one-time jazz pianist . Eastwood interviews several blues and jazz pianists , including Marcia Ball , Pinetop Perkins , Dave Brubeck , Jay McShann , Ray Charles , and Dr. John . More information is available on the episode 's website .
Sentimentality is both a literary device used to induce a tender emotional response disproportionate to the situation at hand , and thus to substitute heightened and generally uncritical feeling for normal ethical and intellectual judgments , and a heightened reader response willing to invest previously prepared emotions to respond disproportionately to a literary situation . `` A sentimentalist '' , Oscar Wilde wrote Alfred Douglas , `` is one who desires to have the luxury of an emotion without paying for it . '' Yeats wrote , `` Rhetoric is fooling others . Sentimentality is fooling yourself . '' In modern times `` sentimental '' is a pejorative term that has been casually applied to works of art and literature that exceed the viewer or reader 's sense of decorumâ '' the extent of permissible emotionâ '' and standards of taste : `` excessiveness '' is the criterion ; `` Meretricious '' and `` contrived '' sham pathos are the hallmark of sentimentality , where the morality that underlies the work is both intrusive and pat . Sentimentality applies feelings in inappropriate situations . The sentimental fallacy is an ancient rhetorical device that attributes human emotions , such as grief or anger , to the forces of nature . Complications enter into the ordinary view of sentimentality when changes in fashion and settingâ '' the `` climate of thought '' â '' intrude between the work and the reader . The view that sentimentality is relative is inherent in John Ciardi 's `` sympathetic contract '' , in which the reader agrees to join with the writer when approaching a poem . The example of the death of Little Nell in Charles Dickens ' The Old Curiosity Shop ( 1840-41 ) , `` a scene that for many readers today might represent a defining instance of sentimentality '' , brought tears to the eye of many highly critical readers of the day . The reader of Dickens , Richard Holt Hutton observed , `` has the painful impression of pathos feasting upon itself . ''
The Suwannee River ( also spelled Suwanee River ) is a major river of southern Georgia and northern Florida in the United States . It is a wild blackwater river , about 266 miles long . The Suwannee River is the site of the prehistoric Suwannee Straits which separated peninsular Florida from the panhandle . The river rises in the Okefenokee Swamp , emerging at Fargo , Georgia . The river then runs southwest into Florida , dropping in elevation through limestone layers resulting in a rare Florida whitewater rapid . It then turns west near White Springs , Florida , receiving the waters of the Alapaha and Withlacoochee Rivers , which together drain much of south-central Georgia . This meandering forms the southern border of Hamilton County , Florida . It then bends south near Ellaville , then southeast near Luraville , receives the Santa Fe River from the east just below Branford , then south again to the Gulf of Mexico near the town of Suwannee . As the river turns north-northwest near White Springs , Florida , it begins to border the Suwannee Valley and Suwannee County . This continues to form a `` C '' - shaped curve as it drops southeast , and south again . The Suwanee River area has been inhabited by humans for thousands of years . During the first millennium AD it was inhabited by the people of the Weedon Island archaeological culture , and around 900 a derivative local culture , known as the Suwanee River Valley culture , developed . By the 16th century the river was inhabited by two closely related Timucua tribes : the Yustaga , who lived on the west side of the river , and the Northern Utina , who lived on the east side . The name `` Suwanee '' developed around this time . A University of South Florida website states the `` Timucuan Indian word Suwani means Echo River ... River of Reeds , Deep Water , or Crooked Black Water . '' Jerald Milanovich states that `` Suwannee '' developed through `` San Juan-ee '' from the 17th-century Spanish mission of San Juan de Guacara , located on the river known to the Spanish as `` Guacara '' . In the 18th century , Seminoles lived by the river . The steamboat Madison operated on the river before the Civil War , and the sulphur springs at White Springs became popular as a health resort , with 14 hotels in operation in the late 19th century . The Suwannee is not to be confused with the mountaintop town of Sewanee , Tennessee , home of the University of the South . A popular bumper sticker there reads `` Sewanee is not a river '' . This river is the subject of the Stephen Foster song `` Old Folks at Home '' , in which he calls it the Swanee River . Foster had named the Pedee River of South Carolina in his first lyrics . It was called Swanee River because Foster had misspelled the name . Foster never saw the river he made world famous . George Gershwin 's song , made popular by Al Jolson , is also spelled `` Swanee '' , and boasts that `` the folks up North will see me no more when I get to that Swanee shore '' . Both these songs feature strumming banjos and reminiscences of a plantation life more typical of 19th century South Carolina along the Peedee than among the swamps and small farms of the coastal plain of Georgia and Florida . Don Ameche stars as Foster in the 1939 fictional biopic Swanee River . When crossing the river by car today , the sign greeting visitors announces that they are crossing the Historic Suwannee River , complete with the first line of sheet music from the song . `` Old Folks at Home '' is the state song of Florida , designated as such in 1935 . There is a Foster Museum and Carillon Tower at Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center State Park at White Springs . The spring itself is called White Sulphur Springs because of its high sulphur content . Because of a belief in the healing qualities of its waters , the Springs were long popular as a health resort . In English parlance something going `` up the Swannee '' or `` down the swanny '' means something going badly wrong ; analogous to `` up the creek without a paddle '' . A unique aspect of the Suwannee River is the Suwannee River Wilderness Trail . The Trail is a cooperative effort by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection , the Suwannee River Water Management District and the cities , businesses and citizens of the eight-county region of the Suwannee River Basin . The Trail encompasses 170 river miles from Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center State Park to the Gulf of Mexico . The Lower Suwannee National Wildlife Refuge offers bird and wildlife observation , wildlife photography , fishing , canoeing , hunting , and interpretive walks . A wildlife driving tour is under construction and several boardwalks and observation towers offer views of refuge wildlife and habitat . In recent years , the Suwannee River has been the site of music gatherings . Magnolia Festival , SpringFest , and Wanee have are held annually in Live Oak , Florida , at the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park , adjacent to the river . Performing artists include Vassar Clements , Peter Rowan , David Grisman , Allman Brothers Band , and the String Cheese Incident .

James Joseph Wisniewski ( born February 21 , 1984 ) is an American professional ice hockey player currently playing for the Montreal Canadiens of the NHL . Wisniewski started his junior hockey career with his hometown Plymouth Whalers of the OHL , in 2000 . He improved every year significantly , and was drafted in the 5th round by the Blackhawks in 2002 . At the start of the 2003 â `` 04 season , he was named captain of the Whalers . Wielding a rocket slap-shot ( good for 17 goals , 11 on the power-play ) , `` Wiz '' was arguably one of the best defenseman in the OHL that year . He finished 24th in overall scoring with 70 points , but 3rd among defenseman , short 6 points of Kingston Frontenacs defenseman Bryan Rodney . However , Wisniewski played in 17 fewer games , playing in only 50 to Rodney 's 67 ( in a 68 game season ) . For his work , Wisniewski was awarded the OHL 's 2004 Max Kaminsky Trophy as most outstanding defenceman . The accolades did n't stop there , as Wisniewski also took home the parent league , CHL 's Defenseman of the Year award . This recognition gained Wisniewski a contract with Chicago , and a jump to the AHL 's Norfolk Admirals . Wisniewski was called up early to the Blackhawks in the 2006 â `` 07 season and stuck with the Blackhawks . James tore his ACL during the 1st period against Los Angeles on March 5 , 2007 . He was placed on injured reserve and missed the rest of the season . On March 4 , 2009 , Wisniewski was traded by the Blackhawks along with Petri Kontiola to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for Samuel Pahlsson and Logan Stephenson . In the 2009 â `` 10 season , Wisniewski entrenched himself in the Ducks defense corps and established a career-high 30 points in 69 games . On March 17 , 2010 , in a game against former team , the Blackhawks , Wisniewski delivered a retaliation hit to Brent Seabrook , his former teammate and good friend , driving his head against the glass . Wisniewski received an eight-game suspension for his hit . The last player to receive an 8 game suspension was former Duck Chris Pronger . On July 30 , 2010 , Wisniewski was traded by the Ducks to the New York Islanders for a conditional 3rd-round pick in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft . On October 12 , 2010 , he was suspended for two games for making an obscene gesture towards Sean Avery . On December 28 , 2010 , he was traded to the Montreal Canadiens for second-round pick in the 2011 draft and conditional 5th round pick in the 2012 draft . Wisniewski started a clothing line called WizWear . According to Wisniewski , `` I always like to dress nice and have my own style . We support the USO of Illinois , the families of fallen soldiers . I wanted to do something a little bit different to set up for a charity than a golf tournament or bowling event . It 's something I can have a little bit of fun with also . '' Both of his grandfathers fought in World War II . Wisniewski is the nephew of former NHL player and coach Billy Dea .
Styphnolobium japonicum ( L. ) Schott , the Pagoda Tree ( Chinese Scholar , Japanese pagodatree ; syn . Sophora japonica ) is a species of small tree or shrub in the subfamily Faboideae of the pea family Fabaceae . It was formerly included within a broader interpretation of the genus Sophora . The species of Styphnolobium differ from Sophora in lacking the ability to form symbioses with rhizobia ( nitrogen fixing bacteria ) on their roots . It also differs from the related genus Calia ( mescalbeans ) in having deciduous leaves and flowers in axillary , not terminal , racemes . The leaves are pinnate , with 9-21 leaflets , and the flowers in pendulous racemes similar to those of the Black locust . Styphnolobium japonicum is native to eastern Asia ( mainly China ; despite the name , it is introduced in Japan ) , is a popular ornamental tree in Europe , North America and South Africa , grown for its white flowers , borne in late summer after most other flowering trees have long finished flowering . It grows into a lofty tree 10-20 m tall with an equal spread , and produces a fine , dark brown timber . The Guilty Chinese Scholartree was a historic Pagoda Tree in Beijing , on which the last emperor of the Ming Dynasty , Chongzhen , hanged himself . S. japonicum ( ; formerly Sophora japonica ) is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine . It has abortifacient , antibacterial , anticholesterolemic , antiinflammatory , antispasmodic , diuretic , emetic , emollient , febrifuge , hypotensive , purgative , styptic , and tonic properties . The Chinese name for the tree ( æ ) is composed of the word æ ( `` wood '' ) and é 1\/4 ( `` demon '' ) . In folklore , it is said that a cowherd once built a home out of this species of tree , and within a month his entire family was suddenly found dead , with no signs of foulplay . It was therefore believed that demons are drawn to this tree and it is therefore not appropriate to use its wood to build homes . In addition , in the wild , other species of tree rarely grow near it .

Antonio Di Natale ( born 13 October 1977 in Naples ) is an Italian footballer who plays for Serie A club Udinese . A versatile striker , Di Natale can play anywhere in the front line , as a lone striker or out wide in a 3-pronged attack but is most effective when played as an out-and-out striker . He is notable for his dribbling skills , pace and for his ability to score and create goals . Though born in Naples , Antonio Di Natale moved up north and joined Empoli 's youth system . He impressed while playing for the Tuscany side in Serie A and even received his first Azzurri call-up . He was awarded a contract extension . When Empoli was relegated he moved to Udinese . After having joined Udinese in the 2004 â `` 05 Serie A season , Di Natale partnered with Vincenzo Iaquinta and David Di Michele in attack , and the Friulian club finished 4th place at the end of the season and qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the following year . Di Natale finished his debut season with a record of 33 games and seven goals . In the 2007 â `` 08 season , Di Natale scored 17 goals . The two most notable goals were scored on matchday 4 , when Udinese played against Reggina . He made a zero-degree lob in the 5th minute and scored a terrific volley in the 63rd . Forming a formidable attacking duo with Fabio Quagliarella , Di Natale improved his aggressiveness and stealth . In 2007 , he was named captain of Udinese and his contract was extended to 30 June 2012 . 15 May 2010 saw the conclusion of Di Natale 's best-ever season , scoring 29 goals in Serie A , and contributing 54 % of Udinese 's total goals . He also surpassed Oliver Bierhoff 's club record for most league goals in a season , who had scored 28 . A brace against Bari on 9 May 2010 saw Di Natale surpass the 100 goal mark in Serie A. For his performances , Di Natale was voted Italian Footballer of the Year and finished as the top scorer in Serie A. He also received the Serie A Fair Play award , for interrupting play in a match while Lazio 's Libor Kozak was injured , with Udinese down 3-2 late in the game . On 14 November 2010 , he scored a hat-trick during a match with Udinese against Lecce and on 28 November 2010 , he scored a second consecutive home hat-trick during a match against Napoli . Di Natale made his senior debut in late November 2002 against Turkey while Giovanni Trapattoni was still in charge of the national team . He won a few caps in later years though only participated in friendly games . In 2006 he regained a spot with the Azzurri , under new coach Roberto Donadoni , and was involved in the Euro 2008 qualification campaign . Di Natale netted a goal in each half , setting Italy en route to a hard-fought win over Ukraine in a qualifying match . He was then called up to Italy 's squad for UEFA Euro 2008 where he missed a crucial penalty during a quarter final penalty shoot out against Spain who went on to win 4 â `` 2 . The next season , after a knee injury against Montenegro on 28 March 2009 , Di Natale missed the 2009 Confederations Cup . In November , he captained the team for the first time and his good form earned him a call-up for the 2010 FIFA World Cup where he was given the number 10 shirt . On 24 June , he scored his first world cup goal against Slovakia at South Africa World Cup 2010 , the game ended 3 â `` 2 to Slovakia with Italy finishing bottom of Group F. Di Natale has a son , named Filippo and two daughters Alyssa and Angelina . He has a tattoo of his son 's name down his right arm , and a tattoo of his daughter 's name on the left . Most fans refer to him by the nickname TotÃ , a shortening of Antonio which is common use in Di Natale 's native Southern Italy .
Possible artificial fuels include radioactive isotopes , wood alcohol , grain alcohol , methane , synthetic gas , hydrogen gas ( H2 ) , cryogenic gas , and liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) . A crest is the point on a wave with the maximum value or upward displacement within a cycle . A trough is the opposite of a crest , so the minimum or lowest point in a cycle . When the crests and troughs of two sine waves of equal amplitude and frequency intersect or collide , while being in phase with each other , the result is called constructive interference and the magnitudes double ( above and below the line ) .
The Narrows is the tidal strait separating the boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn in New York City . It connects the Upper New York Bay and Lower New York Bay and forms the principal channel by which the Hudson River empties into the Atlantic Ocean . It has long been considered to be the maritime `` gateway '' to New York City and historically has been the most important entrance into the harbors of the Port of New York and New Jersey . The Narrows were most likely formed after deposition of the Harbor Hill Moraine about 18,000 years ago prior to the end of the last ice age . Previously Staten Island and Brooklyn were connected and the Hudson River emptied into the ocean through the present course of the Raritan River , by taking a more westerly course through parts of present day northern New Jersey , along the eastern side of the Watchung Mountains to Bound Brook , New Jersey and then on into the Atlantic Ocean via Raritan Bay . A build up of water in the Upper Bay allowed the river to break through to form the Narrows less than 12,000 to 13,000 years ago as it exists today ( see ; Waldman , 2000 ) . The first recorded European entrance into the Narrows was in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano , who set anchor in the strait and was greeted by a group of Lenape , who paddled out to meet him in the strait . In August 1776 , the British forces under William Howe on Staten Island undertook an amphibious operation across the Narrows and landed in Brooklyn , where they routed Washington 's Army at the Battle of Long Island . In 1964 , the Narrows were spanned by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge , the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time , and still the longest suspension bridge in the U.S. ( by length of the main span ) . Because the hyphen in the name is often omitted , the strait itself is sometimes erroneously called the `` Verrazano Narrows . ''
The battle led to the near complete annihilation of the entire Korean naval combat forces in a single engagement against the Japanese fleets which were simply unable to prevail against the Korean fleets in any of the previous engagements . Dustin James Brown ( born November 4 , 1984 ) is an American professional ice hockey player who plays for and captains the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) .

The next season saw a remarkable expansion in his roles , being placed on the scoring line with AnÅ 3\/4 e Kopitar . 2007 â `` 08 would prove to be a breakout season , with Dustin Brown posting new highs in goals and points , leading the Kings with 33 goals . On October 26 , 2007 , the Kings and Brown agreed to a six-year , $ 19.05 million contract extension that will keep him with the team until the 2014 â `` 2015 NHL season . During the World Championship tournament of 2008 , Dustin Brown received negative attention for intentionally injuring Finnish player Jussi Jokinen by aiming a hit towards his head after the end of a game . Brown was named as the Kingsâ captain on October 8 , 2008 . The fifteenth captain in franchise history , Brown , who was 23 at the time he was appointed captain , is the youngest captain and the first American-born captain in Kingsâ history .

A synchronous orbit is an orbit in which an orbiting body ( usually a satellite ) has a period equal to the average rotational period of the body being orbited ( usually a planet ) , and in the same direction of rotation as that body . A satellite in a synchronous orbit that is both equatorial and circular will appear to be suspended motionless above a point on the orbited planet 's equator . This is also known as a geostationary orbit . However , a synchronous orbit need not be equatorial ; nor circular . A body in a non-equatorial synchronous orbit will appear to oscillate north and south above a point on the planet 's equator , while a body in an elliptical orbit will appear to oscillate eastward and westward . As seen from the orbited body the combination of these two motions produces a figure-8 pattern called an analemma . Like many orbital terms synchronous orbits take on special names depending on the body being orbited . The following are some of the more common names . A synchronous orbit about the Earth that is circular and lies in the equatorial plane is called a geostationary orbit . The more general case , when the orbit is inclined to the Earth 's equator or is non-circular is called a geosynchronous orbit . The corresponding terms for synchronous orbits around the planet Mars are areostationary and areosynchronous orbits . An astronomical example is Pluto 's moon Charon . Much more commonly synchronous orbits are employed by artificial satellites used for communication , such as geostationary satellites . For natural satellites , which can attain a synchronous orbit only by tidally locking their parent body , it always goes in hand with synchronous rotation of the satellite . This is because the smaller body becomes tidally locked faster , and by the time a synchronous orbit is achieved , it has had a locked synchronous rotation for a long time already .
It is also connected to the satellite town of VÃ lklingen , where the old steel works were the first industrial monument to be declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994 â '' the VÃ lklinger HÃ 1\/4 tte . Saarlouis is a city in the Saarland , Germany , capital of the district of Saarlouis . In 2006 , the town had a population of 38,327 . Saarlouis , as the name implies , is located at the river Saar . It was built as a fortress in 1680 and named after Louis XIV of France . With the Treaties of Peace of Nijmegen in 1678\/79 , the Lorraine fell to France . In 1680 , Louis XIV of France gave order to build a fortification ( to defend the new French Eastern frontier ) on the banks of the river Saar which was called Sarre-Louis . France 's famous military engineer , SÃ bastien Le Prestre de Vauban , constructed the city , the plans were made by Thomas de Choisy , the city 's first Gouvenour . In 1683 , Louis XIV visited the fortress and granted arms . The coat of arms shows the rising sun and three Fleur-de-lis . The heraldic motto is Dissipat Atque Fovet : She ( the sun ) dispels ( the clouds ) and heats ( the earth ) . In 1697 , with the Treaty of Ryswick , most parts of Lorraine gained independence again , but Saarlouis and the surrounding areas remained a French exclave . During the French Revolution , the town was renamed Sarre-Libre , but it returned to its original name in 1810 . With the Treaty of Paris in 1815 , Saarlouis ( and the whole region later known as the Saargebiet ) became Prussian . After the First World War , French troops occupied Saarlouis . The Saargebiet became a protectorate of the League of Nations for a period of 15 years . In 1933 , a considerable number of anti-Nazi Germans fled to the Saar , as it was the only part of Germany left outside the Third Reich 's control . As a result , anti-Nazi groups campaigned heavily for the Saarland to remain under control of League of Nations as long as Adolf Hitler ruled Germany . However , long-held sentiments against France remained entrenched , with very few sympathizing openly with France . When the 15-year-term was over , a plebiscite was held in the territory on 13 January 1935 : 90.3 % of those voting wished to rejoin Germany . From 1936 till 1945 , Saarlouis was named as Saarlautern ( - lautern being a common ending of town and village names in Germany ) in an attempt by the Nazis to Germanize the town name . After World War II , the region ( then called the Saarland ) , was again occupied by France . In a plebiscite in 1955 , most of the people in the Saarland opted for the reunification with the Federal Republic of Germany , and on January 1 , 1957 , it became the 10th federal state of West Germany . In 1980 , Saarlouis celebrated its 300th anniversary . Even today , the ancient fortress dominates the city 's hexagonal floor plan . Beside the buildings made by Vauban , there are also some constructions left from the 19th century when the Prussians got control over the town . After 1887 , some parts of the fortress were slighted , but many buildings and places , e.g. the casemates , some barracks and the Great Market with the Commander 's Office and the Vauban island , a former ravelin with a memorial for Michel Ney can still be seen today . Saarlouis was famous for its nearby steel and iron ore production and its nearby mining facilities . Today , the Ford Motor Company is the city 's largest employer , producing the Ford Focus , Ford C-MAX , Ford Kuga , and the Ford F-Series pickup trucks . The plant in the Roederberg suburb is one of Ford 's most efficient facilities worldwide . The industrial port in Saarlouis-Roden is Germany 's 8th largest inland port . The city is located 20 minutes ' drive from France , and 45 minutes from Luxembourg City , the capital of Luxembourg .

In mathematics , especially in set theory , a set A is a subset of a set B if A is `` contained '' inside B. A and B may coincide . The relationship of one set being a subset of another is called inclusion or sometimes containment . Correspondingly , set B is a superset of A since all elements of A are also elements of B. If A is a subset of B , but A is not equal to B ( i.e. there exists at least one element of B not contained in A ) , then For any set S , the inclusion relation â is a partial order on the set of all subsets of S ( the power set of S ) . Some authors use the symbols â and â to indicate `` subset '' and `` superset '' respectively , instead of the symbols â and â , but with the same meaning . So for example , for these authors , it is true of every set A that A â A. Other authors prefer to use the symbols â and â to indicate proper subset and superset , respectively , in place of â and â This usage makes â and â analogous to the inequality symbols â and ( . For example , if x â y then x may be equal to y , or maybe not , but if x ( y , then x definitely does not equal y , but is strictly less than y. Similarly , using the '' â means proper subset '' convention , if A â B , then A may or may not be equal to B , but if A â B , then A is definitely not equal to B. Inclusion is the canonical partial order in the sense that every partially ordered set ( X , ) is isomorphic to some collection of sets ordered by inclusion . The ordinal numbers are a simple exampleâ '' if each ordinal n is identified with the set ( n ) of all ordinals less than or equal to n , then a â b if and only if ( a ) â ( b ) . For the power set of a set S , the inclusion partial order is ( up to an order isomorphism ) the Cartesian product of k = S ( the cardinality of S ) copies of the partial order on for which 0 1 , s2 , â , s ` k -RCB- and associating with each subset T â S ( which is to say with each element of 2S ) the k-tuple from k of which the ith coordinate is 1 if and only if s ' i is a member of T.
The River Teifi forms the boundary between the counties of Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire in south-west Wales for most of its 75 mile length , flowing into the sea below the town of Cardigan . The catchment of the river is estimated to be 1,008 square kilometres yielding an average flow at Glan Teifi of 31 mÂ \/ s. The maximum recorded flow ( up till 1970 ) was 269.7 mÂ \/ s on 17 December 1965 . The average rainfall varies from 1552 mm in the upper catchment to 1,176 mm in the lower catchment . The Teifi has its source in Llyn Teifi , one of several lakes known collectively as the Teifi Pools . These are situated towards the north of the county of Ceredigion . This wide area of Mid-Wales , with a very sparse population , is part of what is sometimes called the `` desert of Wales '' . The river flows past Strata Florida Abbey and then through Pontrhydfendigaid before reaching the main river valley floor . Here it passes through one of the great raised mires of Britain , Gors Goch Glan Teifi , also known as Tregaron Bog . Over the next 30 miles , the Teifi meanders generally south-west in a gentle arc , passing through the towns and villages of Tregaron , Llanddewi Brefi , Cwmann , Lampeter , Llanybydder , Llandysul , Newcastle Emlyn , Cenarth , Llechryd and finally Cardigan . The river becomes tidal below Llechryd and descends into Cardigan through the steep-sided Cilgerran Gorge . Below Cardigan , the river broadens into a wide estuary , passing the seaside resort of Poppit Sands before finally entering the sea in Cardigan Bay . The Teifi and its tributaries are underlain by ancient Ordovician and Silurians mudstones which have been extensively glaciated during the ice ages . The resultant landform is one of gently rolling hills supporting a range of agriculture in which dairy and sheep farming dominate . Ceredigion had the reputation of supplying London with its milk in the 19th century . The landscapes of the Teifi valley are very attractive and the Teifi is considered by many to be one of the most beautiful rivers in Wales . Teifi Pools , the source of the Teifi , are a series of small lakes left by past glacial activity . The lakes are upland and acid in nature . Some have been enlarged by damming and now provide a source of drinking water . The very extensive raised mire above Tregaron acts as a huge sponge at the head of the river and evens out extremes in flow . Rapids and waterfalls are uncommon but the examples at Henllan and , especially at Cenarth , are noteworthy and have been extensively photographed and painted because of the beauty of the landscape . The gorge between Llechryd and Cilgerran has a special brooding quality . Few visitors stray into the gorge and the river winds its way almost silently between the densely wooded sides with their distinctive under-storey flora of sedges . The Teifi valley has been inhabited since pre-history . There are many remains of Iron Age and Stone age man including Cromlechs ( burial chambers ) and standing stones . The remains of a medieval abbey stand at Strata Florida with some excellent examples of encaustic tiles on the floors . The river flows near to the Lampeter campus of the University of Wales , Trinity Saint David , its predecessor , the University of Wales , Lampeter ( est . 1822 ) having been the oldest university established in Wales . Between Cenarth and Cardigan , there is an ancient tradition of fishing and travel using coracles -- very simple light-weight boats made of bent sticks covered with waterproofed hide or skins . These are paddled by a single oar used at the front of the craft which requires great skill . The principal use for coracles is for salmon fishing using nets . This form of fishing is now very tightly controlled and the right to fish in this way is passed down from father to son . There is also an age-old tradition of illegal salmon and sea-trout fishing in the lower Teifi . The Teifi Valley is home of the Teifi Valley Railway , a 2-foot gauge steam railway .

The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education ( PASSHE ) is the largest provider of higher education in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a large public university system in the United States . It is the tenth-largest university system in the United States and 43rd largest in the world . The system comprises 14 state-owned schools , all of which are NCAA Division II members by virtue of being members of the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference . PASSHE institutions are the only colleges and universities in Pennsylvania that are publicly owned and governed , but they are not the only ones that receive public funding . To this point , the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education should not be confused with Pennsylvania 's Commonwealth System of Higher Education . The Normal School Act of 1857 was passed on the last day of session on 20 May 1857 . Its passage created 12 normal school districts in the state in which to establish private corporations answerable to the State Superintendent of Common Schools . Afterward , the School Code of 1911 mandated that the Commonwealth purchase all the normal schools . The normal schools evolved from state normal schools , to state teacher 's colleges , to state colleges . Act 188 , which was signed into law on November 12 , 1982 and came into effect on July 1 , 1983 , established the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education , and converted those state colleges into universities . PASSHE universities also operate four branch campuses . The Office of the Chancellor is situated in the capital city of Harrisburg at the Dixon University Center . As established by the founding legislation , Act 188 of 1982 , the primary mission of the State System of Higher Education `` is the provision of instruction for undergraduate and graduate students to and beyond the Master 's degree in the liberal arts and sciences , and in the applied fields , including the teaching profession . '' Additionally , the purpose of PASSHE is `` to provide high quality education at the lowest possible cost to students . '' A 20-member Board of Governors oversees the system . Additional power is vested in the Councils of Trustees at the constituent universities . Board of Governor 's membership includes : four state legislators , three students , the Governor of the Commonwealth ( or a designee ) , the Pennsylvania Secretary of Education ( or a designee ) , and 11 citizens appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state senate . The Board of Governors sets general policy for PASSHE . It also appoints the chancellor , who serves as the system 's chief executive officer , and the university presidents . The chancellor is an ex-officio member of each university 's Council of Trustees . Almost 120,000 undergraduate and graduate , part-time and full-time , students attend PASSHE universities . Nearly 90 percent are Pennsylvania residents and 64 percent remain in Pennsylvania after graduation . Minority enrollment also is at an all-time high . A record total of 13,860 minority studentsâ '' nearly 12 percent of the total student populationâ '' are taking classes at PASSHE universities . There are more than 617,000 PASSHE alumni , including more than 454,000 who live and work in Pennsylvania . The total university campus comprises approximately 4,700 acres ( 19 kmÂ ) . A total of 862 buildings with nearly 25 million square feet ( 2.3 kmÂ ) house classrooms , residences , administrative offices , and student support services . PASSHE employs more than 12,169 professional and support staff , most covered by collective bargaining agreements , making it the 16th largest employer in the commonwealth . The various libraries are connected through the cooperative Keystone Library Network . Tuition at System universities is $ 5,804 per year for Pennsylvanian undergraduate students and from $ 8,706 to $ 14,510 per year for nonresident students . The graduate student tuition is $ 6,966 per year for Pennsylvanians , and $ 11,146 per year for out-of-commonwealth students . Pennsylvanian students also pay a $ 232 annual instructional technology fee , which is $ 350 for nonresidents .

Casio Computer Co. , Ltd. is a multinational electronic devices manufacturing company founded in 1946 , with its headquarters in Shibuya , Tokyo , Japan . Casio is best known for its calculators , audio equipment , PDAs , cameras , musical instruments , and watches . In 1957 Casio released the world 's first entirely electric compact calculator . Casio was established in April 1946 by Tadao Kashio , an engineer specializing in fabrication technology . Kashio 's first major product was the yubiwa pipe , a finger ring that would hold a cigarette , allowing the wearer to smoke the cigarette down to its nub while also leaving the wearer 's hands free . Japan was impoverished immediately following World War II so cigarettes were valuable , and the invention was a success . After seeing the electric calculators at the first Business Show in Ginza , Tokyo in 1949 , Kashio and his younger brothers used their profits from the yubiwa pipe to develop their own calculators . Most of the calculators at that time worked using gears and could be operated by hand using a crank or using a motor ( see adding machine ) . Kashio possessed some knowledge of electronics , and set out to make a calculator using solenoids . The desk-sized calculator was finished in 1954 and was Japan 's first electro-mechanical calculator . One of the central innovations of the calculator was its adoption of the 10-key number pad ; at that time other calculators were using a `` full keypad '' , which meant that each place in the number ( 1s , 10s , 100s , etc. . . ) had nine keys . Another innovation was the use of a single display window instead of the three display windows ( one for each argument and one for the answer ) used in other calculators . In 1957 Casio released the Model 14-A , sold for 485,000 yen , the world 's first all-electric compact calculator , which was based on relay technology . 1957 also marked the establishment of Casio Computer Co. . Ltd. In the 1980s , its budget electronic instruments and home keyboards gained huge popularity . The company also became well known for the wide variety and innovation of its wristwatches . It was one of the earliest manufacturers of quartz crystal watches , both digital and analog . It also began selling calculator watches during this time . It was one of the first manufacturers of watches that could display the time in many different time zones and of watches with temperature , atmospheric-pressure , altitude , and even GPS position displays . A number of notable digital cameras firsts have been made by Casio , including the first consumer digital camera with an LCD screen , the first consumer 3 megapixel camera , the first true ultra-compact model , and the first digital camera to incorporate ceramic lens technology . Today , Casio is most commonly known for durable , large sized watches . Especially popular are its dual function ( LCD and analog ) watches , some of which , called Wave Ceptors , receive radio signals daily from an atomic clock to keep accurate time . Other products include calculators , watches , cash registers , illuminators , digital cameras ( Exilim Series ) , film cameras , laptop and sub-notebook computers , mobile phones , electronic keyboards , PDAs ( E-Data Bank ) , electronic dictionaries , Digital Diaries , computer printers , clocks , and portable televisions .
The Class 112 and Class 113 DMUs utilised the standard Cravens body used on Class 105s but had a single Rolls-Royce engine rated at 238 h per car , all of which formed into ` power twins ' - two car sets with both vehicles powered . There were two batches built , the first 50 vehicles ( 25 sets ) had standard mechanical transmission via a gearbox and were allocated the Class 112 . The second batch of 50 cars ( 25 sets ) had hydraulic transmission , and became Class 113s . The cars were built for services in the LMR Central Division and in the Liverpool - St Helens area , where the gradients in the Lancashire & Yorkshire area required more power . Both types also spent some time working from Cricklewood . The gross weight of a set with all seats occupied was approximately 70 tons , giving 6.8 h per ton . Empty , it was 8.1 hp\/ton , which compared favourably with 5.7 hp\/ton that the Cravens power\/trailer had . All 112s and 113s were withdrawn by the end of 1969 , and none survive .
Masaoka Shiki , the pen-name of Masaoka Noboru ( æ # å å ) was a Japanese author , poet , literary critic , and journalist in Meiji period Japan . Shiki is generally regarded as the major figure in the development of modern haiku poetry and also played an important role in revitalizing tanka poetry . Shiki , or rather Tsunenori ( å è ) as he was originally named , was born in Matsuyama city in Iyo province ( present day Ehime prefecture ) to a samurai class family of modest means . As as a child , was called Tokoronosuke ( å ä å ) ; in adolescence , his name was changed to Noboru ( å ) . His father , Tsunenao , was a low-ranking official , and his mother , Yae , was the eldest daughter of Å hara Kanzan , a teacher at the clan school . Shiki lost his father when he was five . Shiki , or rather , Noboru , attended Matsuyama Middle School , where Itagaki Taisuke , a leader of a democratic movement , had served for a time as principal ( though he was forced to resign in 1879 his influence remained strong ) . In 1883 , an uncle arranged for Noboru to come to Tokyo , where he enrolled in a preparatory school . He entered the literature department of Imperial University in January 1890 . Shiki was a strong advocate of modernization of Japanese poetry , introducing the terms haiku to replace stand-alone hokku , and tanka to replace the 31-mora waka . Shiki suffered from tuberculosis much of his life . In 1889 , after coughing up blood , he adopted the pen-name of `` Shiki '' . His illness was severely aggravated by a stint as a war correspondent with the Imperial Japanese Army during the First Sino-Japanese War . Upon return from military service in 1895 he convalesced at Natsume SÅ seki 's house in Matsuyama , but he realized that he was terminally ill. . He continued to write vigorously , but was largely bed-ridden by 1898 . He kept a series of journals dated 1901-1902 , in which he described his physical deterioration and the progress of his illness in clinical detail . These journals also contain numerous tanka and haiku , which occurred to him while he was writing . He died in Tokyo on 19 September 1902 . Shiki is today often credited with single-handedly revitalizing the poetry forms of haiku and tanka . Although his ideas and theories were regarded as revolutionary by his contemporaries , he mostly remained within the bounds of the traditionally established â rulesâ and formats , unlike his more radical free verse successors . His work has an austerity , and a freshness that remains popular today . He is now regarded as one of the four great masters of haiku , along with BashÅ , Buson , and Issa . Shiki also played baseball in his early days and entered Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 2002 .

She was subsequently nominated by the DPP to be a candidate in the 2004 legislative election and was elected as legislator-at-large . On January 26 , 2006 , Tsai was appointed to the post of Vice President of the Executive Yuan , a position commonly referred to as Vice Premier .

She then served as the chair of TaiMedBiologics , a biotechnology company based in Taiwan . In Kuomintang candidate Ma Ying-jeou 's search for his running mate for the 2008 ROC presidential election , Tsai , a DPP member , was surprisingly suggested .

Tsai has been impartial in light of Chen 's acknowledgement . On April 25 , 2010 , Tsai participated in a televised debate against President and Kuomintang chairman Ma Ying-jeou over a proposed trade deal with China . While President Ma believed that the agreement with mainland China , called the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement ( ECFA ) , would increase Taiwanese exports to China and lower unemployment rates , Tsai said it `` will force Taiwan to open up for cheap Chinese exports eventually '' and certain domestic industries will be harmed by the mainland trade invasion . Tsai also said that the pact `` will make Taiwan lose its independence in cross-strait relations and become a Chinese parasite '' and that Taiwan should negotiate with China under the World Trade Organization , which would offer more trade protections . Under Tsai 's leadership , along with some of KMT 's unpopular policies , the DDP has been regaining momentum in elections since 2009 , after the major defeats from 2006 to 2008 . On March 11th , 2011 , Tsai Ing-wen officially announced to run for the presidential nomination of the Democratic Progressive Party . The 5th-time direct presidential election will be held in early 2012 .

Since 1973 the company has been the leading producer of medium and heavy-duty diesel trucks in Japan . It is a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation . The company traces its roots back to the founding of Tokyo Gas Industry Company in 1910 .

Four years later , the company changed its name to Diesel Motor Industry Co. , Ltd. , which would eventually become Isuzu Motors Limited . The following year ( 1942 ) , the new entity of Hino Heavy Industry Co. , Ltd. spun itself out from Diesel Motor Industry Co. , Ltd. , and the Hino name was born . Following the end of World War II , the company had to stop producing large diesel engines for marine applications , and with the signing of the treaty , the company dropped the `` Heavy '' from its name and formally concentrated on the heavy-duty trailer-trucks , buses and diesel engines markets , as Hino Industry Co. , Ltd. . The company took its name from the location of its headquarters in Hino city within Tokyo prefecture . To sharpen its marketing focus to customers , in 1948 , the company added the name `` Diesel '' to become Hino Diesel Industry Co. , Ltd. In 1953 , Hino entered the private car market , by manufacturing Renaults under licence , and in 1961 it started building its own Contessa 900 sedan with an 893cc rear-mounted engine . The Italian stylist Giovanni Michelotti redesigned the Contessa line in 1964 with a 1300cc rear-mounted engine . Fed by two SU type carburettors , this developed 60 hp ( 44 kW ) in the sedan and 70 hp ( 51 kW ) in the coupÃ version . However , Hino ceased private car production very quickly in 1967 after joining the Toyota group . Hino Trucks are also assembled in The Republic of Ireland by J Harris on the Naas\/Nangor Roads . Hino motors sells hybrid versions of some vehicles and plans include further improvement and expanded sales of hybrid system . Hino is testing a new kind of hybrid electric vehicle without a plug ( outboard charging electric vehicle ) . The energy in the batteries does n't come from a plug and charging point , it comes from a wireless charging system built into the road . A series of induction coils built into the road resonate energy at a certain frequency , like radio waves . The bus is able to capture those waves and store the energy in its batteries . The first generation Ranger KL spawned into KM , KR , and other variants . In Australia . Hino has competed in the Dakar Rally since 1991 with a Ranger FT 4WD truck driven by the Japanese rally driver , Yoshimasa Sugawara . Hino has always finished in the Top 10 in the Camion Category , and 1-2-3 overall in the 1997 event . Hino also sells the European truck Scania R420 in Japan , into an agreement with the Swedish brand .

The United Nations Development Fund for Women , commonly known as UNIFEM ( from the French `` Fonds de dÃ veloppement des Nations unies pour la femme '' ) was established in December 1976 originally as the Voluntary Fund for the United Nations Decade for Women in the International Women 's Year . Its first director was Dr. Margaret Snyder , Ph. D. . It provides financial and technical assistance to innovative programs and strategies that promote womenâ s human rights , political participation and economic security . Since 1976 it has supported womenâ s empowerment and gender equality through its program offices and links with womenâ s organizations in the major regions of the world . Its work on gender responsive budgets began in 1996 in Southern Africa and has expanded to include East Africa , Southeast Asia , South Asia , Central America and the Andean region . It has worked to increase awareness throughout the UN system of gender responsive budgets as a tool to strengthen economic governance in all countries . HRH Princess Basma bint Talal of Jordan was appointed UNIFEM Goodwill Ambassador in 1996 . On January 26 , 2006 UNIFEM nominated Nicole Kidman as its goodwill ambassador . The current Executive Director of UNIFEM is InÃ s Alberdi . In January 2011 , Unifem was merged into UN Women , a composite entity of the UN , along with International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women ( INSTRAW ) , Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues ( OSAGI ) , and Division for the Advancement of Women ( DAW ) .
Narowal District is a district in the province of Punjab of Pakistan . Narowal city is the capital of the district . Narowal District is divided into three tehsils : Narowal , Shakargarh and Zafarwal . Before the independence of Pakistan in 1947 , Shakargarh town was the headquarters of Shakargarh Tehsil , which was a subdivision of the Gurdaspur District of British India . Under the Radcliffe Award , the tehsil of Shakargarh was transferred to Pakistan and attached to Sialkot District . On July 1 , 1991 , Narowal and Shakargarh were removed from Sialkot District to form Narowal District . The district is bounded on the northwest by Sialkot District , on the north by Kathua district of Indian occupied Kashmir , on the southeast by the contested Pathankot tehsil of Gurdaspur district ( Republic of India ) , on the south by Amritsar district ( Republic of India ) and on the southwest by Sheikhupura District in Pakistan . The total area of the district is approximately 2,337 square kilometres . Prior to the creation of Zafarwal Tehsil in July 2009 , Narowal Tehsil occupied 1,065 square kilometres while the remaining area ( 1,272 square kilometres ) fell in Shakargarh Tehsil . According to the 1998 census of Pakistan , Narowal District 's population was 1,256,097 , of which only 12.11 % were urban .

The AlalÄ or Hawaiian Crow ( Corvus hawaiiensis ) is a species of bird in the crow family , Corvidae . It is about the size of the Carrion Crow at 48 - in length , but with more rounded wings and a much thicker bill . It has soft , brownish-black plumage and long , bristly throat feathers ; the feet , legs and bill are black . Some Native Hawaiians consider the alalÄ an aumakua ( family god ) . The alalÄ is now extinct in the wild . Prior to this , the species was found only in the western and southeastern parts of the island of Hawaii . It inhabited dry and mesic forests on the slopes of Mauna Loa and HualÄ lai at elevations of 300 - . Å hia lehua ( Metrosideros polymorpha ) and koa ( Acacia koa ) are important tree species in its habitat . Extensive understory cover is necessary to protect the ` alala from predation by io ( Buteo solitarius ) , Hawaiian Hawk . Nesting sites receive 600 - of annual rainfall . Fossil remains indicate that it previously was relatively abundant on all the main islands , along with four other extinct crow species . The species is known for strong flying ability and resourcefulness , and the reasons for its extinction are not fully understood . It is thought that introduced diseases , such as Toxoplasma gondii , avian malaria ( Plasmodium relictum ) , and fowlpox , were probably a significant factor in the species ' decline . The varied diet of the omnivorous alalÄ is dominated by eggs and nestlings , invertebrates , and fruit ; nectar , flowers , carrion are minor components . AlalÄ s will pry bark off trees and eat the insects found underneath . Ieie ( Freycinetia arborea ) vines are an important fruit source , although the birds are not normally seen in wet forests , where ieie density is highest . The alalÄ has a call described variously as a two-toned caw and as a screech with lower tones added , similar to a cat 's meow . It also makes a ca-wak sound , has a complex , burbling song , and makes a variety of other sounds as well . The last two known wild individuals of this species disappeared in 2002 ; the species is now classified as Extinct in the Wild by the IUCN Red List . While some 78 individuals remain ( as of July 2010 ) in two captive breeding facilities operated by the San Diego Zoo , attempts to reintroduce captive-bred birds into the wild have been hampered by predation by the Hawaiian Hawk ( Buteo solitarius ) , which is listed as Near Threatened . On April 16 , 2009 , The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced a five year plan to spend more than $ 14 million to prevent the extinction of the Hawaiian Crow through protection of habitats and management of threats to the species .

The nasal septum separates the left and right airways in the nose , dividing the two nostrils . It is depressed by the Depressor septi nasi muscle . The fleshy external end of the nasal septum is sometimes also called columella . The nasal septum can depart from the center line of the nose in a condition is known as a deviated septum due to trauma . However , it is normal to have a slight deviation to one side . The septum generally stays in the midline until about the age of 7 , at which point it will frequently deviate to the right . A perforated nasal septum can be caused by an ulcer , trauma due to an inserted object , excessive nose-picking , long-term exposure to welding fumes , or cocaine abuse . There is a procedure that can be of help to those suffering from perforated septum . A silicone button can be inserted in the hole to close the open sore . An operation to the nasal septum is known as a septoplasty . The nasal septum can be affected by both benign ( fibroma , inflammatory hemangioma of the nasal septum - `` bleeding polyp '' etc. ) and malign tumors ( squamous cell carcinoma , esthesioneuroblastoma etc. ) The inferior part of the nasal septum can be pierced , usually through the soft tissue but the piercing can also transverse ( partially ) the cartilage of the septum .

Ununseptium is the temporary name of the chemical element with temporary symbol Uus and atomic number 117 . It is the latest element to have a claim of discovery , with six atoms having been detected by a joint Russiaâ `` US collaboration at Dubna , Moscow Oblast , Russia , in 2009 â `` 10 . Although it is placed as the heaviest member of the halogen family , there is no experimental evidence that the chemical properties of ununseptium match those of the lighter members like iodine or astatine and theoretical analysis suggests there may be some notable differences . Just six atoms were synthesized of two neighbouring isotopes , neither of which decayed to known isotopes of lighter elements . Their results were published on 9 April 2010 in the journal Physical Review Letters . The element with atomic number 117 is historically known as eka-astatine . The name ununseptium is a systematic element name , used as a placeholder until the discovery is acknowledged by the IUPAC , and the IUPAC decides on a name . Usually , the name suggested by the discoverer ( s ) is chosen . According to current guidelines from IUPAC , the ultimate name for all new elements should end in '' - ium '' , which means the name for ununseptium may end in - ium , not - ine , even if ununseptium turns out to be a halogen . Scientists at Dubna are continuing their study of the 249Bk + 48Ca reaction in order to attempt a first chemical study of ununtrium . The team at the GSI in Darmstadt , recently acknowledged as the discoverers of copernicium have begun experiments aiming towards a synthesis of ununseptium . The GSI have indicated that if they are unable to acquire any 249Bk from the United States , which is likely given the situation regarding the attempt in Russia , they will study the reaction 244Pu ( 51V , xn ) instead , or possibly 243Am ( 50Ti , xn ) . = = = = Target-projectile combinations leading to Z = 117 compound nucleiHot fusion249Bk ( 48Ca , xn ) 297-xUus ( x = 3,4 ) Theoretical calculationsEvaporation residue cross sectionsDecay characteristicsChemical propertiesExtrapolated chemical properties = = = Certain chemical properties , such as bond lengths , are predicted to differ from what one would expect based on periodic trends from the lighter halogens ( because of relativistic effects ) .

This is the central guideline for recent year articles . Recent year articles ( e.g. , 2009 , 2010 ) are among the most heavily edited on Wikipedia . Since so many events happen in a year , not all events will be notable enough to merit inclusion on the page . Such events may be better placed on a subpage . That an event is important to an individual editor , or even to a particular society or nation , is insufficient ground for its inclusion . The event must have a demonstrated , international significance . The fact that other year articles may include events which break this set of guidelines is not a valid reason to do so for another event . Any of the standards set below can be overruled by a consensus to ignore those standards in a given case . The lead section of a year article should be approximately two paragraphs in length ( while the maximum for any article is four ) . 2010 ( MMX ) is a common year that started on a Friday and is the current year . In the Gregorian calendar , it is the 2010th year of the Common Era or the Anno Domini designation ; the 10th year of the 3rd millennium and of the 21st century ; and the 1st of the 2010s decade . The second paragraph contains a bulleted list of formal and international designations the year has received . To be considered notable enough for inclusion , these designations must have their own Wikipedia articles ( e.g. , International Year of Planet Earth , European Year of Equal Opportunities for All ) . The lack of an article does not mean that a designation is insignificant , but rather that it does not demonstrably meet Wikipedia 's general notability guidelines . The same editor ( s ) may create a designation 's article , and then add that designation to the year article 's second paragraph . However , it is incumbent upon this or these editor ( s ) to ensure that the created article is suitable for an encyclopedia and does not violate any of Wikipedia 's policies . The body of a recent year article takes the format presented just below ; the body 's contents are subject to the inclusion and exclusion criteria that are set forth further down . Depending on whether a given year , or a given part of it , has arrived , or on other factors , some sections , subsections , or entries might not apply to that year 's article . Double-brackets indicate that the contents must be Wikilinked . New events added must receive independent news reporting from three different continents on the event . This is a minimum requirement for inclusion . Events which are not cited at all , or are not Wikilinked to an article devoted to the event , may be removed . Sporting events which are either annual or are not international ( more than one continent ) do not belong on the main year page , but on the year in sports page ( e.g. 2009 in sports ) . Valid sporting events may include : Any event not covered above must gain a consensus for inclusion on the talk page before being added and may be better placed in the year 's sports article . National elections are not usually included unless they represent a significant change in the country ( e.g. , a nation 's first election ) . Some elections gain international significance for other reasons and this can be demonstrated through several international news sources . Regular and ordinary shifts in power within the United Nations and European Union are also not sufficiently notable . Most legislation passed in the year will not qualify unless it is of international significance . Disasters of a global or near-global significance may be added . The importance of these disasters can be demonstrated through various international news sources . High death counts do not necessarily merit inclusion into the article . Likewise , assassinations or other similarly serious crimes can be listed if international relevance is demonstrated . Events such as suicide-murders , kidnappings , school shootings , etc. do not necessarily qualify unless especially significant . Births are only to be included if there are Wikipedia articles in at least ten languages about the individual in question . William Shakespeare , for example , has several non-English articles on him , listed on the left sidebar . This is a minimum requirement for unexplained inclusion . Although inclusion may then be automatic , it will not necessarily be permanent . Any entry may be contested by any editor who finds the entry undue ; and , pending discussion , many names might not merit inclusion , even if they have enough non-English articles . The same criteria apply to deaths as to births . Film releases , Academy Awards , video game releases , and the like should always be added onto their topic pages ( e.g. , 2009 in video gaming , 2001 in film , 2006 in television ) and never on the main years ' pages . Films , games , etc. that are set in a given yearâ '' regardless of their release dates , provided that the release and setting are not so close in time as to coincide only triviallyâ '' should be added to a separate `` In fiction '' article for that year .
Upsilon ( uppercase Î , lowercase Ï ; , Ã psilon ) is the 20th letter of the Greek alphabet . Â In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 400 . It is derived from the Phoenician waw . The name of the letter is pronounced in Modern Greek , and in English , juË pË saÉ lÉ n , or Ë juË psÉ lÉ n . It is occasionally called `` ypsilon '' ( \/ Ë É psÉ lÉ n \/ ) in English after its rendering in Latin , where the Greek upsilon corresponded with the letter Y. In early Greek and modern physics it is pronounced Â oo . In Classical Greek , it was pronounced like French u or German Ã 1\/4 , â '' a sound that is not found in most dialects of English . This was the case at least until the year 1030AD . In Modern Greek it is pronounced like continental i or English ee , , and in diphthongs , ( f ) or ( v ) . In ancient Greek it occurred in both long and short versions , but this distinction has been lost in Modern Greek . As an initial letter in Classical Greek it always carried the rough breathing ( equivalent to h ) as reflected in the many Greek-derived English words , such as those that begin with hyper - and hypo - . This rough breathing was derived from an older pronunciation which used a sibilant instead ; this sibilant was not lost in Latin , giving rise to such cognates as super - ( for hyper - ) and sub - ( for hypo - ) . Upsilon participated as the second element in falling diphthongs , which have subsequently developed in various ways : for instance after alpha or epsilon it is pronounced ( f ) or ( v ) . The usage of Y in Latin dates back to the first century BC . It was used to transcribe loanwords from Greek , so it was not a native sound of Latin and was usually pronounced \/ u \/ or \/ i \/ . The latter pronunciation was the most common in the Classical period and was used by most people except the educated ones . The Roman Emperor Claudius proposed introducing a new letter into the Latin alphabet to transcribe the so-called sonus medius ( a short vowel before labial consonants ) , but in inscriptions was sometimes used for Greek upsilon instead . The name of the letter was originally just Ï ( y ; also called hy , hence `` hyoid '' , meaning `` y-shaped '' ) . It changed to Ï Ï Î Î '' Ï Î 1\/2 , ( u psilon , meaning ` simple u ' ) to distinguish it from Î Ï , which had come to have the same ( y ) pronunciation . Â Four letters of the Latin alphabet arose from it : V and Y and , much later , U and W. In the Cyrillic alphabet , the letters U ( Ð # , Ñ ) and Izhitsa ( Ñ , Ñ ) arose from it . In some languages ( most notably German ) , the name upsilon , ( Ã 1\/4 ppsilon ) is used to refer to the Latin letter Y as well as the Greek letter . Upsilon is known as Pythagoras ' letter , or the Samian letter , becauseÂ Pythagoras used it as an emblem of the path of virtue or vice . As the Roman writer Persius wrote in Satire III : : : `` and the letter which spreads out into Pythagorean branches has pointed out to you the steep path which rises on the right .

Murasaki Shikibu ( ç `` å 1\/4 é ; c. 973 -- c. 1014 or 1025 ) , or Lady Murasaki as she is often known in English , was a Japanese novelist , poet , and a maid of honor of the imperial court during the Heian period of Japan . She is best known as the author of The Tale of Genji , written in Japanese between about 1000 and 1008 , which is the earliest known novel in human history . `` Murasaki Shikibu '' was not her real name , which is unknown . Some scholars have postulated that her given name might have been Fujiwara Takako , recorded as a name of a lady-in-waiting ranked shÅ ji on the 29th day of the 1st month , KankÅ 4 ( February 19 , 1007 ) according to MidÅ Kampaku Ki , a diary written by Fujiwara no Michinaga , although this theory has not been supported by many others . Her own diary , The Murasaki Shikibu Diary , states that she was nicknamed `` Murasaki '' ( `` Violet '' ) at court , after a character in The Tale of Genji . `` Shikibu '' refers to her father 's position in the Bureau of Ceremony ( shikibu-sh Å ) . Lady Murasaki Shikibu was born about 973 in Kyoto , Japan . She was born in a family of minor nobility and a member of the northern branch of the Fujiwara clan . Murasaki 's mother died when she was a child , so she was raised , contrary to customs of the time , by her father Fujiwara no Tametoki , a scholar and officer of the imperial court . During Heian-era Japan , couples lived separately and children were raised by the mother and her family . Also contrary to customs of the time , her father gave her a male education . Men were taught kanji and classical Chinese literature as the requisite culture , while women were taught kana and poetry . Her father praised her intelligence and ability , but lamented that she was `` born a woman '' . She was married in her early 20s and had one child , Daini no Sanmi , who was a poet in her own right . At the royal court , she was the lady-in-waiting for Empress Shoshi ( Akiko ) and may have been hired by Fujiwara no Michinaga to serve the Empress herself . Murasaki died either in 1014 , when records show that her father suddenly returned to Kyoto from his governor 's mansion , or between 1025 and 1031 , when she would have been in her mid-50s , fairly old by Heian standards . Three works are attributed to Murasaki , the most important being The Tale of Genji . The Murasaki Shikibu Diary and The Murasaki Shikibu Collection were arranged and published posthumously . The collection is a compilation of 128 poems written by Murasaki . Murasaki is considered one of the greatest writers of Japanese literature . Statues in her honor have been erected throughout Japan , her works are a staple part of the education curriculum in Japan . The 2000 yen note was issued in commemoration to her and her greatest epic work , The Tale of Genji . She was a lady-in-waiting for Emperor Ichijo at the time . After his death , she became the lady-in-waiting for the Empress Akiko . A fictionalized biography of Murasaki called The Tale of Murasaki : A Novel was written by Liza Dalby . Another fictionalized biography of Murasaki Shikibu is an Italian novel by Gabriella Magrini : Mille Autunni , vita di Murasaki Dama di Corte , Edizione Frassinelli 1985 ; translated into French under the title La dame de Kyoto , Editions Belfond , 1987 , ISBN 2 7144 1973 9 . A fictitious descendant of Lady Murasaki is a major character in the Thomas Harris novel and subsequent horror film Hannibal Rising .

The North Island ( MÄ ori : Te Ika-a-M Ä ui ) is one of the two main islands of New Zealand , separated from the much less populous South Island by Cook Strait . The island is 113729 k in area , making it the world 's 14th-largest island . It has a population of Twelve cities are in the North Island : Auckland , New Plymouth , Tauranga , Gisborne , Napier , Hamilton , Hastings , Palmerston North , Rotorua , Wanganui , Whangarei and Wellington , the capital , located at the southern extremity of the island . Approximately % of New Zealand 's population lives in the North Island . Although the island has been known as the North Island for many years , the New Zealand Geographic Board has found that , along with the South Island , it has no official name . The board intends to make North Island the island 's official name , along with an alternative MÄ ori name . Although several MÄ ori names have been used , Maori Language Commissioner Erima Henare sees Te Ika-a-M Ä ui as the most likely choice . The definite article is used with the names of the North and South islands , as the North Island and the South Island , like the North Sea and the Western World , but unlike Rangitoto Island or West Point . Maps , headings or tables and adjectival expressions use North Island , whereas the North Island is used after a preposition or before or after a verb , e.g. my mother lives in the North Island , the North Island is smaller than the South Island , or I 'm visiting the North Island . When specifying that the island is where a place , person , or object is located , it is normal to use the word in rather than on , for example Hamilton is in the North Island . According to MÄ ori mythology , the North and South Islands of New Zealand arose through the actions of the demigod MÄ ui . MÄ ui and his brothers were fishing from their canoe ( the South Island ) when he caught a great fish and pulled it from the sea . While he was not looking his brothers fought over the fish and chopped it up . This great fish became the North Island and thus a MÄ ori name for the North Island is Te Ika-a-M Ä ui ( The Fish of MÄ ui ) . The mountains and valleys are said to have been formed as a result of MÄ ui 's brothers ' hacking at the fish . Until the early 20th Century , an alternative MÄ ori name for the North Island was Aotearoa . In present MÄ ori usage , Aotearoa is a collective name for New Zealand as a whole . The sub-national GDP of the North Island was estimated at US$ 102.863 billion in 2003 , 79 % of New Zealand 's national GDP . North Island has an extensive flora and bird population , with numerous National Parks and other protected areas . Nine local government regions cover the North Island and all its adjacent islands and territorial waters . Smaller urban areas are found on the List of towns in New Zealand , as are components of larger metropolitan area .

Ralph Fletcher ( born March 17 , 1953 ) is a writer of children 's picture books , young-adult fiction and poetry as well as an educational consultant who has also written books for both children and professional educators on the craft of writing . Ralph Fletcher grew up in Marshfield , Massachusetts . He is the oldest of nine children . Each of his parents was one of eight children . He received his B.A. degree from Dartmouth College in 1975 and his M.F.A degree in writing from Columbia University in 1983 . In college he participated in foreign study programs in Tonga in the South Pacific and Sierra Leone , South Africa . After receiving his masters degree , Ralph worked in New York City classrooms as part of the Teacher College writing project . Fletcher currently lives in Lee , New Hampshire . He is married to JoAnn Portalupi with whom he has collaborated on several professional educator books . Together they have four sons . His young adult novel Uncle Daddy won a Christopher Medal in the Books for Young People , ages 10 â `` 12 category in 2002 . Fig Pudding , a young adult chapter book by Fletcher , was recommended as one of the ten best books of 1995 by the American Library Association . Fletcher 's poetry book I Am Wings was chosen by School Library Journal as one of their best books of 1994 . In 1996 , Ralph Fletcher wrote the book `` Breathing In , Breathing Out ; Keeping A Writer 's Notebook '' . Although this book is geared towards an adult audience , it contributes a better understanding for educators of how to keep a writer 's notebook and instill the values within Writer 's Workshop for children . Fletcher writes that `` keeping a notebook may be the single best way to survive as a writer . '' This book provides examples of situations in which Fletcher personally used his writerâ s notebook for himself to cope , jot down story starters , write poems , let out rage or frustrations , or simply a place to unleash all that was on his mind . The purpose of this book is to allow people to see the value of having a writerâ s notebook and allowing it to be â a quiet place to catch your breath and begin writing . â Fletcher provides samples from his own writer 's notebook throughout the book to provide a better example of what a writer 's notebook truly is .
British Railways Class D3\/7 were diesel shunters built from May 1939 through to July 1942 by the London , Midland and Scottish Railway at their Derby Works . They were the first of a new design of diesel shunters based on the English Electric 6K diesel engine of 350 h. These were given LMS numbers 7080 â `` 7119 . Ten were loaned to the War Department in 1941 , and sold to the WD the following year . All ten survived the war ; six were then sold to Egyptian Railways and four to Italian State Railways ( Ferrovie dello Statoâ '' FS ) where they were matriculated as NE 700 . The other 30 stayed on the â home frontâ and later became British Railways numbers 12003 â `` 12032 . They were withdrawn during 1966\/67 , before TOPS classes were allocated . These locomotives were unusual in having a single , frame-mounted , traction motor and jackshaft drive . Most other English Electric diesel shunters ( e.g. British Rail Class D3\/6 ) had two axle-hung traction motors .
White Light\/White Heat is the second studio album by the American rock band The Velvet Underground . The record was the group 's last with violist and founding member John Cale . After the disappointing sales of The Velvet Underground 's first album , The Velvet Underground & Nico , the band 's relationship with Andy Warhol deteriorated . They toured throughout most of 1967 . Many of their live performances featured noisy improvisations that would become key elements on White Light\/White Heat . The band eventually fired Warhol and parted ways with Nico ; and ultimately went on to record their second album with Tom Wilson credited as producer . The album was recorded in just two days , and with a noticeably different style than The Velvet Underground & Nico . John Cale described White Light\/White Heat as `` a very rabid record ... The first one had some gentility , some beauty . The second one was consciously anti-beauty . '' Sterling Morrison said , `` We were all pulling in the same direction . We may have been dragging each other off a cliff , but we were all definitely going in the same direction . In the White Light\/White Heat era , our lives were chaos . Thatâ s whatâ s reflected in the record . '' The album briefly appeared on the Billboard 200 , although only peaking at number 199 . Despite its poor sales , the distorted , feedback-driven , and roughly recorded sound on White Light\/White Heat became a notable influence on punk and experimental rock . In 2003 , the album was ranked number 292 on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . Nearly every song on the album contains some sort of experimental or avant-garde quality . `` The Gift '' , for example , contains a recital of a short story and a loud instrumental rock song playing simultaneously , with the former on the left speaker channel and the latter on the right . `` I Heard Her Call My Name '' is distinguishable for its distorted guitar solos and prominent use of feedback . The record 's lyrics vary from themes of drug use and sexual references ( such as fellatio and orgies ) , including the song `` Lady Godiva 's Operation '' , about a transsexual 's botched lobotomy , and the title track `` White Light\/White Heat '' , which describes the use of amphetamine . On the album 's last track , `` Sister Ray '' , Reed tells a tale of debauchery , while the band plays an improvised 17 minute jam around three chords . The album cover to White Light\/White Heat is a faint image of a tattoo of a skull . The picture of the tattooed arm was photographed , enlarged and distorted by Billy Name , one of the members of The Factory . It is difficult to distinguish the tattoo , as the image is black , printed on a slightly lighter black background . On this cover , the album name , the Verve logo , and the band name are all on one line . An alternative cover was used for Polydor 's mid-1980s reissues . This cover had a completely black background , without the arm in the background . On this version , the album name , Verve logo , and band name are printed on three separate lines . There also exists a unique MGM Records UK cover , produced from 1976 until the early 1980s , featuring a white background and abstract toy soldiers . All tracks written by Lou Reed unless otherwise noted . ; Side one
The MTV Movie Awards is a film awards show presented annually on MTV ( formerly initialized as Music Television ) . It also contains movie parodies that used official movie footage with hosts and other celebrities and music performances . The nominees are decided by producers and executives at MTV . Winners are decided online by the general public . Presently voting is done through MTV 's official website through a special Movie Awards link at movieawards.mtv.com . Unlike its sister event MTV Video Music Awards ( which are broadcast live ) , the MTV Movie Awards ( up to 2006 ) were taped and then broadcast a few days later . The entire production was taped in a completely different order than what the MTV viewing audience saw . For example , the show 's host would tape all his\/her monologues and introductions at one time , and all the musical acts would perform one after the other . Celebrities would often only appear at the live taping for the announcement of their award category , and members of the general audience fill their vacant seats during the other times . Through clever editing , MTV was able to present to its viewing audience an awards show which appears to be taped in live sequence , with celebrities sticking around for the whole show . This method of production allowed foul language to be edited from the show and also is more convenient for celebrities . The actual live taping aired same-day on pay-per-view channels in most metropolitan cities around the world . Some awards telecasts had also been shown in television syndication . However , in 2007 , this changed , as MTV and Survivor producer Mark Burnett ( who took over duties from Joel Gallen for the 2007 awards ) announced the '07 edition would be broadcast live on MTV for the first time on June 3 , 2007 in Los Angeles . MTV has awarded at least three fictional characters their version of the Academy Honorary Award : Godzilla , Jason Voorhees , and Chewbacca . Jason was awarded the honor in 1992 . Godzilla was awarded it in 1996 , and Chewbacca the following year . ( Carrie Fisher presented him with a medal identical to that which Han Solo and Luke Skywalker were given by Princess Leia , who was portrayed by Fisher , at the ceremony at the end of Star Wars since it was a long running complaint that Chewbacca never received one in the movie ) . The category existed as a spoof award through 1997 , where other recipients included Jackie Chan and Richard Roundtree . In 1998 , Clint Howard was the last person given the award . The award was retired in 1998 , but reemerged seven years later as the MTV Generation Award ; Tom Cruise in 2005 , Jim Carrey in 2006 , Mike Myers in 2007 , Adam Sandler in 2008 , Ben Stiller in 2009 and Sandra Bullock in 2010 . Since 1993 , scenes are spoofed , mostly from that year 's most popular films , although television shows and older movies have also been chosen . This may include sound and video montages , replacing some of the original cast with other actors ( commonly , the hosts of each year 's show ) generally mocking the scenes of that film . The diversity of the spoofs can vary greatly , from one dialogue ( such as in 2005 ) to several long scenes , including fighting and action sequences ( 2003 ) .

In chemistry , the phosphonium ( IUPAC : phosphanium ) cation , an analog of the ammonium cation , is a positively charged polyatomic ion with the chemical formula PH4 + , resulting from protonation of phosphine . It has a molar mass of 35.01 g\/mol . Salts containing alkyl or aryl groups attached to a positive phosphorus are referred to as phosphonium salts . Alkyltriphenylphosphonium salts are widely used for the preparation of Wittig reagents for the Wittig reaction .
Street prostitution is a form of prostitution in which a sex worker solicits customers from a public place , most commonly a street , while waiting at street corners or walking alongside a street , but also other public places such as parks , beaches , etc. . The street prostitute is often dressed in a provocative manner . The sex act may be performed in the customer 's car or in a nearby secluded street location , or at the prostitute 's apartment or in a rented room . Street prostitution is often illegal even in jurisdictions which allow other forms of prostitution . Many countries which outlaw street prostitution have `` unofficial '' tolerance zones , where the practice is tolerated by the authorities , in spite of its illegality . In some jurisdictions where prostitution itself is not illegal , such as in Canada and the UK , street prostitution is still illegal . The prohibition applies to both prostitutes and customers , and these two countries also outlaw brothels . Some jurisdictions also outlaw curb crawling , slowly driving around with the intent to procure the services of a prostitute . In Australia , in New South Wales it is not illegal to solicit on the streets , except in some areas ( eg , near schools etc ) . The other Australian states and territories prohibit street solicitation , although some of these jurisdictions allow licensed brothels . Street prostitution is legal in New Zealand . In the United States , street prostitution is illegal in all 50 states ; 49 of the states outlaw all forms of prostitution ; Nevada allows licensed brothels , but only in some rural areas , not in the major metropolitan areas ( only 8 counties have active brothels and prostitution outside these brothels is illegal throughout the state ) . In six towns in the Netherlands a special zone ( tippelzone ) is designated for legal street prostitution . The zone is often in a business park , to avoid inconvenience for residents . In some of the zones the prostitutes need a license ; in some of these zones no new licenses are granted anymore , there is an `` extinction policy '' . Street prostitutes are extremely vulnerable to physical and sexual assaults , as well as to muggings , by clients and pimps . Melissa Farley 's study of 854 prostitutes in nine countries , including The United States of America , found that 95 % of women had been physically assaulted , and 75 % had been raped . 89 % of the women interviewed stating that they wanted to leave prostitution . In a 2008 study of Chicago , USA street prostitutes , economists Steven D. Levitt and Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh found that women working without pimps work for an average hourly rate of about $ 25 , and those working with pimps make 50 % more . This is roughly four times the wage of other jobs available to them . Condoms are rarely used . Prostitutes are arrested once for every 450 encounters , and every tenth arrest results in jail time . Once every 30 encounters , a prostitute gives free sex to an on-duty police officer to avoid arrest .
Breinigerberg is one of 17 districts and villages belonging to the city of Stolberg ( Rhineland ) , which is one of the major cities in the district of Aachen . According to a census dated December 31 , 2005 the village had 971 inhabitants . The country road L12 passing through Breinigerberg centrally connects the village in western direction to Breinig and in eastern direction to the crossing Nachtigaellchen which is west of Mausbach . In the east of Breinigerberg you can find the forest of Stolberg ( part of the natural preserve Naturpark Nordeifel ) and the natural reserve Schlangenberg which is famous for its calamine flora . The hill Schlangenberg is 276 m above sea level and originates in the former ore mine of Breinigerberg . Names like Bleiweg , which means `` Way of lead '' , even today , give hints to the history of the village . The calamine from the ore mine Breinigerberg was used exclusively in Stolberg for the production of brass . The history of Breinigerberg can be traced back to the Romans . 25 coins dated between 100 BC and the year 92\/93 AD as well as remains of a Roman craftsmen settlement had been found in the village . The buildings proved ancient roman work between the years 100 and 400 AD in this Breinigerberg region . In a building of the former junior high school which was closed in 1988 an information center on the Schlangenberg natural reserve was founded by the Eifel - und Heimatverein Breinig . It is open to the public and presents detailed information on the special flora and fauna of the Schlangenberg region . Historical tools used in the ore mines of Breinigerberg were exhibited as well . In the north and south of Breinigerberg there are further natural reserves like the natural reserve Brockenberg or Baerenstein . Most of them had been former chalk pits . Breinigerberg has two sports grounds used by the local football team FC . Breinigerberg . The former junior high school is also used as a youth center ( youth center Remember ) . One of the major events at Breinigerberg is the funfair one week after Christian Pentecost .
Indonesian Wikipedia is the edition of Wikipedia in the Indonesian language . The Indonesian Wikipedia has become the fifth fastest-growing Wikipedia in an Asian language after the Japanese , Chinese , Korean and Turkish language Wikipedias , and the third largest of any developing country ( 2006 ) . Its first article , `` Electron '' , was written on May 30 , 2003 , yet its Main Page ( Halaman utama ) was created six months later on November 29 . As of February 2009 , there were over 100,000 articles in the Indonesian Wikipedia project . Although the Indonesian language is similar to Malay language , Indonesian Wikipedia remains separated from the Malay Wikipedia ( initiated on October 2002 ) . Indonesian is a normative form of the Malay language , an Austronesian ( or Malayo-Polynesian ) language which had been used as a lingua franca in the Indonesian archipelago for centuries , and was elevated to the status of official language with the Indonesian declaration of independence in 1945 , drawing inspiration from the Sumpah Pemuda ( Youth 's Oath ) event in 1928 . It is very similar to the official Malaysian form of the language . However it does differ from the Malaysian form in some ways , with differences in pronunciation and also in vocabulary , due in large part to the many Dutch words in the Indonesian vocabulary . It is spoken as a mother tongue by only 7 % of the population of Indonesia , but altogether more than 200 million people speak it . Malay language , spoken by ethnic groups who reside in the Malay Peninsula , southern Thailand , parts of the Philippines , and Singapore ; also considered one of the dialects of the Indonesian language by the people of Indonesia living in central eastern Sumatra , the Riau Islands and parts of the coast of Borneo . Internally , in the English language Wikipedia there is an ongoing Indonesian project . It concentrates on English-language material about Indonesia . In 2004 , Tempo magazine published a feature about the Indonesian Wikipedia , where Revo Soekatno one of its most known contributors described it as the `` Encyclopedia from the boarding houses '' , meaning an encyclopedia that was produced by those Indonesians living and studying overseas . The article contributed to the popularization of Wikipedia in the archipelago and since then the Indonesian Wikipedia has seen its number of users rise remarkably . On 2006 , following TIME 's article person of the year `` You '' ( 2006 ) about Wikipedia , KOMPAS published a feature article on Revo where he was called the `` father of Wikipedia in Indonesian '' . The article highlighted the spirit of participation as the type of `` Addiction to the cyberspace that needed to be endorsed '' . Other Indonesian publications followed suit to refer to Revo Soekatno as an `` activist that built a community portal in Indonesia '' praising his contributions to the presence of Indonesia in the Internet . In February 2009 , the Indonesian Wikipedia achieved its milestone of reaching 100 thousand articles . One of the contributors mentioned in the article was the user borgx , who made 80 thousands edits since 2005 , the same year he registered as a user . The Indonesian Wikipedia at that time had only fifty active contributors . In March 2007 , the Bina Nusantara University invited the Indonesian wikipedians to speak at the first Wikipedia seminar for the public , and to explain at its campus in Jakarta , what the Wikipedia Bahasa Indonesia and the Wikimedia Foundation projects were about . In November 2007 , the Indonesian Government through its Department of Communication and Information decided to establish an annual Indonesian ICT Award and invited the Indonesian Wikipedia Community to hold a workshop on how to write articles in the Wikipedia . Ivan Lanin , one of the speakers interviewed by Antara stated that the number of contributors to the Indonesian Wikipedia was rising , and the articles beginning to become more diverse . According to Revo 's speech , the challenge for the Indonesian Wikipedia in the future was to gain credibility and give the public public assurance about the quality of the content provided in the Indonesian Wikipedia . The first day of the workshop was attended by 40 people , while the computers provided for the hands-on practice were limited , and considerably fewer than the participants . One of the participants wrote in his blog that he was very excited about participating in the Wikipedia workshop and learned a lot ; he was so excited that he forgot to have lunch and felt dizzy afterwards . The following year , in the 2008 Indonesian ICT Award , the Indonesian Wikipedia Community held separate workshop sessions for the public and for organizations . In August 2008 , the Indonesian version of CHIP Magazine distributed a complimentary DVD containing more than 80,000 articles ( without images ) with its 11th anniversary edition . This edition also featured a three-page Wikipedia article titled `` Wikipedia : When one thousand brains are better than one '' . The article provided an extensive history of Wikipedia , including the Indonesian Wikipedia as well as a description of the , at that time in preparation , Wikimedia Indonesia . However , before the release of Chip 's Indonesian Wikipedia DVD , versions of the Indonesian Wikipedia in DVD containing images existed already in the market since April 2008 and could be purchased online for 20 thousand rupiah , around US$ 2 , from an independent vendor . These are Wikipedias written in local Indonesian languages . Two are still in the Incubator .
Turbostar is the name given to a family of diesel multiple units ( DMUs ) built by Bombardier Transportation ( previously ADtranz ) at their Litchurch Lane Works in Derby , England . The Turbostar was the first new train type to be introduced after the privatisation of British Rail , and is the most common type of diesel multiple unit ( its electrical variant , the Electrostar , is in turn the most common electric multiple unit ) . The first units were ordered by Chiltern Railways in 1996 and were designated Class 168 ( also known as Clubman ) . Since then the family has grown with the addition of the Class 170 , Class 171 , and ( in development ) the Class 172 . The Clubman\/Turbostar\/Electrostar platform is a modular design , which share the same basic design , bodyshell and core structure , and is optimised for speedy manufacture and easy maintenance . It consists of an underframe , which is created by seam-welding a number of aluminium alloy extrusions , upon which bodyside panels are mounted followed by a single piece roof , again made from extruded sections . The car ends ( cabs ) are made from glass-reinforced plastic and steel , and are huck-bolted onto the main car bodies . Underframe components are collected in â raftsâ , which are bolted into slots on the underframe extrusion . The mostly aluminium alloy body gives light weight to help acceleration and energy efficiency . Much of the design is derived from the Networker Turbo Class 165 and Class 166 trains built by BREL . Notable features shared are the aluminium alloy frame and two speed Voith T211r hydrodynamic transmission system . The diesel engine has changed to an MTU 6R 183TD . A cardan shaft links the output of the gearbox to ZF final drives ( instead of Gmeinder in the Networkers ) on the inner bogie of each vehicle . The engine and transmission are situated under the body ; one bogie per car is powered , the other bogie unpowered . Turbostars have been acquired for use by several train operating companies , each with different specifications . One of the more noticeable differences with later units compared to earlier ones are the larger headlights now specified for safety reasons . Units are numbered 168 xxx , 170 xxx , 171 xxx , or 172 xxx , where xxx is the serial number of the unit . Individual carriages are numbered 50xxx and 79xxx for driving motor cars , and 56xxx and 54xxx for center cars . One factor which contributes to the popularity of the Turbostars is that Class 170 units are fully capable of working in multiple with older types from the Class 15x Sprinter and Class 16x Networker Turbo series of units as well as other units of the same class , unlike all other types built since privatisation , giving them much more flexibility . However , there are issues with so-called `` sandwich '' formations , formed either 170-15x-170 or 15x-170-15x , which causes problems with empty stock movements where up to 4 units of various types coupled together is common . A possible side effect of this is that Turbostars ' performance is in line with the second generation 15x units , in fact being somewhat slower than a Class 150 or Class 156 on `` short hop '' workings , and slower than a Class 158 on longer distance workings unless there is enough 100mph running to take advantage of the 10mph higher top speed of the Class 170 . The Class 171 units are fitted with Dellner couplers rather than BSI ( Bergische Stahl Industrie ) couplers , which means that they can operate in multiple with Southern 's Class 377 Electrostar EMUs .
North is a noun , adjective , or adverb indicating direction or geography . North is one of the four cardinal directions or compass points . It is the opposite of south and is perpendicular to east and west . By convention , the top side of a map is north . To go north using a compass for navigation , set a bearing or azimuth of 0 Â or 360 Â . The word north is related to the Old High German nord , both descending from the Proto-Indo-European unit ner - , meaning `` down '' ( or `` under '' ) . ( Presumably a natural primitive description of its concept is `` to the left of the rising sun '' . ) Latin borealis is from Greek boreas `` north wind , north '' , in mythology ( according to Ovid ) personified as the son of the river-god Strymon , and father of Calais and Zetes ; septentrionalis is from septentriones , `` the seven plow oxen '' , a name of Ursa Maior . Greek arktikos `` northern '' is named for the same constellation ( c.f. Arctic ) . Other languages have sometimes more interesting derivations . For example , in Lezgian kefer can mean both ` disbelief ' and ` north ' , since north of Muslim Lezgians there are areas inhabited by non-Muslim ( until recently ) Caucasian peoples , such as Avars and Chechens ; as well as pagan Turkic peoples . In many languages of Mesoamerica , ` north ' also means ` up ' . Magnetic north is of interest because it is the direction indicated as north on a properly functioning ( but uncorrected ) magnetic compass . The difference between it and true north is called the magnetic declination ( or simply the declination where the context is clear ) . For many purposes and physical circumstances , the error in direction that results from ignoring the distinction is tolerable ; in others a mental or instrument compensation , based on assumed knowledge of the applicable declination , can solve all the problems . But simple generalizations on the subject should be treated as unsound , and as likely to reflect popular misconceptions about terrestrial magnetism . Maps intended for usage in orienteering by compass will clearly indicate the local declination for easy correction to true north . The visible rotation of the night sky around the visible celestial pole provides a vivid metaphor of that direction corresponding to up . Thus the choice of the north as corresponding to up in the northern hemisphere , or of south in that role in the southern , is , prior to world-wide communication , anything but an arbitrary one . On the contrary , it is of interest that Chinese and Islamic culture even considered south as the proper top end for maps . While the choice of north over south as prime direction reflects quite arbitrary historical factors , east and west are not nearly as natural alternatives as first glance might suggest . Their folk definitions are , respectively , `` where the sun rises '' and `` where it sets '' . Except on the Equator , however , these definitions , taken together , would imply that Reasonably accurate folk astronomy , such as is usually attributed to Stone Age peoples or later Celts , would arrive at east and west by noting the directions of rising and setting ( preferably more than once each ) and choosing as prime direction one of the two mutually opposite directions that lie halfway between those two . The true folk-astronomical definitions of east and west are `` the directions , a right angle from the prime direction , that are closest to the rising and setting , respectively , of the sun ( or moon ) . Being the `` default '' direction on the compass , North is referred to frequently in Western popular culture . Some examples include :
FlÃ malle is a Walloon municipality located in the Belgian province of LiÃ ge . On January 1 , 2006 FlÃ malle had a total population of 25,140 . The total area is 36.68 kmÂ which gives a population density of 685 inhabitants per kmÂ .
Ununtrium is the temporary name of a synthetic element with the temporary symbol Uut and atomic number 113 . It is placed as the heaviest member of the group 13 ( IIIA ) elements although a sufficiently stable isotope is not known at this time that would allow chemical experiments to confirm its position . It was first detected in 2003 in the decay of ununpentium and was synthesized directly in 2004 . Only fourteen atoms of ununtrium have been observed to date . The longest-lived isotope known is 286Uut with a half-life of ~ 20 s , allowing first chemical experiments to study its chemistry . The first report of ununtrium was in August 2003 when it was identified as a decay product of ununpentium . These results were published on February 1 , 2004 , by a team composed of Russian scientists at Dubna ( Joint Institute for Nuclear Research ) , and American scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory . On July 23 , 2004 , a team of Japanese scientists at RIKEN detected a single atom of 278Uut using the cold fusion reaction between bismuth-209 and zinc-70 . They published their results on September 28 , 2004 . Support for their claim appeared in 2004 when scientists at the Institute of Modern Physics ( IMP ) identified 266Bh as decaying with identical properties to their single event ( see bohrium ) . The RIKEN team produced a further atom on April 2 , 2005 , although the decay data were different from the first chain , and may be due to the formation of a meta-stable isomer . The Dubna-Livermore collaboration has strengthened their claim for the discovery of ununtrium by conducting chemical experiments on the decay daughter 268Db . In experiments in Jun 2004 and Dec 2005 , the Dubnium isotope was successfully identified by milking the Db fraction and measuring any SF activities . Both the half-life and decay mode were confirmed for the proposed 268Db which lends support to the assignment of Z = 115 and Z = 113 to the parent and daughter nuclei . Theoretical estimates of alpha-decay half-lives of alpha-decay chains from element 113 are in good agreement with the experimental data . The element with atomic number 113 is historically known as eka-thallium . Ununtrium ( Uut ) is a temporary IUPAC systematic element name . Research scientists usually refer to the element simply as element 113 ( or E113 ) . Claims to the discovery of ununtrium have been put forward by Dmitriev of the Dubna team and Morita of the RIKEN team . The IUPAC\/IUPAP Joint Working Party will decide to whom the right to suggest a name will be given . The IUPAC have the final say on the official adoption of a name . = = = = Target-Projectile combinations leading to Z = 113 compound nucleiCold fusion209Bi ( 70Zn , xn ) 279-xUut ( x = 1 ) Hot fusion237Np ( 48Ca , xn ) 285-xUut ( x = 3 ) As a decay productYields of isotopesCold fusionHot fusionTheoretical calculationsEvaporation residue cross sectionsChemical propertiesExtrapolated chemical propertiesOxidation statesChemistry = = = = Ununtrium should portray eka-thallium chemical properties and should therefore form a monoxide , Uut2O , and monohalides , UutF , UutCl , UutBr , and UutI . If the + III state is accessible , it is likely that it is only possible in the oxide , Uut2O3 , and fluoride , UutF3 . Spin-orbit splitting of the 7p orbitals may stabilize the -1 state as well , as is seen with gold ( -1 ) ( aurides ) .

A taco is a traditional Mexican dish composed of a corn or wheat tortilla folded or rolled around a filling . A taco can be made with a variety of fillings , including beef , chicken , seafood , vegetables and cheese , allowing for great versatility and variety . A taco is generally eaten without utensils and is often accompanied by garnishes such as salsa , avocado or guacamole , cilantro , tomatoes , onions and lettuce . According to the Real Academia EspaÃ ola , publisher of Diccionario de la Lengua EspaÃ ola , the word taco describes a typical Mexican dish of a maize tortilla folded around food ( `` Tortilla de maÃ z enrollada con algÃ n alimento dentro , tÃ pica de MÃ xico '' ) . The original sense of the word is of a `` plug '' or `` wad '' used to fill a hole ( `` Pedazo de madera , metal u otra materia , corto y grueso , que se encaja en algÃ n hueco '' ) . The Online Etymological Dictionary defines taco as a `` tortilla filled with spiced meat '' and describes its etymology as derived from Mexican Spanish , `` light lunch , '' literally , `` plug , wadding . '' The taco predates the arrival of Europeans in Mexico . There is anthropological evidence that the indigenous people living in the lake region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate tacos filled with small fish . Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors , Bernal DÃ az del Castillo documented the first taco feast enjoyed by Europeans , a meal which HernÃ n CortÃ s arranged for his captains in CoyoacÃ n. It is not clear why the Spanish used their word , `` taco '' , to describe this indigenous food . As an accompaniment to tacos , many taco stands will serve whole or sliced red radishes , lime slices , salt , pickled or grilled chilis ( hot peppers ) , and occasionally cucumber slices , or grilled cambray onions . Beginning from the early part of the twentieth century , various styles of tacos have become popular in the United States and Canada . The style that has become most common is the hard-shell , U-shaped version first described in a cookbook authored by Fabiola Cabeza de Vaca Gilbert and published in Santa Fe , New Mexico in 1949 . These have been sold by restaurants and by fast food chains . Even non-Mexican oriented fast food restaurants have sold tacos . Mass production of this type of taco was encouraged by the invention of devices to hold the tortillas in the U-shape as they were deep-fried . A patent for such a device was issued to New York restaurateur Juvenico Maldonado in 1950 , based on his patent filing of 1947 ( U.S. Patent No. 2,506,305 ) . Such tacos are crisp-fried corn tortillas filled with seasoned ground beef , cheese , lettuce , and sometimes tomato , onion , salsa , sour cream , and avocado or guacamole . In this context , soft tacos are tacos made with wheat flour tortillas and filled with the same ingredients as a hard taco . Since at least 1978 , a variation called the `` puffy taco '' has been popular . Originating in San Antonio , Texas , uncooked corn tortillas ( flattened balls of masa dough ) are quickly fried in hot oil until they expand and become `` puffy '' . Fillings are similar to hard-shell versions . Restaurants offering this style of taco have since appeared in other Texas cities , as well as in California . Kits are available at grocery and convenience stores and usually consist of taco shells ( corn tortillas already fried in a U-shape ) , seasoning mix and taco sauce . Commercial vendors for the home market also market soft taco kits with tortillas instead of taco shells . The breakfast taco , found in Tex-Mex cuisine , is filled with meat , eggs , or cheese , with other ingredients . The tacodilla contains melted cheese in between the two folded tortillas , thus resembling a quesadilla . Indian tacos , sometimes known as Navajo tacos but served in various parts of the American West and Midwest , are made using frybread instead of tortillas . They are commonly served at pow-wows , festivals , and other gatherings . <!-- Commented out link which cannot be found on Internet Archive nor on its original website--!>

Kasur District or Qasur District is one of the districts in the province of Punjab , Pakistan It came into existence on 1 July 1976 . Earlier it was part of Lahore District . The district capital is Kasur city , the birth city of the Sufi poet Bulleh Shah , well known in that region as well as in the whole of Pakistan . The total area of the district is 3,995 square kilometres . According to the 1998 census , the total population of the district is 2,376,000 . Of this 95.4 % are Muslims , 4.4 % are Christians while the rest are Ahmadis , Hindus and scheduled castes . 22.78 % of them lived in the urban areas . The district is bounded by the Ravi River in the north-west and river Sutlej in the south-east . Whereas the old course of Beas River bifurcates the district into two equal parts locally known as Hither and Uthar or Mithan Majh . Both of the areas have a height differential of approximately 5.5 meters . The natural surface elevation of the district is 198 meters above the sea level , having a general slope from north-east to south - west . Whereas the east and west ends of the district comprise the flood plains of the rivers Satluj and Ravi , characterized by breaching of looping river Channels braided around meander bars . Topographically speaking , Kasur District lies between the river Satluj which flows along its boundaries with India and river Ravi which flows its boundary with Sheikhupura District . The districts may be divided into two parts , a low lying or riverine area along the two bordering rivers and upland , away from the rivers . The riverine area is generally inundates during monsoon season . The water level in this area is higher than in the upland . The soil is sandy . The upland is flat plains sloping from north-west to south-west . The general height of the area is from 150 to 200 meters above the sea level . Flora of the district has been greatly modified by human agency of the old open forests of small trees and shrubs ; there remains only a few Rakhs or portions of forest which are kept as gazing ground for cattle etc. .

Waremme is a Walloon municipality located in the province of LiÃ ge , in Belgium . The city is located on the River Geer , in the loessic Hesbaye region . The economy is based on the cultivation of cereals and sugar beet , and on the food industry . The municipality of Waremme includes the following villages : Bettincourt , Bleret , Bovenistier , Grand-Axhe , Lantermange , and Oleye . Several findings were unearthed near Waremme containing remnants of Neolithic and Bronze Age settlements . The main Roman road linking Bavai to Cologne passed right through the territory . Tumuli and Roman villas were found nearby . The medieval hamlet of Woromia was cited for the first time in 965 . On February 5 , 1078 , Woromia was ceded to the Prince-Bishopric of LiÃ ge , together with its castle , five mills , and six breweries . By 1215 , with its 815 inhabitants , it had grown to town size . Its frontier position near the Duchy of Brabant , however , attracted several raids from the duke , causing it to be burnt to the ground and rebuilt at least a couple of times . In the 14th century , the town built a market place and a hospital , slowly becoming an important regional center , where coins were issued and important meetings held . During his conquest of the Prince-Bishopric of LiÃ ge , Charles the Bold burnt the city once more in 1468 . In the 16th century , the town became one of the 21 bonnes villes ( main cities ) of the prince-bishopric . In 1748 , a quarter of the city was again destroyed by fire , this time accidentally . In 1792 , the French Revolutionary troops entered the city and closed the convents . Three years later , the Prince-Bishopric of LiÃ ge was dissolved and the city became French . The 19th century was prosperous , thanks to the advent of the railways linking Mechelen to Ans , and the construction of two sugar refineries and several schools . World War I did not bring any destruction to the city , except for that of the old surrounding walls . World War II , however , was a lot worse as half of the city was destroyed by air raids , only days before Liberation Day . The city then counted about 5,000 inhabitants .

Seneffe is a Walloon municipality located in the Belgian province of Hainaut . On January 1 , 2006 Seneffe had a total population of 10,743 . The total area is 62.77 kmÂ which gives a population density of 171 inhabitants per kmÂ . The Castle of Seneffe , now a museum belonging to the French Community of Belgium , is located in the municipality . Between 1965 and 1982 Seneffe was the location of a car plant belonging to British Leyland , which in its later years assembled models including the Mini and the Austin Allegro from crated kits shipped from the company 's Cowley facility . A significant milestone was reached in June 1977 when the plant produced its 500,000 th vehicle , an Austin Allegro 1300 Special . The Seneffe plant was closed in 1982 as the company 's aging model range lost market share across Europe , with further loss of demand resulting from the depressed state of the UK economy at the time . With alternative employment opportunities limited , the plant closure triggered considerable bitterness locally .
Fur seals are any of nine species of pinnipeds in the Otariidae family . One species , the northern fur seal ( Callorhinus ursinus ) inhabits the North Pacific , while seven species in the Arctocephalus genus are found primarily in the Southern hemisphere . They are much more closely related to sea lions than true seals , and share with them external ears ( pinnae ) , relatively long and muscular foreflippers , and the ability to walk on all fours . They are marked by their dense underfur , which made them a long-time object of commercial hunting . Until recently , fur seals were all grouped under a single subfamily of Pinnipedia called Arctocephalinae to contrast them with Otariinae â `` the sea lions â `` based on the most prominent common feature , namely the coat of dense underfur intermixed with guard hairs . Recent genetic evidence , however , suggests that Callorhinus is more closely related to some sea lion species , and the fur seal\/sealion subfamily distinction has been eliminated from many taxonomies . Nonetheless , all fur seals have certain features in common : the fur , generally smaller sizes , farther and longer foraging trips , smaller and more abundant prey items and greater sexual dimorphism . For these reasons , the distinction remains useful . Fur seals share with other otariids the ability to turn their rear limbs forward and move on all fours . Fur seals are generally smaller than sea lions . At under 1 m , the Galapagos fur seal is the smallest of all pinnipeds . However , their flippers tend to be proportionately longer , their pelage tends to be darker and the vibrissae more prominent . Males are often more than five times heavier than the females , making them among the most sexually dimorphic of all mammal groups . Typically , fur seals gather during the summer months annually in large assemblages at specific beaches or rocky outcrops to give birth and breed . All species are polygynous , meaning dominant males reproduce with more than one female . For most species , total gestation lasts about 11.5 months , including a several month period of delayed implantation of the embryo . While northern fur seal males aggressively select and defend the specific females in their harems , males of southern species of fur seal tend to protect spatial territories and females are free to choose or switch their mates according to their own preference or social hierarchy . After several continuous days of nursing the newborn pups , females go on extended foraging trips that can last as long as a week , returning to the rookery to feed their pups until they are weaned . Males fast during the reproductive season , unwilling to leave their females or territories . The remainder of the year , fur seals lead a largely pelagic existence in the open sea pursuing their prey wherever it is abundant and plentiful . Fur seals feed on moderately sized fish , squid and krill . Several species of the southern fur seal also have sea birds , especially penguins , as part of their diet . The fur seals themselves are preyed upon by sharks , orcas and occasionally by larger sea lions . When fur seals were hunted in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries , they hauled out on remote islands where there were no predators . The hunters reported being able to club the unwary animals to death one after another , making the hunt profitable even though the price per seal skin was low . Many fur seal species were heavily exploited by commercial sealers , especially during the 19th century when their fur was highly valued . Beginning in the 1790s , the ports of Stonington and New Haven , Connecticut were leaders of the American fur seal trade , which primarily entailed clubbing fur seals to death on uninhabited South Pacific islands , skinning them , and selling the hides in China . Many populations , notably the Guadalupe fur seal , northern fur seal and Cape fur seal , suffered dramatic declines and are still recovering . Currently , most species are protected and hunting is mostly limited to subsistence harvest . Globally , most populations can be considered healthy , mostly because they often prefer remote habitats that are relatively inaccessible to humans . Nonetheless , environmental degradation , competition with fisheries and climate change potentially pose threats to some populations .
S\/2006 S 1 is a natural satellite of Saturn . Its discovery was announced by Scott S. Sheppard , David C. Jewitt , Jan Kleyna , and Brian G. Marsden on June 26 , 2006 from observations taken between January 4 and April 30 , 2006 . S\/2006 S 1 is about 6 kilometres in diameter , and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 18,930.2 Mm in 972.407 days , at an inclination of 154.2 Â to the ecliptic ( 175.4 Â to Saturn 's equator ) , in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.1303 .
Cape can be used to describe any sleeveless outer garment , such as a poncho , but usually it is a long garment that covers only the back half of the wearer , fastening around the neck . They were common in medieval Europe , especially when combined with a hood in the chaperon , and have had periodic returns to fashion , for example , in nineteenth century Europe . Roman Catholic clergy wear a type of cape known as a ferraiolo , which is worn for formal events outside of a liturgical context . The cope is a liturgical vestment in the form of a cape . Capes are often highly decorated with elaborate embroidery . Capes remain in regular use as rain wear in various military units and police forces , for example in France . A gas cape was a voluminous military garment designed to give rain protection to someone wearing the bulky gas masks used in twentieth century wars . In modern times , comic-book super-heroes , such as Superman and Batman , are often depicted wearing capes . In fashion , the word cape usually refers to a shorter garment and cloak to a full-length version of the different types of garment , though the two terms are sometimes used synonymously for full-length coverings . The fashion cape does not cover the front to any appreciable degree . In raingear , a cape is usually a long and roomy protective garment worn to keep one dry in the rain . In full evening dress , ladies frequently use the cape as a fashion statement , or to protect the wearer or the fine fabrics of their evening-wear from the elements , especially where a coat would crush -- or hide -- the garment . These capes may be short ( over the shoulders or to the waist ) or a full-length cloak . Short capes were usually made of , or trimmed in , fur ; however , because fur is less accepted as a fashion accessory in modern times , other expensive materials are substituted for it , with an opulent lining and trim . Typical fabrics used are velvet , silk and satin . Capes are still authorized as an alternative to the more utilitarian trench coat for U.S. Army officers in mess dress , formal evening uniform . Caped overcoats were popular for men during the Victorian era , with some caped Ulsters featuring multiple layered capes , and the Inverness coat ( both formal evening and working day variants ) had a cape . The Inverness coat is no longer commonly worn , and the Ulster lost its cape in the 1920s .

Sally Ann Struthers ( born July 28 , 1948 ) is an American actress and spokeswoman , best-known for her roles as Gloria Bunker Stivic on All in the Family , for which she won two Emmy awards , and as Babette on Gilmore Girls . Struthers was born in Portland , Oregon , and attended Grant High School . She is the daughter of Margaret Caroline ( nÃ e Jernes ) and Robert Alden Struthers , who was a surgeon . Her maternal grandparents were Norwegian immigrants . Struthers married Dr. William C. Rader , a psychiatrist , on December 18 , 1977 . Now divorced ( as of January 19 , 1983 ) , they had one child together , Samantha Struthers Rader . In Five Easy Pieces ( 1970 ) she was in a nude sex scene with Jack Nicholson , but achieved real fame as Gloria Bunker Stivic on the 1970s sitcom , All in the Family . Producer Norman Lear found the actress dancing on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour , a counterculture variety show whose writing staff included Rob Reiner . According to a WPTT-AM radio interview with Doug Hoerth in 2003 , Struthers thought that Reiner 's then-fianc Ã e and later wife , Penny Marshall , would get the role of Gloria , as Marshall resembled Jean Stapleton , who played Edith Bunker . Actress Candice Azzara had played the role of Gloria in a pilot episode , but was soon dropped . After a shaky start , word-of-mouth propelled the program to the top of the Nielsen ratings , giving tens of millions of viewers the chance to see `` Gloria '' defending her liberal viewpoints about negative stereotypes and inequality . Struthers won two Emmy Awards ( in 1972 and 1979 ) for her work in All in the Family . On the short-lived Archie Bunker 's Place spin-off Gloria ( 1982 â `` 1983 ) , Struthers reprised Gloria as a new divorcee ( she became an `` exchange student '' , when husband Mike exchanged her for one of his students ) . The series co-starred Burgess Meredith as the doctor of an animal clinic with Gloria as his assistant . In 2001 Struthers attended the funeral of Carroll O'Connor , along with other actors from the show . Struthers was a semi-regular panelist on the 1990 revival of Match Game . She also was an occasional celebrity guest on Win , Lose or Draw , even once guest hosting the NBC daytime version . She also had a recurring role as Bill Miller 's manipulative mother , Louise , on the CBS sitcom Still Standing and regularly appeared on Gilmore Girls as Babette Dell . Struthers has also provided voices for a number of animated series such as The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show ( as a teenage Pebbles Flintstone ) , TaleSpin ( as Rebecca Cunningham ) and Dinosaurs ( as Charlene Sinclair ) . Struthers is also widely known for her work with two organizations that advertised heavily on cable and late-night television . The first of these is the ChildFund International , advocating on behalf of impoverished children in developing countries , mainly in Africa . She has also worked with International Correspondence Schools . Now called Penn Foster Career School in America , the distance education organization offers degrees by sending lessons directly to individuals ' homes . Struthers ' activism has been satirized in the season 1 episode of South Park , `` Starvin ' Marvin , '' and the season 3 episode `` Starvin ' Marvin in Space . ''
Tim Wiese ( ; born 17 December 1981 in Bergisch Gladbach ) is a German goalkeeper who currently plays for Werder Bremen and the German national team . He joined Werder Bremen in 2005 from Kaiserslautern in the Bundesliga . He started his playing career at Bayer Leverkusen 's youth system , before moving to Fortuna KÃ ln , where he made his first-team debut in the German third division in 2000 . He moved to Bundesliga side Kaiserslautern in the winter break of the 2001 â `` 02 season and initially played for their reserve squad in the third division and served as backup for Georg Koch and Roman Weidenfeller in the first team . Following Weidenfeller 's transfer to Borussia Dortmund , he fought with Koch for the place of the first goalkeeper and made his Bundesliga debut at the beginning of the 2002 â `` 03 season , being replaced by Koch after conceding four goals in two matches . After the winter break , however , he managed to secure himself the position of the first-choice goalkeeper and established himself as one of the most talented new keepers in the Bundesliga . He was considered first-choice throughout the 2003 â `` 04 season , despite being sent off during the 2nd match of the season ( the first of two red cards he has received during his league career ) . He remained the first goalkeeper for Kaiserslautern until late November 2004 , when he lost his place to veteran Thomas Ernst . Wiese moved to Bremen in 2005 and was favored to replace the aging Andreas Reinke , but tore his cruciate ligaments twice and missed the entire first part of the season . In a twist of fate , due to a bad injury to Reinke in away match at VfB Stuttgart in February 2006 , Wiese made his Bundesliga debut for Werder Bremen and remained their first goalkeeper for the rest of the 2005 â `` 06 season . However , Wiese ( who is often compared to former German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn for his emotional outbursts ) had a shaky start , his low point was a stunning gaffe against Juventus in the 2nd round of the Champions League on 7 March 2006 . With only two minutes of the game left to play , and Werder Bremen on course to reach the quarter-finals , he made a routine catch but then somehow let go of the ball as he rolled on the ground , allowing Emerson to score and Juventus to progress . However , he has stabilized since then , and was vital for Bremen 's late surge that moved them past rivals Hamburg to claim second place during the 2005 â `` 06 season . Despite this resurgence , he has still struggled to shake off the shackles of his humiliation against Juventus , his most high profile contribution to world football . In the 2006 â `` 07 season , he eventually established himself as the first goalkeeper at Werder Bremen and only missed three Bundesliga matches throughout the season . In the 2008 â `` 09 DFB-Pokal semi-final against Hamburg , Wiese helped Werder Bremen progress to the final when he saved 3 consecutive penalties . He earned his first international cap for Germany against England on 19 November 2008 , when he came in as a substitute for RenÃ Adler at the beginning of the second half . He was a squad member for Germany in the 2010 FIFA World Cup , but was the only player not seeing any action as an understudy to Schalke 04 goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and was denied an appearance in the third-place playoff due to injury , enabling Bayern Munich veteran Hans-J Ã rg Butt to step in .
Rah Ahan Football Club is an Iranian football club based in Shahr-e-Rey . They currently play in the IPL . Rah Ahan was formed in 1937 in Tehran by Iran Railways and to this day the club still remains in their control . Rah Ahan has a history of supplying players to Esteghlal F.C. , however in recent times the number of players being transferred to Esteghlal has dramatically decreased . In 2008 Rah Ahan was moved to Shahr-e-Rey because the city of Tehran has many football teams that have low attendance figures . The club was promoted to the IPL with much controversy , after numerous allegations of match-fixing , and use of ineligible players . Sanat Naft F.C. launched complaints against the club , and Rah Ahan 's presence in the IPL was not certain until the very first day of the 2005 â `` 06 season . The courts in Iran at the beginning of the 2006 â `` 07 season confirmed that Rah Ahan had been promoted unfairly and that Sanat Naft should have been promoted instead .

Vicente M. Piccio ( born March 1 , 1927 in Iloilo , Iloilo ) is a retired major general of the Philippine Air Force . Piccio entered the Philippine Air Force Flying School in 1949 and graduated in 1951 . Commissioned as Second Lieutenant in the reserve force , he was assigned as Flight Commander and Instructor at Fernando Air Base in Lipa . A year later , he transferred to Basa Air Base in Floridablanca where he transitioned in the P-51 Mustang . In 1954 , he completed the Squadron Officers Course at the Air Force Officer School . He was promoted to First Lieutenant on December 2 , 1954 and integrated into the regular force on December 29 , 1955 . He was promoted to Captain on April 7 , 1956 . He was appointed Division Commander of the 3rd Air Division in 1978 and promoted to Brigadier General on July 11 , 1979 . On July 16 , 1980 , he was designated as the Commanding Officer of the Aviation Security Command and in 1981 became the Vice-Commander of the Philippine Air Force in concurrent capacity . In the same year , he was appointed President of Military Commission Number 5 . After a year , on April 5 , 1982 , he became Commanding General of the Philippine Air Force . On May 2 of the same year he was promoted to Major General . Piccio was responsible for issuing in 1985 a directive banning taxpayer-subsidized Philippine Air Force personnel from traveling or gaining employment abroad â without presidential clearance or authority . â Piccio is noted as the commander of the air force during the 1986 People Power Revolution , during which he lost effective control of the air force with the defection of a number of helicopter pilots from the 15th Strike Wing , under Col. Antonio Sotelo , that provided air cover for the rebel troops under then Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and Lt. Gen. Fidel V. Ramos , then head of the now defunct paramilitary group known as the Philippine Constabulary . The loss of the elite air force pilots , analysts and historians say , was key to the eventual success of the four-day civilian-backed nonviolent revolution that toppled the Marcos dictatorship . Piccio is married to Nena HernÃ ndez , an Antiqueña , and together they have seven children : Vincent Bernard , Elizabeth Mary , Philip Gregory , Bernard , Robert Ephrem , Cristopher , and Paul Anthony .
A subshrub ( Latin suffrutex ) or dwarf shrub is a short woody plant . Prostrate shrub is a similar term . It is distinguished from a shrub by its ground-hugging stems and lower height , with overwintering perennial woody growth typically less than 10 -- 20 cm tall , or by being only weakly woody and\/or persisting only for a few years . Small , low shrubs such as lavender , periwinkle , and thyme , and many members of the family Ericaceae , such as cranberries , are often classed as subshrubs . A chamaephyte or dwarf-shrub is a plant that bears hibernating buds on persistent shoots near the ground â `` usually woody plants with perennating buds borne close to the ground , no more than 25 c above soil surface . One significance of the closeness to the ground is that the buds remain within the surface boundary layer and are thus somewhat protected from harsh winter winds . Chamaephytes are especially important in stressful environments , for example in alpine , arctic or dry ecosystems , often grazed by herbivores , and on nutrient-poor soils or rock . Prominent examples are many of the species of maquis and other submediterranean dry ecosystems ( such as thyme , Thymus vulgaris , and rosemary , Rosmarinus officinalis ) , the different heather species ( e.g. Calluna vulgaris and Erica species ) , African wild olive ( Olea europaea ssp . cuspidata ) and edelweiss ( Leontopodium alpinum ) . The term chamaephyte is particularly used within the context of RaunkiÃ r plant life-forms . Chamaephytes also include cushion plants .
Westerbork concentration camp was a World War II Nazi refugee , detention and transit camp in Hooghalen , ten kilometres north of Westerbork , in the northeastern Netherlands . Its function during the Second World War was to assemble Roma and Dutch Jews for transport to other Nazi concentration camps . On 15 December 1938 , the Dutch government closed its border to refugees . From then on , any refugees would not have any rights . In 1939 , the Dutch government erected a refugee camp , Centraal Vluchtelingenkamp Westerbork , financed , ironically , partly by Dutch Jewry , in order to absorb fleeing Jews from Nazi Germany . The Jewish refugees were housed after they had tried in vain to escape Nazi terror in their homeland . During World War II , the Nazis took over the camp and turned it into a deportation camp . From this camp , 101,000 Dutch Jews and about 5,000 German Jews were deported to their deaths in Occupied Poland . In addition , there were about 400 Gypsies in the camp and , at the very end of the War , some 400 women from the resistance movement . In 1950 , the Dutch government appointed the Jewish historian Jacques Presser to investigate the events connected with the massive deportation of Dutch Jewry and the extent of the collaboration by the Dutch non-Jewish population . The results were published fifteen years later in The Catastrophe ( `` De Ondergang '' ) , a book which shocked the reading public and had a profound and lasting effect on the Dutch perception of the war years . Presser also published a novel ( The Night of the Girondins ) set in Westerbork camp itself . The hero is a Jewish prisoner , who is appointed an officer and has the problematic role of helping the Nazis transporting his `` brothers '' to their obvious deaths in Occupied Poland . Between July 1942 and September 1944 , almost every Tuesday a cargo train left for the concentration camps Auschwitz-Birkenau ( 65 train-loads containing 60,330 people most of whom were gassed on arrival ) , SobibÃ r ( 19 train-loads of 34,313 people , all of whom were killed on arrival ) , Bergen-Belsen and Theresienstadt ( 9 train-loads of 4,894 people some 2,000 of whom survived the war ) . In the period from 1942 to 1945 , a total of 107,000 people passed through the camp on a total of 93 outgoing trains . Only 5,200 of them survived , most of them in Theresienstadt or Bergen-Belsen , or were liberated at Westerbork . Anne Frank stayed in the hut shown to the left from August until early September 1944 , when she was taken to Auschwitz . She and her family were put on the first of the three final trains ( the three final transports were most probably a reaction to the Allies ' offensive ) on 2 September 1944 for Auschwitz , arriving there three days later . Etty Hillesum stayed in this camp from 30 July 1942 until 7 September 1943 , when she and her family were put on a train to Auschwitz . The German film actress and cabaret singer Dora Gerson was interned at Westerbork with her family before being transferred to Auschwitz . The Canadian 2nd Infantry Division liberated the several hundred inhabitants that were still at Westerbork on 12 April 1945 . The first soldiers to reach the camp were from the 8th Reconnaissance Regiment , followed by troops of the South Saskatchewan Regiment . Following its use in World War II , the Westerbork camp was first used as a penalty camp for alleged and accused Nazi collaborators and later housed Dutch nationals who fled the former Dutch East Indies ( Indonesia ) . Between 1950 and 1970 the camp was renamed to Kamp Schattenberg and used to house refugees from the Maluku Islands . In the 1970s the camp was demolished . Near the site there is now a museum , and monuments of remembrance of those transported and killed during World War II . The camp is freely accessible . The Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope ( WSRT ) was partially constructed on the site of the camp in 1969 . The last transport from Westerbork to Auschwitz with the Frank-family on it .
The term warm-blooded is a colloquial term to describe animal species which have a relatively higher blood temperature , and maintain thermal homeostasis primarily through internal metabolic processes . These are characteristics of mammals and birds . Both the terms `` warm-blooded '' and `` cold-blooded '' have fallen out of favor with scientists because of the vagueness of the terms and an increased understanding of the field . Body temperature types are not discrete categories . Each term may be replaced with one or more variants , see the next section for examples . Body temperature maintenance ( thermoregulation ) incorporates a wide range of different techniques that result in a body temperature continuum . Warm-bloodedness generally refers to three separate aspects of thermoregulation . A large proportion of the creatures traditionally called `` warm-blooded '' , such as mammals and birds , fit all three of these categories . However , over the past 30 years , studies in the field of animal thermophysiology have revealed many species belonging to these two groups that do not fit all these criteria . For example , many bats and small birds are poikilothermic and bradymetabolic when they sleep for the night , or day , as the case may be . For these creatures , the term heterothermy was coined . Further studies on animals that were traditionally assumed to be cold-blooded have shown that most creatures incorporate different variations of the three terms defined above , along with their counterparts ( ectothermy , poikilothermy and bradymetabolism ) , thus creating a broad spectrum of body temperature types . Even some fish have warm-blooded characteristics . Swordfish and some sharks have circulatory mechanisms that keep their brains and eyes above ambient temperatures , and thus increase their ability to detect and react to prey . Tunas and some sharks have similar mechanisms in their muscles , improving their stamina when swimming at high speed .
JosÃ NÃ stor PÃ kerman ( born September 3 , 1949 in Villa DomÃ nguez , Entre RÃ os ) is an Argentine football coach and an ex-football player . He become famous as a youth level coach for Argentina , winning the FIFA World Youth Championship three times , and the U-20 South American Youth Championship twice . He coached the Argentina national football team in the 2006 World Cup . PÃ kerman 's career as a footballer was uneventful . A midfielder , he played from 1970 to 1974 for Argentinos Juniors scoring 12 goals in 134 matches . He was transferred to Independiente MedellÃ n , in Colombia , where he scored 15 goals in 101 matches . His career as a player ended at age 28 with a serious knee injury . PÃ kerman was then forced to support himself and his family with various odd jobs , including a stint as a taxi driver . Back in Argentina , he worked as a youth coach for Chacarita Juniors and then occupied the same position with Argentinos Juniors . He then moved to Chile to coach Colo-Colo 's youth divisions . In 1994 , he was offered to coach the Argentinian national under-20 and under-17 sides by the Argentine Football Association . This caused some surprise as his rÃ sumÃ did not include any major achievements at this stage . He teamed up with Hugo Tocalli and coach Eduardo Urtasun . PÃ kerman 's success , however , silenced the critics : his under-20 team won the FIFA World Youth Championship three times , 1995 ( Qatar ) , 1997 ( Malaysia ) , and 2001 ( Argentina ) , thus giving the names to his three pet dogs - Qatar , Malaysia and Argentina . The team also won the two South American Youth Championships in 1997 and 1999 . When the national coach Daniel Passarella resigned after the 1998 FIFA World Cup , PÃ kerman was offered his position . He declined , assuming instead the position of General Manager of all national teams . Marcelo Bielsa was hired as coach on PÃ kerman 's recommendation , and remained in charge until after Argentina 's gold medal performance in the 2004 Summer Olympics . In 2003 PÃ kerman moved to Spain at the behest of Argentine businessman Daniel Grinbank , who had acquired Spanish Second Division side Club Deportivo LeganÃ s. After a few months as Director of Football , the project crumbled , and PÃ kerman left Spain . When Bielsa resigned as coach , PÃ kerman was one of the two candidates for the coaching job , alongside Carlos Bianchi , who had left Boca Juniors a few months earlier , and wanted to take a sabbatical year away from football . On September 15 , 2004 , PÃ kerman was named coach of the Argentina national football team , which qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup . They dominated its initial Group Stage matches and drew with the Netherlands , emerging on top of their group on goals difference . The albicelestes moved on to the knockout round , beating Mexico 2-1 in a comeback victory . In the quarterfinals , Argentina went ahead 1-0 against the host nation Germany , but shortly before the end of the match Germany equalized through a Miroslav Klose header . Germany would go on to win on penalties , sending Argentina out of the tournament . PÃ kerman made defensive substitutions including taking off Juan Roman Riquelme for Esteban Cambiasso . After the loss , PÃ kerman announced his resignation as Argentine national football coach . AFA boss Julio Grondona tried to dissuade PÃ kerman from leaving . It was later announced that Alfio Basile , who coached Argentina during the 1994 FIFA World Cup , would replace him as coach . On 30 May 2007 , PÃ kerman resumed his coaching career , taking up the position of head coach of Club Toluca in Mexico replacing fellow Argentine AmÃ rico Gallego . At the end of the Clausura 2008 tournament he was replaced by Jose Manuel de la Torre . On 23 February 2009 , he was appointed as the head coach of UANL Tigres after the sacking of Manuel Lapuente following a series of bad results . After the end of Clausura 2009 , PÃ kerman was dismissed as Coach of UANL Tigres and was replaced by Daniel Guzman . In the July of 2010 , it had been reported that PÃ kerman was in serious talks with the Australia national association football team , as well as talks with the Japan national football team about taking over the role as senior manager following the resignation of the respective coaches from each nation . Before the World Cup began , PÃ kerman made controversial decisions of dropping established defenders Javier Zanetti and Walter Samuel . When Argentina was eliminated by Germany in the quarterfinal , his substitution decision caused storms of criticism , as well . Despite the dramatic loss , PÃ kerman was still hailed by many fans and press as a very effective coach and the `` PÃ kerman Era '' is regarded as one that brought a lot of pride to the country . His team lost its temper after the elimination and started a huge brawl , which was believed to be one of the major factors that caused his resignation . PÃ kerman 's grandparents immigrated from Ukraine and settled in the Jewish colonies of Entre Rios province . PÃ kerman 's grandfather was fond of saying , probably in jest , that one of his nephews was Gregory Peck

Located in the fertile plain of Thessaly in central Greece , modern Trikala is the Homeric Trikka ( or Trikki ) , the birthplace of three of the Argonauts and the birthplace of Asclepius ( Asklepios ) . Ruins of an old sanctuary to the physician-god , an Asklepieion , or healing place , are located between the central square and the church of Saint Nicholas ( Agios Nikolaos ) in Trikala ; it is the oldest Aesculapium of Greece - a kind of medical center , from which the worship of Aesculapius gradually spread . There are other late Hellenistic and Roman period remains to be seen , mosaic floors , a stoa , and baths . Dominated by its Byzantine fortress on Hellenistic foundations occupying the ancient Acropolis , the picturesque city is divided in two by the river Lithaios , with the churches of Agios Demetrios and Agii Anargyri lending more Byzantine character to the modern town . She was managed by First Bulgarian Empire ( 920-922 , 977-983 , 996-997 ) due to occupations by Simeon I and Samuil .

The Stanley Cup winners were the Colorado Avalanche , who won the best of seven series 4 â `` 3 against the New Jersey Devils . The focus of Colorado 's Stanley Cup run was on star defenceman Raymond Bourque who was on a quest to win his first Stanley Cup championship in his illustrious 22-year career . Two expansion teams , the Minnesota Wild and the Columbus Blue Jackets , joined the league at the beginning of the season , increasing the number of NHL teams to 30 . The Blue Jackets would join the Central Division , while the Wild would join the Northwest Division . The divisions ' membership has remained static since ( as of 2011 ) . The Dallas Stars played their final season at the Reunion Arena , before moving to their new home in 2001 .

Thylacinus potens ( `` powerful thylacine '' ) was the largest species of the family Thylacinidae , known from a single poorly preserved fossil discovered by Michael O. Woodburne in 1967 in a Late Miocene locality near Alice Springs , Northern Territory . It preceded the modern thylacine by 4 â `` 6 million years , and was 5 % bigger , was more robust and had a shorter , broader skull . Its size is estimated to be similar to that of a gray wolf ; the head and body together were around 5 feet long , and its teeth were less adapted for shearing compared to those of the modern thylacine .

Roberto may have played for other teams but he will always be best known as a Botafogo striker .
The British Rail Class 15 diesel locomotives , also known as the BTH Type 1 , were designed by British Thomson-Houston , and built by the Yorkshire Engine Company and the Clayton Equipment Company , between 1957 and 1961 . Following the British Railways Modernisation Plan , ten of the class were ordered for evaluation under the ` pilot scheme ' . Like other locomotives designed to the ` Type 1 ' specification , they were intended for use on local freight and empty coaching stock trains . The design and manufacture was a collaboration between several companies . BTH ( the main contractor ) provided electrical equipment , Paxman supplied the power units , and Clayton supplied bogies and superstructure , with the frame construction and final assembly taking place at Yorkshire Engine 's Sheffield works . These ten locomotives , numbered D8200 â `` D8209 , entered service between November 1957 and November 1958 . The design showed sufficient promise for a repeat order for 34 more locomotives to be placed soon afterwards . These locomotives , numbered D8210 â `` D8243 and built by Clayton at Hatton , Derbyshire , were delivered between October 1959 and February 1961 . The first ten locomotives were delivered to the London Midland Region 's Devons Road depot in Bow , East London , where they were evaluated against the contemporary North British Type 1 and English Electric Type 1 designs . Soon , however , the entire class was allocated to depots on the Eastern Region , where they remained until withdrawal . The second block of ten was originally allocated to March depot in East Anglia , however due to the Clean Air Act 1956 the locomotives were quickly re-allocated to East London , allowing the replacement of steam locomotives in that area . Thereafter , the type was allocated exclusively to Stratford , Finsbury Park and Ipswich depots . The class were troubled by several reliability problems , notably with the engines which were found to require excessive maintenance . The layout , with a single cab positioned part-way down the body like a North American road-switcher , gave the crew poor forward visibility in both directions of travel , although this was initially tolerated as it was no worse than the visibility from a steam locomotive cab . Despite these problems the class were more successful than the contemporary Type 1 locomotives of Class 16 and the later Class 17 . With a decline in freight duties in the London area , and as a relatively small and non-standard class , the type was considered surplus to requirements by the late 1960s . All were withdrawn from capital stock between April 1968 and March 1971 . All but four had been broken up for scrap by the end of 1972 . The four that survived were converted into non-powered electric train pre-heating units at Doncaster Works , these duties keeping the locomotives employed for another ten years , until they were again made redundant and withdrawn . One of the former train heating units , D8233 , was purchased for preservation in 1984 and is now the only survivor of the type . It was originally kept at the South Yorkshire Railway in Sheffield , moving in 1986 to the East Lancashire Railway , and in 1988 to the Mangapps Farm Railway , where it remained until 1993 . D8233 then moved to Crewe following an agreement with the Waterman Heritage Trust . Since its initial preservation the locomotive had received little work apart from cosmetic attention . Some work was carried out by the Waterman Heritage Trust , however the locomotive 's restoration remained dormant until the end of 2005 , when a reformed owning group , alongside the WHT , agreed the time was right to accelerate the locomotive 's return to service . With an active plan for work agreed , the locomotive returned to the East Lancashire Railway in February 2006 , where its restoration to working order is now under way . A ready to run model in 00 gauge was available from TechCad design based on a hand finished resin shell and powered by a Mashima motor . It is now available from TechCad as a kit . Since 2010 Heljan have produced an OO gauge ready-to-run model in a variety of liveries . An N gauge kit of a member of the class is available from BH Enterprises , powered by a Graham Farish Class 20 chassis .
Johan Micoud ( born 24 July 1973 ) is a retired French footballer , who played mostly as an attacking midfielder . Left-footed , he was considered a skilled midfielder and a dead-ball expert ; during a 16-year professional career , he played professionally , other than in his country , in Italy and Germany . Born in Cannes , Micoud was a youth product of local AS Cannes ' youth system , becoming the side 's playmaker after Zinedine Zidane 's departure to FC Girondins de Bordeaux . He helped the club to promotion from the second division in 1993 and UEFA Cup qualification the following season . In 1998 â `` 99 , two years after also moving to Bordeaux , Micoud played a pivotal role as the club were crowned Ligue 1 champions , and helped it to the following season UEFA Champions League 's second group stage . In 2000 , he was seduced by the attraction of playing abroad , initially joining Parma FC , where he stayed for two seasons . Micoud then moved to Germany , signing for SV Werder Bremen , where he enjoyed a successful four-year stay , the peak of which being a major force in the league and cup double in 2004 , as he netted 10 league goals , the highest for a midfielder alongside Bayer 04 Leverkusen 's Bernd Schneider . In June 2006 , aged 33 , Micoud returned to France , re-joining the club where he first flourished , Bordeaux , enjoying immediate success as he scored the winner in his first league match back at the club , at FC Lorient ( 1 â `` 0 ) . He quickly became a key player in Bordeaux 's squad , helping it to win the 2007 League Cup and fight for the title the following season . However , after two solid seasons , Laurent Blanc announced on 10 May 2008 that Micoud 's contract would not be renewed at the end of the season , and the player subsequently retired from the game , one month shy of his 35th birthday . Despite being selected in the French national team on several occasions throughout his career , Micoud never managed to secure himself a regular starting role , mainly due to the presence of Zidane , whom occupied the same position . Courtesy of his stellar championship performances with Bordeaux , he made his debut on 17 August 1999 , in a friendly match with Northern Ireland , and was subsequently picked for the squad which won UEFA Euro 2000 , but he only played in one of the six matches of the tournament , in the group match against Netherlands , effectively a dead rubber given that both nations had already qualified both the group . He was also selected for the disastrous FIFA World Cup campaign of 2002 , during which he was entrusted with the key midfield role against Uruguay , only to turn in a largely unconvincing display in a disappointing 0 â `` 0 draw , mostly remembered for Thierry Henry 's red card . Regardless of his consistently high level of performance at club level , Micoud found himself subsequently marginalised by the following national selectors . Jacques Santini only selected him once , in a friendly match against Holland in 2004 , and he failed to make the squad for Euro 2004 , despite his Bremen performances . With Raymond Domenech , he did not win a single call-up for the 2006 World Cup qualifiers , with the finals to be held in Germany , the country where he delivered strong performances on a regular basis .

The dragon depicted on the side of the plane is `` Norman '' , the HBD Venture Capital mascot .
The Eye of the Heron is a 1978 science fiction novel by U.S. author Ursula K. Le Guin which was first published in the science fiction anthology Millennial Women . The Eye of the Heron is a science fiction novel set on the fictional planet of Victoria in a speculative future , probably sometime in the 22nd century , when the planet has been colonized for about a century and has no communication with Earth . The protagonist is a young woman called Luz but the story is told in the third person and the reader sees events from the point of view of several different characters . The Eye of the Heron is usually treated as one of Le Guin 's minor novels although it exhibits her characteristic prose style and themes . The title is a reference to a fictional animal on the planet Victoria which early colonists called heron because of some superficial similarities to Earth heron . The characters ' encounters with these animals occur at moments of significant introspection , particularly when they are considering that which they perceive as alien , or other , in relation to themselves . The planet of Victoria received two waves of colonists from Earth : first two prison ships founding a penal colony and then one ship of political exiles . The descendants of the prisoners mostly inhabit the City . The descendants of the political exiles , the `` People of Peace '' , inhabit Shantih Town , which is known to the City dwellers as Shanty Town . The Shantih Towners , whose primary occupation is farming , want to settle another valley further away from the City . The City `` Bosses '' do not want to lose the control they believe they have over the Shanty Towners and so they take action to try to prevent any settlement beyond their sphere of influence . The major themes in The Eye of the Heron are themes common to much of Le Guin 's fiction and include the social constructions of gender , interactions between individuals from different societies , intra-actions within societies , and contact with that which is perceived as alien or other . The novel also explores different forms of social and political organization by juxtaposing pacifist anarchism with violent oligarchy . The characters ' metaphorical internal journeys are reflected in literal external journeys throughout the plot . `` I gradually realized that my own fiction was telling me that I could no longer ignore the feminine . While I was writing The Eye of the Heron in 1977 , the hero insisted on destroying himself before the middle of the book . `` Hey , '' I said , `` you ca n't do that , you 're the hero . Where 's my book ? '' I stopped writing . The book had a woman in it , but I did n't know how to write about women . I blundered around a while and then found some guidance in feminist theory . I got excited when I discovered feminist literary criticism was something I could read and actually enjoy . I read The Norton Book of Literature by Women from cover to cover . It was a bible for me . It taught me that I did n't have to write like an honorary man anymore , that I could write like a woman and feel liberated in doing so . '' The Eye of the Heron contains the phrase : `` A beginning place '' . Le Guin reused this phrase in the title of her 1980 novel The Beginning Place . The Eye of the Heron refers to a fictional historical Long March which is probably an allusion to any of several historical marches for social and political freedom .
The Lady Byng Memorial Trophy , formerly known as the Lady Byng Trophy , is presented each year to the National Hockey League `` player adjudged to have exhibited the best type of sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability '' . The Lady Byng Memorial Trophy has been awarded 85 times to 51 different players since it was first awarded in 1925 . The voting is conducted at the end of the regular season by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association , and each individual voter ranks their top five candidates on a 10-7-5-3-1 points system . Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the Stanley Cup Playoffs . The trophy is named in honor of Marie Evelyn Moreton ( Lady Byng ) , wife of Viscount Byng of Vimy , a Vimy Ridge war hero who was Governor General of Canada from 1921 to 1926 . Lady Byng , who was an avid hockey fan , decided to donate the trophy to the NHL in 1925 . She decided the trophy 's first winner would be Frank Nighbor of the Ottawa Senators . Late in the season , Lady Byng invited Nighbor to Rideau Hall , showed him the trophy , and asked him if the NHL would accept it as an award for its most gentlemanly player . When Nighbor said he thought it would , Lady Byng , much to Nighbor 's surprise , awarded him the trophy . After Frank Boucher of the New York Rangers won the award seven times within eight years , Lady Byng was so impressed that she gave him the original trophy to keep . Lady Byng then donated a second trophy in 1935 â `` 36 . When Lady Byng died in 1949 the NHL presented another trophy and changed the official name to the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy . In 1962 , the original trophy was destroyed in a fire at Boucher 's home . Besides Boucher , a number of players have won the award multiple times , including Wayne Gretzky who won it five times , Red Kelly and Pavel Datsyuk with four wins , and Bobby Bauer , Alex Delvecchio , Mike Bossy and Ron Francis with three each . Because of Boucher 's seven wins , the New York Rangers have won the award the most out of any club , fifteen times , followed by Detroit with fourteen , Toronto with nine , Chicago and Boston tied with eight , and Los Angeles with five . Five players have won both the Lady Byng Trophy and the Hart Memorial Trophy as league MVP in the same season : Buddy O'Connor ( 1947 â `` 48 ) , Bobby Hull ( 1964 â `` 65 ) , Stan Mikita ( 1966 â `` 67 and 1967 â `` 68 ) , Wayne Gretzky ( 1979 â `` 80 ) and Joe Sakic ( 2000 â `` 01 ) . Mikita is also the only player to win the Hart , Art Ross , and Lady Byng trophies in the same season , doing so consecutively in the 1966 â `` 67 and 1967 â `` 68 seasons . Gretzky and Bobby Hull are the other players who have won these three awards in their career , though not in the same season , while Bobby and Brett Hull are the only father-son combination to win the Hart and Lady Byng trophies . Bill Quackenbush and Red Kelly are the only defensemen to have won the Lady Byng Trophy , since then no defenseman has won in over fifty years . No goaltender has ever won the award .

The library is open Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday & Saturday . Leinster ( Ë lÉ nstÉ r â '' â '' ) is one of the Provinces of Ireland . It lies in the east of Ireland and comprises the counties of Carlow , Dublin , Kildare , Kilkenny , Laois , Longford , Louth , Meath , Offaly , Westmeath , Wexford and Wicklow . The population of Leinster is 2,295,123 according to the 2006 census , making it the most populous province in the country . The traditional flag of Leinster features a golden harp on a green background . Although Dublin is considered a county in itself in terms of sport and culture , it contains several individual county councils . This is due to Dublin 's large population density , and they include DÃ n Laoghaire , Dublin City Council , Fingal and South Dublin . All the other counties in Leinster contain their own county councils individual to their own county . The only official city in Leinster is Dublin , the capital of Ireland . However , the Greater Dublin Area has a total population of 1,661,185 with some of its larger urban areas comprising the towns of Tallaght and its environs , Blanchardstown , Clondalkin and Lucan . The city of Kilkenny and its environs also has a sizeable population , but is not usually included as a city , despite holding that title for the past 400 years . According to the CSO regional income report , GDP for the province of Leinster in 2004 was estimated to be well over 75 billion Euro . The Gaelic Kingdom of Leinster before 1171 was considerably smaller than today 's province . The first part of the name Leinster derives from Laigin , the name of a major tribe that once inhabited the area . The latter part of the name derives either from the Irish tÃ r or the Old Norse staÃ r , both of which translate as `` land '' or `` territory '' . The tribes of Leinster were united by Ã gaine Mor ( Hugony , the Great ) , who supposedly built the hill-fort of DÃ n Ailinne , near Kilcullen , County Kildare . He is a likely , but uncertain candidate as the first historical king of Laigin ( Leinster ) in the 7th century BC . The kingdom of Laigin was re-founded circa 175\/185 AD following a period of civil wars in Ireland by the legendary Cathair Mor . Finn Mac Cool , or Fionn mac Cumhaill , was reputed to have built a stronghold at the Hill of Allen , on the edge of the Bog of Allen , in what was then Leinster . In the 4th and 5th centuries , after Magnus Maximus left Britain with his legions , leaving a power vacuum , colonists from Laigin settled in North Wales , specifically in Anglesey , Carnarvonshire and Denbighshire . In Wales some of the Leinster-Irish colonists left their name on the LlÅ n Peninsula , which derives its name from Laigin . After the death of the last Kildare-based King of Laigin , Murchad Mac Dunlainge in 1042 , the kingship of Leinster reverted to the UÃ Cheinnselaig sept based in the south east , now County Wexford . This southern dynasty gave all the later Kings of Leinster . Today , consisting of twelve counties , it encompasses the old province of Mide ( mostly now in modern-day County Meath and County Westmeath ) . Also in it are County Longford and the Annally and Lusmagh parishes of County Offaly , formerly of Connacht , and County Louth , formerly of Ulster . The borders were redrawn by Cromwell for administration and military reasons . The last major boundary changes occurred with the formation of County Wicklow ( 1603 â `` 1606 ) , from lands in the north of Carlow ( which previously extended to the sea ) and most of southern Dublin . Later minor changes dealt with `` islands '' of one county in another . By the late 18th century , Leinster looked as shown in the above map of 1784 . The Leinster of today represents the extented `` English Pale '' , counties controlled directly from Dublin , at the beginning of the seventheenth century . The other Provinces had their own regional Presidency systems , based on a Welsh model of administration , in theory if not in fact from the 1570s and 1580s up to the 1670s , and were considered separate entities .
See also Nonchord tone # Portamento . Portamento ( plural : portamenti , a noun meaning literally `` carriage '' or `` carrying '' ) is a musical term originated from the Italian expression `` portamento della voce '' ( carriage of the voice ) , denoting from the beginning of the 17th century a vocal slide between two pitches and its emulation by members of the violin family and certain wind instruments , and is sometimes used interchangeably with anticipation . It is also applied to one type of glissando as well as to the `` glide '' function of synthesizers . ( see main article glissando ) . In the first example , Rodolfo 's first aria in La Sonnambula ( 1831 ) , the portamento is indicated by the slur between the 3rd and 4th notes . The second example , Judit 's first line in Duke Bluebeard 's Castle ( 1912 ) , employs a more explicit notation ; it is unusual in that the termination of the slide ( shown as a grace note ) typically anticipates the pitch of the second note . Portamento may of course also be used for descending intervals . Although portamento continued to be widely used in popular music , it was disapproved of for operatic singing by many critics in the 1920s and 1930s as a sign of either poor technique , or of bad taste , a mark of cheap sentimentalism or showiness . This of course is not valid criticism of a performer when portamento is explicitly specified in the score or is otherwise appropriate . However , when there is no such specification , the singer is expected to be able to move crisply from note to note without any slurring or `` scooping '' .
Freedom of assembly , sometimes used interchangeably with the freedom of association , is the individual right to come together and collectively express , promote , pursue and defend common interests . The right to freedom of association is recognized as a human right , a political freedom and a civil liberty . Freedom of assembly and freedom of association may be used to distinguish between the freedom to assemble in public places and the freedom of joining an association . Freedom of assembly is often used in the context of the right to protest , while freedom of association is used in the context of labor rights and the right to collective bargaining , for example by joining a trade union . Freedom of assembly , as guaranteed in the Canadian Constitution and the Constitution of the United States , is interpreted to mean both the freedom to assemble and the freedom to join an association .
VÃ gner Silva de Souza ( born 11 June 1984 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil ) , commonly known as VÃ gner Love , is a Brazilian football striker who currently plays for CSKA Moscow . VÃ gner Love started his career with Palmeiras . In the 2003 season he helped them to return to the Brazilian SÃ rie A , the national First division . He was then bought by CSKA Moscow . In the summer of 2004 , prior to their Champions League campaign . For over a year after his arrival at CSKA Moscow , rumors kept appearing that he did not want to stay in Moscow , and a transfer to Corinthians in particular was hinted at numerous times . However , these rumors subsided and VÃ gner mentioned a number of times that he was fully committed to his contract and is looking forward to completing its full tenure . He scored the final goal that sealed CSKA 's 3-1 victory in the 2005 UEFA Cup Final over Sporting Clube de Portugal at the EstÃ dio JosÃ Alvalade in Lisbon . Additionally to this UEFA Cup final , he has gone on to win the Russian Premier League title and Russian Cup in 2005 , 2008 , and the Russian Super Cup in 2006 . He became the top scorer in the Russian Premier League 2008 , and the top scorer of the 2008 â `` 09 UEFA Cup , with 11 goals in eight games . On 28 August 2009 , following a run of poor form for CSKA Moscow , VÃ gner Love was signed by his former club Palmeiras on a one-year loan deal until 31 July 2010 . CSKA press spokesman Sergei Aksenov claimed that VÃ gner Love left Russia due to `` urgent family problems demand ( ing ) his presence at home in Brazil '' . Love had a respectable return of 5 goals in 12 games for Palmeiras , but the loan spell was to be short lived . After publicly stating his concern over his safety at Palmeiras due to off-field altercations with fans , as well as his desire to play for his childhood team Flamengo , VÃ gner Love 's loan contract with Palmeiras was ended early on 14 January 2010 . On 15 January 2010 , the day after his loan was terminated with Palmeiras , Love officially signed a loan deal with reigning Brazilian champions Flamengo lasting until July 2010 . He made his Flamengo debut against Bangu in the Campeonato Carioca on 23 January 2010 , scoring 2 goals .

VÃ gner Love is also member of the Brazilian national team and has played 21 games for the SeleÃ Ã # o.
In 2008 , the GP2 Asia Series also raced the same weekend . The Fiat Scudo is a medium-sized van . It is larger than the Fiat Doblo and smaller than the Fiat Ducato vans . The ` Combinato ' version , which is basically a normal Scudo van with rear seats and windows , is a popular vehicle of choice of taxi drivers , as their size can accommodate up to seven people . It has the same design as the CitroÃ `` n Jumpy and Peugeot Expert , as a joint venture between Fiat and PSA Peugeot CitroÃ `` n. The Fiat Scudo has a loading capacity from 850 t , including the driver , and load space of 4 m alone with an interior length of 2059 m. The unobstructed distance between wheel arches is 1220 m : these dimensions mean that 2 europallets can be loaded into the vehicle . The Scudo is built with a choice of two diesel engines and one gasoline . Diesel engines were either the 69 P 1.9 D , or the 109 P 2.0 JTD and the gasoline engine was 1,6 ( 1581 cc 58 kW ) . In 2007 was introduced new version , externally designed to be similar than the new Fiat Ducato , also new engine versions came available . The cargo ability varies from 5 t and the combi version can transport five to nine people . Carrying capacity varies between 1000 a. Formula 1 driver Michael Schumacher was also featured in a commercial of the Fiat Scudo .
A stink bomb or stinkbomb is a device designed to create an unpleasant smell . They range in effectiveness from simple pranks to military grade or riot control chemical agents . The Guinness Book of Records lists two smelliest substances . One is `` US Government Standard Bathroom Malodor '' ; a mixture of eight chemicals with a stench resembling human feces , only much stronger , designed to test the efficacy of deodorizers and air fresheners . Another one , `` Who me ? '' , is a mixture of five sulfur-containing chemicals and smells like rotting food and carcasses . At one end of the spectrum , relatively harmless stink bombs consist of ammonium sulfide , which smells strongly of rotten eggs . When exposed to air , the ammonium sulfide reacts with moisture , hydrolyzes , and a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and ammonia is released . Other popular substances on which to base stink bombs are thiols with lower molecular weight , e.g. , methyl mercaptan and ethyl mercaptanâ '' the chemicals that give odor to skunks and are added in minute quantities to natural gas in order to make gas leaks detectable by smell . A variation on this idea is the scent bomb , or perfume bomb , filled with an overpowering `` cheap perfume '' smell . At the other end of the spectrum , the governments of Israel and the United States of America are developing stink bombs for use by their law enforcement agencies and militaries as riot control and area denial weapons . Using stink bombs for these purposes have advantages over traditional riot control agents : unlike pepper spray and tear gas , stink bombs are believed not to be dangerous , and they are effective at low concentrations . Prank stink bombs and perfume bombs are usually sold as a 1 - or 2-ml sealed glass ampoule , which can be broken by throwing against a hard surface or by crushing under one 's shoe sole , thus releasing the odorous liquid contained therein . Another variety of prank stink bomb comprises two bags , one smaller and inside the other . The inner one contains a liquid and the outer one a powder . When the inner one is popped by squeezing it , the liquid reacts with the powder , producing hydrogen sulfide , which expands and pops the outer bag , releasing an unpleasant odor . Typically , lower molecular weight volatile organic compounds are used . Generally the higher molecular weight for a given class of compounds , the lower volatility and initial concentration but the longer persistence . Some chemicals ( typically thiols ) have a certain concentration threshold over which the smell is not perceived significantly stronger ; therefore a lower-volatility compound is capable of providing comparable stench intensity to a higher-volatility compound , but for longer time . Another issue is the operating temperature , on which the compound 's volatility strongly depends . Care should be taken as some compounds are toxic either in higher concentration or after prolonged exposure in low concentration . Some plants may be used as improvised stink bombs , One such plant is the Parkia speciosa or ` stinky bean ' , which grows in India , Southeast Asia and Eastern Australia . The pods from this plant are collected when partly dried and stamped on , to release the stink .
The Glasgow Garden Festival was the third of the United Kingdom 's five National Garden Festivals , and the only one to take place in Scotland . It was held in Glasgow between 26 April and 26 September 1988 . It was the first event of its type to be held in the city in 50 years , since the Empire Exhibition of 1938 , and also marked the centenary of Glasgow 's first International Exhibition , the International Exhibition of Science , Art and Industry of 1888 . It attracted 4.3 million visitors over 152 days , by far the most successful of the five National Garden Festivals . Its significance in the rebirth of the city was underlined by the 1990 European City of Culture title bestowed on Glasgow in September 1986 . The two events together did much to restore Glasgow to national and international prominence . The festival site covered 120 a , including 17 of water , on the south bank of the River Clyde at Pacific Quay in Govan , and also on land reclaimed from the partial filling-in of the Prince 's Dock basin . Once the largest dock on the River Clyde when opened in 1900 , it had been closed to navigation in the early 1970s with the advent of Containerization . Glasgow Garden Festival 1988 Ltd. , a subsidiary of the Scottish Development Agency , managed the event . Features included the 240 f high Clydesdale Bank 150th Anniversary Tower , the Coca-Cola Roller roller coaster , a miniature railway and five former Glasgow Corporation Tramways vintage trams running again in the city along the riverside . A new swing bridge , Bell 's Bridge , sponsored by the Distillers Company Limited , had been constructed across the river to link the Garden Festival to the SECC , which held the Grand International Show in its Hall 4 in conjunction with the festival . The official opening ceremony took place on 29 April and was conducted by Prince Charles and Princess Diana . The event had significant media coverage , including daily BBC TV magazine shows , The Beechgrove Garden and radio features , the festival was also used as a backdrop for the Taggart episode Root Of Evil . After the end of the festival , the site was expected to be developed for housing , but the original developers , Laing Homes , had sold up before the event due to the housing slump in 1987 , and most of the 100 a of land was then owned by Grosvenor Estates or the City Council . Like the other Garden Festivals , which had all promised a speedy post-event development to capitalize on the popularity of the occasion , the majority of the site remained derelict for years . Parts were finally redeveloped for the Glasgow Science Centre and also Pacific Quay , which includes a media campus that provides new headquarters for BBC Scotland and Scottish Television , opened in 2007 . The Clydesdale Bank tower was dismantled and re-erected in Rhyl in North Wales , however its spiritual successor came in the form of the Glasgow Millennium Tower as part of Science Centre complex , which stands on approximately the same spot .

Alexis Margaret Herman ( born July 16 , 1947 in Mobile , Alabama ) was the 23rd U.S. Secretary of Labor , serving under President Bill Clinton . Prior to her appointment , she was Assistant to the President and Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement . The daughter of politician Alex Herman and schoolteacher Gloria Caponis , Alexis grew up a Catholic home in Mobile and earned her high school diploma in 1965 from the Heart of Mary High School . She briefly attended Edgewood College in Madison , Wisconsin , and Spring Hill College in Mobile , but transferred to Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans , where she became an active member of the Gamma Alpha Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority , Inc. and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology in 1969 . Herman was Queen of Carnival for the Mobile Area Mardi Gras Association ( Mobile 's African-American Mardi Gras umbrella organization ) in 1974 . Her king , Douglas Wicks , would go on to become the first African-American elected to the Mobile County Commission since Reconstruction . After college , Herman worked for Catholic Charities and other agencies advocating minority women employment . Jimmy Carter met the young Herman while campaigning in Atlanta , Georgia and , after winning the White House in 1977 , tapped her to be Director of the Labor Department 's Women 's Bureau . At age 29 , she was the youngest person to ever serve in that position . In 1981 , Herman founded her own consulting firm - A.M. Herman & Associates . She served as president of the company while remaining active in Democratic politics . During her tenure as chief of staff and later vice chair of the Democratic National Committee , she was responsible for organizing the 1992 Democratic National Convention . After Bill Clinton 's victory in the 1992 Presidential election , Herman became deputy director of the Presidential Transition Office . She was later appointed to head the White House Office of Public Liaison , where she was responsible for the administration 's relations with interest groups . During Clinton 's second term , Herman was named Secretary of Labor , the first African American to be nominated for that position and the fifth woman to be appointed . Her nomination was initially opposed by Congressional Republicans and labor unions , but she earned praise from her peers for her handling of the 1997 UPS workers strike . She came under investigation for taking cash bribe and\/or illegal campaign donations as an aide to Clinton from 1994 to 1996 . She was the 5th cabinet officer be investigated by independent counsel . Bill Clinton testified on her behalf . In 2000 the investigation ended with no indictment . During the 2000 Florida election recount , Herman was part of team planning a transition to a Gore Administration , and she was mentioned as a likely candidate for White House Chief of Staff . She was replaced as Secretary of Labor in the George W. Bush administration by Elaine Chao . Herman now serves as the co-chairperson ( with James Roosevelt , Jr. ) of the Democratic National Committee 's Rules and Bylaws Committee . Herman also now serves on the boards of several major companies , including Coca Cola Corporation 's Human Resources Task Force , Toyota 's Diversity Advisory Board , Cummins , Metro Goldwyn Mayer , and Prudential and is the chairman and CEO of New Ventures , Inc.
Calcite is a carbonate mineral and the most stable polymorph of calcium carbonate ( CaCO3 ) . The other polymorphs are the minerals aragonite and vaterite . Aragonite will change to calcite at 380-470 Â C , and vaterite is even less stable . Calcite crystals are trigonal-rhombohedral , though actual calcite rhombohedra are rare as natural crystals . However , they show a remarkable variety of habits including acute to obtuse rhombohedra , tabular forms , prisms , or various scalenohedra . Calcite exhibits several twinning types adding to the variety of observed forms . It may occur as fibrous , granular , lamellar , or compact . Cleavage is usually in three directions parallel to the rhombohedron form . Its fracture is conchoidal , but difficult to obtain . It has a defining Mohs hardness of 3 , a specific gravity of 2.71 , and its luster is vitreous in crystallized varieties . Color is white or none , though shades of gray , red , orange , yellow , green , blue , violet , brown , or even black can occur when the mineral is charged with impurities . Calcite is transparent to opaque and may occasionally show phosphorescence or fluorescence . A transparent variety called Iceland spar is used for optical purposes . Acute scalenohedral crystals are sometimes referred to as `` dogtooth spar '' while the rhombohedral form is sometimes referred to as `` nailhead spar '' . Single calcite crystals display an optical property called birefringence ( double refraction ) . This strong birefringence causes objects viewed through a clear piece of calcite to appear doubled . The birefringent effect ( using calcite ) was first described by the Danish scientist Rasmus Bartholin in 1669 . At a wavelength of ~ 590 nm calcite has ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices of 1.658 and 1.486 , respectively . Between 190 and 1700 nm , the ordinary refractive index varies roughly between 1.6 and 1.4 , while the extraordinary refractive index varies between 1.9 and 1.5 . Calcite , like most carbonates , will dissolve with most forms of acid . Calcite can be either dissolved by groundwater or precipitated by groundwater , depending on several factors including the water temperature , pH , and dissolved ion concentrations . Although calcite is fairly insoluble in cold water , acidity can cause dissolution of calcite and release of carbon dioxide gas . Calcite exhibits an unusual characteristic called retrograde solubility in which it becomes less soluble in water as the temperature increases . When conditions are right for precipitation , calcite forms mineral coatings that cement the existing rock grains together or it can fill fractures . When conditions are right for dissolution , the removal of calcite can dramatically increase the porosity and permeability of the rock , and if it continues for a long period of time may result in the formation of caverns , most notably the Snowy River Cave in Lincoln County , New Mexico . The largest documented single crystals of calcite originated from Iceland , measured 7 Ã -- 7 Ã -- 2 m and 6 Ã -- 6 Ã -- 3 m and weighed about 250 tons . Calcite is a common constituent of sedimentary rocks , limestone in particular , much of which is formed from the shells of dead marine organisms . Approximately 10 % of sedimentary rock is limestone . Calcite is the primary mineral in metamorphic marble . It also occurs as a vein mineral in deposits from hot springs , and it occurs in caverns as stalactites and stalagmites . Calcite may also be found in volcanic or mantle-derived rocks such as carbonatites , kimberlites , or rarely in peridotites . Lublinite is a fibrous , efflorescent form of calcite . Calcite is often the primary constituent of the shells of marine organisms , e.g. , plankton ( such as coccoliths and planktic foraminifera ) , the hard parts of red algae , some sponges , brachiopods , echinoderms , most bryozoa , and parts of the shells of some bivalves ( such as oysters and rudists ) . Calcite is found in spectacular form in the Snowy River Cave of New Mexico as mentioned above , where microorganisms are credited with natural formations . Trilobites , which are now extinct , had unique compound eyes . They used clear calcite crystals to form the lenses of their eyes . Calcite seas existed in Earth history when the primary inorganic precipitate of calcium carbonate in marine waters was low-magnesium calcite ( lmc ) , as opposed to the aragonite and high-magnesium calcite ( hmc ) precipitated today . Calcite seas alternated with aragonite seas over the Phanerozoic , being most prominent in the Ordovician and Jurassic . Lineages evolved to use whichever morph of calcium carbonate was favourable in the ocean at the time they became mineralised , and retained this mineralogy for the remainder of their evolutionary history . Petrographic evidence for these calcite sea conditions consists of calcitic ooids , lmc cements , hardgrounds , and rapid early seafloor aragonite dissolution . The evolution of marine organisms with calcium carbonate shells may have been affected by the calcite and aragonite sea cycle .
Disulfur decafluoride ( S2F10 ) is a gas discovered in 1934 by Denbigh and Whytlaw-Gray . Each S of the S2F10 molecule is octahedral , and surrounded by 5 fluorines . S2F10 is highly toxic , with toxicity similar to phosgene . It was considered a potential chemical warfare pulmonary agent in World War II because it does not produce lacrimation or skin irritation , thus providing little warning of exposure . It is a possible by-product of electrically decomposed SF6 gas -- an essentially inert insulator used in high voltage systems such as transmission lines , substations and switchgear . S2F10 is also made during the production of SF6 , but is distilled out . This compound contains sulfur in the +5 oxidation state . At temperatures above 150 Â C , decomposes slowly to and . reacts with to give . It reacts with to form in the presence of ultraviolet radiation . The analogous reaction with bromine is reversible , and yields . The reversibility of this reaction can be used to synthesize from . Ammonia is oxidised by into ( ( Thiazyl trifluoride ) ) . is a colorless , odorless liquid about 4 times as poisonous as phosgene ; a single breath can kill within a day . Its toxicity is thought to be caused by its disproportionation in the lungs into , which is inert , and , which reacts with moisture to form sulfurous acid and hydrofluoric acid .

Mike E. Clark is an American record producer and DJ from Detroit , Michigan . Clark has worked with musicians in various genres , including George Clinton and Kid Rock , but is best known for his work with Insane Clown Posse , for which he has produced nine studio albums . Clark has produced solo material for members Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope , in addition to contributing production to artists signed to the Psychopathic Records label founded by Insane Clown Posse . Clark was raised in Roseville , Michigan , and took an early interest in music . The first album Clark received , a greatest hits compilation by Sonny & Cher , was a Valentine 's Day gift from his mother . Clark later discovered Elton John , The Rolling Stones , Sex Pistols and The Stooges . After graduating from high school , Clark took classes on music production at the Recording Institute in Eastpointe , Michigan , and soon got a job at the The Disc Ltd. . Clark worked as an assistant engineer on Patti Smith 's `` Wild Leaves , '' the B-side of the single `` People Have the Power , '' which appeared on Smith 's 1988 album Dream of Life . During this period , Clark met Kid Rock , and helped produce demos that led to Jive Records signing the aspiring rapper . Clark 's talent for producing hip hop music earned him the nickname `` The Funky Honky '' . For Kid Rock 's debut album , Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast , Clark produced the single `` Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley . '' During the recording of Insane Clown Posse 's Carnival of Carnage , the group 's manager , Alex Abbiss , hired Clark to produce the album , which featured appearances from Esham and Kid Rock . Clark continued to work with the group and various associated acts on its label , Psychopathic Records . Clark has been involved with the production of albums by George Clinton , R. L. Burnside , and Primal Scream . In 2000 , Clark began working on Dark Lotus ' debut album , Tales from the Lotus Pod , and Insane Clown Posse 's sixth and seventh albums , Bizzar and Bizaar , but had a falling-out with members Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler . According to Clark , `` It seemed like too much was going on , and I was n't sure about the material . I needed a break . I was frazzled , we were n't getting along , so that was it . '' Clark produced four songs for Tales from the Lotus Pod ; the album 's production was completed by Twiztid producer Fritz the Cat . Clark and rapper Prozak formed the group Project : Deadman , releasing its debut album , Self Inflicted , in 2004 , and touring the United States for six months . That year , Clark became a full-time engineer for Kid Rock . Clark contracted pneumonia , but ignored the illness , and began coughing severely as he awoke , leading to a three month stay in Mount Clemens General Hospital , during which one of his lungs collapsed three times . As the result of his near-death experience , Clark decided to reconcile with Bruce and Utsler . Phone conversations between Clark and Insane Clown Posse led to Clark producing Utsler 's 2006 solo album F.T.F.O. . In 2007 , Clark produced the Kid Rock single `` All Summer Long , '' which was musically based upon a mash-up of Warren Zevon 's `` Werewolves of London '' and Lynyrd Skynyrd 's `` Sweet Home Alabama . '' The same year , Clark produced Insane Clown Posse 's tenth album The Tempest , but did not work with the group directly . In 2009 , Clark produced the group 's eleventh studio album , Bang ! Pow ! Boom ! , the first album that Clark worked on directly with Bruce and Utsler since Bizaar . Clark 's production style has been the subject of appraisal , as some critics view Clark 's production as being the most appealing element of Insane Clown Posse 's music . In his review of The Amazing Jeckel Brothers , Rolling Stone writer Barry Walters wrote that Clark 's production incorporates elements of `` carnival organ riffs , power chords and shotgun blasts ... banjolike plucking and Van Halen-esque guitar squeals . '' In Allmusics review of The Tempest , David Jeffries wrote that Clark `` cleverly borrows from whatever genre he feels like '' and that `` there 's no denying that Clark 's vision does wonders for the duo . ''

Sneek is a city southwest of Leeuwarden and the former seat of the Municipality Sneek in the province of Friesland ( Netherlands ) . As for 2011 it is part of the municipality SÃ dwest FryslÃ cents n. The city has approximately 33.000 inhabitants . Sneek is situated in Southwest-Friesland , close to the Sneekermeer and is well known for its canals , the Waterpoort ( Watergate , the symbol of the city ) , and watersport ( Sneekweek ) . Sneek is one of the Friese elf steden ( Eleven cities ) . The city is very important for the southwest area of Friesland ( the `` Zuidwesthoek '' ) . Sneek is built around a waterway ( in old documents called the Magna Fossa ) The waterway to the north ( Geeuw , Sneeker Oudvaart ) was needed because the Middelzee was silted . The old hemdijk comes in as the `` Hemdijk '' , turns into the `` Oude Dijk '' and becomes the `` Wijde en Nauwe Noorderhornes '' before it goes on as the `` Peperstraat '' and the `` Wijde en Nauwe Burgstraten '' , it is eventually the base of the busy shoppingstreet the `` Oosterdijk '' , and leaves the city as the `` Griene Dyk '' . Sneek received several city rights in the 13th century , which became official in 1456 . Sneek was now one of the eleven Frisian cities . This was also the beginning of a blooming trading city that would last until the year 1550 . In 1492 they began building a ditch and wall around the city . In those days Sneek was the only city in Friesland that had a wall . Only the waterpoort and the bolwerk are remaining today . Since September 10 , 1970 , Sneek and the Japanese city Kurobe have been sister cities . in 1970 Mayor L. Rasterhoff of Sneek visited the city of Kurobe and was named a Honorary citizen . Mayor H. Terade of Kurobe made a visit to Sneek in 1972 . In 2000 delegations of both cities visited each other again . The Japanese showed the citizens of Sneek a `` Sneekplein '' which was built in Kurobe . Sneek has its own dialect that dates back to the Dutch language in 1600 . Snekers is part of the city Frisian dialects . The famous clothingstore C&A started in 1861 with a store in Sneek . The Candyfactory Tonnema produces Peppermint under the name KING . This name has nothing to do with the English word KING , it stands for `` Quality equaled in nothing '' . Also Sneek has a Steel , Machinery and a Rope factory . Since 1964 a factory of Yoshida YKK from Kurobe . besides that , the Supermarket branch Poiesz , Clothing brand Gaastra and the old Frisian gin called beerenburg from Weduwe Joustra are products that have their roots in Sneek . Sneek is well known as the center of watersports with over 130 Watersport-company 's and 13 Marinas . Also it has a monumental inner-city with the old and famous gentlemen 's houses . Sneek is accessible by public transport ; buses in the region are operated by Connexxion and trains are operated by Arriva . The following waterways connect Sneek with other cities . In 2010 there will be a Cultural Quarter , The municipal has made plans to connect various Cultural areas into one big Cultural Quarter . the total costs of the plans are about 35,000,000 and includes The Culture Award of Sneek is called The Silver Ball and has been awarded 11 times . The Awards is given annually to a person that has done a improvement\/good job on the areas of Music and Culture for Sneek and the area around it . the winners of the previous awards are : Sneek has around 14.000 houses . Half of those houses are rental houses . there are new projects in different neighborhoods going on , besides the building of new houses , there are plenty of existing rental or normal houses for various prices . In 1519 1520 , the Frisian warlord and freedom fighter Pier Gerlofs Donia spend his last days in Sneek . Donia died peacefully in bed at Grootzand 12 on 18 October 1520 . Pier is buried in Sneek in the 15th-century Groote Kerk ( also called the Martinikerk ) . His tomb is located on the north side of the church . This quaint little city has a shopping center that is walker and biker friendly . There are high-end clothing stores , restaurants , bars , music stores , cafes , coffee shops , and an old-fashioned candy store .
Herne is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia , Germany . It is located in the Ruhr area directly between the cities of Bochum and Gelsenkirchen . Like most other cities in the region Herne was a tiny village until the 19th century . When the mining of coal and the production of steel began , the villages of the Ruhr area became cities . Present-day Herne includes the former settlements of Herne , Wanne and Eickel . Farms bearing these names were founded in the 11th and 12th centuries . In 1860 the first coal mine started operation . In the following thirty years the population increased twentyfold . For the first time Herne was called a city . The same process took place in Wanne and Eickel , which merged in 1926 to form the new city of Wanne-Eickel . In 1975 Wanne-Eickel , by then a city with over 70,000 inhabitants , was incorporated into Herne . ; World War II Herne was targeted by the RAF on 4 June 1940 , early in World War II . Three high-explosive bombs were dropped and one house was damaged . In Wanne-Eickel , the Krupp Treibstoffwerke oil refinery near the local Shamrock 3\/4 coal mine was bombed during the Oil Campaign of World War II . A fair called Cranger Kirmes is held in the city 's Crange district every August . This is the second largest carnival in Germany with an average of around 4,500,000 visitors . Its origins can be traced back to the 15th century , when farmers started trading horses on Saint Lawrenceâ s Day . That is why the official opening always takes place on the first Friday in August . The horse market tradition is kept up , by arranging a horse show and horse equipment sales at the same place where horses were traded years ago . Today there are about 500 stalls every year covering 111,000 square metres , meaning that it takes a 5 kilometre walk to see the whole fairground . Among other things you can buy sugared almonds and all kinds of other food , visit beer gardens , win prizes in shooting galleries or tombolas , or enjoy traditional and new rides like roundabouts , ghost trains and all sorts of high-tech delights . One of the main attractions is the 60-metre high big wheel that is the largest movable one in the world . Famous Hernians or Wanne-Eickelians include JÃ 1\/4 rgen von Manger , Kurt Edelhagen , JÃ 1\/4 rgen Marcus , Heinz RÃ 1\/4 hmann , Tana Schanzara , Dr. Claudia Dollins ( Geier ) , YÄ ldÄ ray BaÅ tÃ 1\/4 rk , Jan Zweyer , Peavy Wagner , Leonie Saint and BÃ rbel Beuermann . The composer Ralf Linke lives in Herne .

The Port of Kaohsiung is the largest harbor in Taiwan , handling approximately 10 million twenty-foot equivalent units ( TEU ) worth of cargo in 2007 . The port is located in southern Taiwan , adjacent to Kaohsiung City , surrounded by the city districts of Gushan , Yancheng , Lingya , Cianjhen , Siaogang , and Cijin . It is administrated by Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau , a division under the Ministry of Transportation of Executive Yuan , the central government of Taiwan ( Republic of China ) . The port was a natural lagoon before being eventually developed through into a modern harbor over the period of several hundred years . At the time of 16th century , some villages had already established on the seashore of the present-day Kaohsiung , which was called as `` Takau '' by natives at that time . The colonists of Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) arrived at Takau in 1620s and then began to develop the lagoon . The port , in which referred to as the `` Takau Port '' ( æ `` ç -- æ ) , grew up slowly during the Dutch Era , Koxinga Era , and the early Qing Dynasty . In 1858 , the Qing Dynasty lost the Second Opium War to the French-British and signed the Treaties of Tianjin . According to the treaties , the Qing 's government was asked to open five ports of Taiwan for foreign trade . As one of the five ports , Takao Port had officially opened to the western traders since 1864 . Afterward , the Qing 's government ceded Taiwan to Japanese in 1895 after losing First Sino-Japanese War . In the early Japanese-ruled era , the colonial government decided to undertake large projects with the intention to develop the port into a modern harbor . Japanese built the port up in three stages , the first was finished in 1908 , the second in 1912 , and the third was halted half way after the World War II broke up . During World War II , the port was heavily bombed of Allies . After the war , government of Republic of China restarted the development of the port . The `` second port '' was built in 1975 by breaking the land bridge between Siaogang and Cijin .
San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca is a city in northwestern Argentina and capital of Catamarca Province , on the RÃ o Valle River , at the feet of the Cerro Ambato . The city of 684 k , located 500 m above the sea level , has 141,000 inhabitants , with more than 200,000 counting the suburbia , what represents around 70 % of the population of the province . The city is located 1130 k from Buenos Aires . The closest provincial capitals are La Rioja ( 154 k ) , TucumÃ n ( 230 k ) and Santiago del Estero ( 209 k ) . Many pilgrims come to San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca to visit the Church of the Virgin of the Valley ( 1694 ) , which contains a statue of Nuestra SeÃ ora del Valle ( Our Lady of the Valley ) . Catamarca is also the touristic center of the province , with its colonial architecture , and serves as a hub to many touristic points and excursions , hiking , mountain-bike tours , horse riding , and wine tasting . San Fernando del Valle is served by Coronel Felipe Varela International Airport ) ( CTC\/SANC ) , with flights to IRJ , TUC and AEP . An initial settlement , called Londres , was established here by Spanish colonists in 1558 ; a permanent settlement was not founded until 1683 , by Fernando de Mendoza y Mate de Luna . Catamarca comes from Quechua meaning `` fortress on the slope '' . The city , which had only 8,000 inhabitants in 1882 and was reached by a railway line in 1888 , grew very slowly , and the region remained poor even in the middle of the 20th century . This situation was exacerbated by nepotism on the part of the ruling Saadi family , before they lost political power in the 1990s . In spite of this , the province remains still politically unstable , and a large part of its population lives in precarious conditions . The arid continental mild climate of the zone has an annual average of 20 Â C with an average maximum temperature of 34 Â C in summer with several days exceeding 43 Â C and an average minimum of 5 Â C in winter . Temperature in the high mountains can drop down to 30 Â C below zero . The Valle ( valley ) receives little rainfall annually . Most of the precipitation is received in the form of snow on the high mountain tops surrounding the city . Agriculture is San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca 's chief economic activity ; however , low rainfall makes irrigation necessary . Fruit and grapes are grown in the oasis areas near the city , and there 's a considerable production of wine . Other local production includes preserves and handwoven ponchos . Cotton and cattle are important economically , as well as mining at the FarallÃ n Negro , Bajo de la Alumbrera and Capillitas mines where gold , silver , copper and tin .
`` Nicky '' Hilton can also refer to Conrad Hilton , Jr. Nicholai Olivia `` Nicky '' Hilton ( born October 5 , 1983 ) is an American fashion model , socialite , celebutante , and fashion designer . She is a great-granddaughter of Conrad Hilton ( founder of Hilton Hotels ) . Hilton was born in New York City , and grew up in Los Angeles . Her father is Richard Hilton , a businessman , and her mother is Kathy Hilton ( Avanzino ) , a socialite and actress . She grew up with three siblings : Paris Hilton , Barron Nicholas Hilton II , and Conrad Hughes Hilton III . She attended Convent of the Sacred Heart and graduated in 2001 . In 2004 , Hilton launched her own clothing line . She also designed a line of handbags for Japanese company Samantha Thavasa . In 2007 , she started her second line aimed at a more mature audience and higher pricepoint , called Nicholai , which had its debut fashion show for the spring\/summer 2008 season on September 9 , 2007 in New York City during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week . In 2005 , Hilton , along with Kimberly Stewart , was the face of Australian underwear line Antz Pantz . Stewart remains contracted , however Hilton has since been replaced by Australian up-and-coming model Megan Maitland . Around this time , Hilton modeled for the cover of Lucire magazine for its New Zealand and Romanian editions . In 2006 , she entered a partnership to open two Nicky O Hotels , the first in Miami and the second in Chicago . On February 12 , 2007 , Hilton was sued for breach of contract by her partners . On September 21 , 2010 Nicky and her sister Paris Hilton were stopped by immigration officers at Narita Airport , Japan because of Paris ' conviction for drug possession a day earlier ; under Japan 's strict anti-drug laws , all people sentenced for any drug crime are , in general , rejected entry to the country . The Hiltons were due to appear at a news conference in Tokyo on September 22 to promote Paris Hilton 's fashion and fragrance lines along with her sister Nicky . According to the Hiltons ' publicists , Narita Airport 's immigration office questioned Hilton `` for hours '' . Paris and Nicky were forced to stay close to the airport at a hotel as officials would determine what to do on September 22 . It is unlikely that the Hiltons will be able to continue their Asian promotion tour , as they are about to enter countries like Indonesia and Malaysia , with even tougher anti-drug laws than Japan . In 2004 , Hilton married businessman Todd Andrew Meister at the Las Vegas Wedding Chapel . The marriage was annulled shortly after .

Grace Anna Goodhue Coolidge ( January 3 , 1879 â `` July 8 , 1957 ) was the wife of Calvin Coolidge and First Lady of the United States from 1923 to 1929 . Born in Burlington , Vermont , the only child of Andrew Issaclar Goodhue ( 1848 â `` 1923 ) , a mechanical engineer and steamboat inspector , and Lemira Barrett Goodhue ( 1849 â `` 1929 ) , Grace graduated from the University of Vermont in 1902 , where she was a founding member of the Beta chapter of Pi Beta Phi sorority . She then joined the faculty of the Clarke School for the Deaf in Northampton , Massachusetts , as a lip reading instructor . While watering flowers outside the school one day in 1903 , she happened to look up at the open window of Robert N. Weir 's boardinghouse and caught a glimpse of Calvin Coolidge shaving in front of a mirror with nothing on but long underwear and a hat . She burst out laughing at the sight ; he heard the noise and turned to look at her . It was their first meeting . After a more formal introduction sometime later , the two were quickly attracted to each other . Grace 's vivacity and charm proved a perfect complement to Coolidge 's reserved manner . In the summer of 1905 , Coolidge proposed in the form of an ultimatum : `` I am going to be married to you . '' Grace readily consented , but her mother objected and did everything she could to postpone the wedding . Coolidge never reconciled with his mother-in-law , who later insisted that Grace had been largely responsible for Coolidge 's political success . On October 4 , 1905 , Coolidge ( age 33 ) married Grace Goodhue ( age 26 ) at the home of the bride 's parents at 312 Maple Street in Burlington . The small wedding , attended by 15 guests , was performed by the Reverend Edward A. Hungerford . The newlyweds planned a two-week honeymoon to Montreal , Canada , but at Coolidge 's suggestion cut it short at the end of one week and settled at Northampton . Mrs. Coolidge , although raised a Democrat , adopted the party of her husband . Grace Coolidge may be credited a full share in her husband 's rise in politics . She worked hard , kept up appearances , took her part in town activities , attended her church , and offset his shyness with a gay friendliness . As Coolidge was rising to the office of governor , the family kept the duplex ; he rented a dollar-and-a-half room in Boston and came home on weekends . In 1921 , as wife of the Vice President , Grace Coolidge went from her housewife 's routine into Washington society and quickly became the most popular woman in the capital . After Harding 's death and Calvin Coolidge 's succession to the Presidency , she planned the new administration 's social life as her husband wanted it : unpretentious but dignified . As First Lady , she was a popular hostess . The social highlight of the Coolidge years was the party for Charles Lindbergh following his transatlantic flight in 1927 . The Coolidges were a particularly devoted couple , although the president never discussed state matters with her . She did not even know that he had decided not to seek re-election in 1928 until he announced it to the press . She received a gold medal from the National Institute of Social Science . In 1931 she was voted one of America 's twelve greatest living women . Calvin Coolidge summed up his marriage to Grace in his autobiography : `` For almost a quarter of a century she was borne with my infirmities , and I have rejoiced in her graces . '' For greater privacy in Northampton , the Coolidges bought `` The Beeches , '' a large house with spacious grounds . Calvin died there in 1933 . After Calvin 's death , Grace Coolidge continued her work on behalf of the deaf . During World War II , she was active in the Red Cross , civil defense , and scrap drives . She kept her sense of fun and her aversion to publicity until her death on July 8 , 1957 at 78 . She is buried next to her husband at Plymouth , Vermont .

North Weald tube station is a former London Underground station in Essex , England . It was located between Epping and Blake Hall stations on the Central line , serving North Weald . The station was opened by the Eastern Counties Railway on 1 April 1865 , serving principally as a goods station taking agricultural produce from the nearby farms into central London . During World War II , it was frequently used by airmen traveling to and from the nearby North Weald Airfield . Steam locomotives operated by British Rail for the London Underground ran a shuttle service from Epping to Ongar ( stopping at North Weald ) from 1949 to 1957 , when the track was electrified and taken over by the Underground 's Central Line . While the Epping to Ongar branch was normally operated as an isolated section of the Central Line , for two days every year trains were run from London to terminate at North Weald . These trains served the North Weald airshow on the Saturday and Sunday of its opening at the aerodrome almost adjacent to the station . The normal Epping to Ongar shuttle dovetailed with this service passing the terminating train on the adjacent line during its southbound journey . The line from Epping to Ongar is a single track line with the exception of North Weald station which functioned as the only available passing place for trains traveling in opposite directions . The station 's two platforms were both used from 1949 until 1976 when the westbound track was lifted . Until this time , access to the two platforms was controlled from the original Eastern Counties Railway signal box still sited on the southbound platform to this day . Until this occurred , North Weald was the last section of the London Underground network to be signalled using mechanical semaphore signals . Although disused , the illuminated track diagram in the signal box continued to show the progress of trains until its closure . The Epping to Ongar branch was not heavily used and became increasingly unprofitable . The service was further undermined when the Greater London Council removed the running subsidy for the line because it was not within the boundaries of Greater London , and no comparable subsidy was forthcoming from the local government agencies in Essex , which meant that fare levels were much higher than on the rest of the London Underground network . Initially , the Sunday service was dropped , and then the Saturday service . Subsequently , the service was restricted to a rush hour service only of just 7 trains in each direction per day ( 3 in the morning and 4 in the evening ) . The Epping to Ongar line , including North Weald station , was finally closed on 30 September 1994 . The station and the line are now in the ownership of a private company who , at time of purchase , publicly stated their intentions to run commuter services once again : to date this stated ambition has been thwarted by the absence of available platform space at the Epping end of the line and the fierce objections from residents for proposals for a third platform beyond the road bridge to the North of the station . The current owners are the Epping Ongar Railway , a heritage railway company who run heritage trains on Sundays over most of the line , stopping short of Epping .

776 Berbericia is a minor planet orbiting the Sun . A main-belt asteroid , it was discovered by A. Massinger at Heidelberg on January 24 , 1914 . It was named in honor of Adolf Berberich ( 1861-1920 ) , a German astronomer . In the late 1990s , a network of astronomers worldwide gathered lightcurve data that was ultimately used to derive the spin states and shape models of 10 new asteroids , including ( 776 ) Berbericia . Richard P. Binzel and Schelte Bus further added to the knowledge about this asteroid in a lightwave survey published in 2003 . This project was known as Small Main-belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey , Phase II or SMASSII , which built on a previous survey of the main-belt asteroids . The visible-wavelength ( 0.435-0 .925 micrometre ) spectra data was gathered between August 1993 and March 1999 .
For discussion how dietary fats affect cardiovascular health , see Diet and heart disease . In biochemistry and nutrition , monounsaturated fats or MUFA ( MonoUnsaturated Fatty Acid ) are fatty acids that have a single double bond in the fatty acid chain and all of the remainder of the carbon atoms in the chain are single-bonded . By contrast , polyunsaturated fatty acids have more than one double bond . Fatty acids are long-chained molecules having a methyl group at one end and a carboxylic acid group at the other end . Fatty acid viscosity ( thickness ) and melting temperature increases with decreasing number of double bonds . Therefore , monounsaturated fatty acids have a higher melting point than polyunsaturated fatty acids ( more double bonds ) and a lower melting point than saturated fatty acids ( no double bonds ) . Monounsaturated fatty acids are liquids at room temperature and semisolid or solid when refrigerated . Common monounsaturated fatty acids are palmitoleic acid ( 16:1 n 7 ) , cis-vaccenic acid ( 18:1 n 7 ) and oleic acid ( 18:1 n 9 ) . Palmitoleic acid has 16 carbon atoms with the first double bond occurring 7 carbon atoms away from the methyl group ( and 9 carbons from the carboxyl end ) . It can be lengthened to the 18-carbon cis-vaccenic acid . Oleic acid has 18 carbon atoms with the first double bond occurring 9 carbon atoms away from the carboxylic acid group . The illustrations below show a molecule of oleic acid in Lewis formula and as a space-filling model . Although polyunsaturated fats protect against cardiovascular disease by providing more membrane fluidity than monounsaturated fats , they are more vulnerable to lipid peroxidation ( rancidity ) . On the other hand , some monounsaturated fatty acids ( in the same way as saturated fats ) promote insulin resistance , whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids are protective against insulin resistance . In contrast to this , the large scale KANWU study found that neither dietary monounsaturated or supplemented polyunsaturated fats ( in the form of fish oil ) affected insulin sensitivity while increased consumption of saturated fat significantly decreased insulin sensitivity . Foods containing monounsaturated fats reduce low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol , while possibly increasing high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol . However , their true ability to raise HDL is still in debate . Levels of oleic and monounsaturated fatty acids in red blood cell membranes were positively associated with breast cancer risk . The saturation index ( SI ) of the same membranes was inversely associated with breast cancer risk . Monounsaturated fats and low SI in erythrocyte membranes are predictors of postmenopausal breast cancer . Both of these variables depend on the activity of the enzyme 9-d delta 9 desaturase . In children , consumption of monounsaturated oils is associated with healthier serum lipid profiles . Monounsaturated fats are found along with saturated fat in natural foods such as red meat , whole milk products , nuts and high fat fruits such as olives and avocados . Olive oil is about 75 % monounsaturated fat while tea seed oil is commonly over 80 % monounsaturated fat . Canola oil and Cashews are both about 58 % monounsaturated fat . Tallow ( beef fat ) is about 50 % monounsaturated fat and lard is about 40 % monounsaturated fat . Other sources include macadamia nut oil , grapeseed oil , groundnut oil ( peanut oil ) , sesame oil , corn oil , popcorn , whole grain wheat , cereal , oatmeal , safflower oil , sunflower oil , tea-oil Camellia , and avocado oil .

Walking Trees : Teaching Teachers in New York City Schools is a book by Ralph Fletcher . It was first published in 1990 . It was published again in 1995 under a slightly different title Walking Trees : Portraits of Teachers and Children in the Culture of Schools . Walking Trees : Teaching Teachers in New York City Schools is the story of Ralph Fletcher 's introduction to the New York City school system as a teacher trainer in a writing staff development program . Brenda Miller Power in her review for Educational Leadership said `` Walking Trees is a wonder '' , she believes that Fletcher has `` done a superb job of cataloging in specific ways the difference between a burned-out teacher and a bad teacher '' and that `` it 's greatest contribution to our field may be that it helps us begin to ask more of the right kinds of difficult questions '' . Nancy E. Zuwiyya in her review for Library Journal said that `` Fletcher 's early encounters often prove frustrating , and his description of a typical uncooperative teacher as a `` snarling lump of inertia '' will make educators uncomfortable . At the end , Fletcher reveals that not only have the students and teachers learned but he two has acquired a wisdom that he lacked in the beginning . '' Curriculum Review said that this book was `` a funny , hopeful , angry , but most importantly , beautifully written book chronicling one teacher 's first year instructing New York City teachers how to teach writing . ''

Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo SDB , GCL ( born February 3 , 1948 ) is a Roman Catholic bishop who received , together with JosÃ Ramos-Horta , the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize , for their work `` towards a just and peaceful solution to the conflict in East Timor . '' The fifth child of Domingos Vaz Filipe and Ermelinda Baptista Filipe , Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo was born in the village of Wailakama , near Vemasse , on the north coast of East Timor . His father , a schoolteacher , died two years later . His childhood years were spent in Catholic schools at Baucau and Ossu , before he proceeded to the Dare minor seminary , outside Dili , from which he graduated in 1968 . From 1969 until 1981 , apart from periods of practical training ( 1974 â `` 1976 ) back in East Timor and in Macau , he was in Portugal and Rome where , having become a member of the Salesian Society , he studied philosophy and theology before being ordained a priest in 1980 . Returning to East Timor in July 1981 he became a teacher for 20 months , then Director for two months , at the Salesian College at Fatumaca . On the resignation of Martinho da Costa Lopes in 1983 , Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo was appointed Apostolic Administrator of the Dili diocese , becoming head of the East Timor church and directly responsible to the Pope . In 1988 , he was consecrated a Bishop ( of Lorium , Italy ) . Father Belo was the choice of the Vatican 's Pro Nuncio in Jakarta and the Indonesian leaders because of his supposed submissiveness , but he was not the choice of the Timorese priests who did not attend his inauguration . However within only five months of his assuming office he protested vehemently , in a sermon in the cathedral , against the brutalities of the Kraras massacre ( 1983 ) and condemned the many Indonesian arrests . The church was the only institution capable of communicating with the outside world , so with this in mind the new Apostolic Administrator started writing letters and building up overseas contacts , in spite of the isolation arising from the opposition of the Indonesians and the disinterest of most of the world . In February 1989 he wrote to the President of Portugal , the Pope , and the UN Secretary-General , calling for a UN referendum on the future of East Timor and for international help for the East Timorese , who were `` dying as a people and a nation '' , but when the UN letter became public in April , he became even more of a target of the Indonesians . This precariousness increased when Bishop Belo gave sanctuary in his own home , as he did on various occasions , to youths escaping the Santa Cruz massacre ( 1991 ) , and endeavored to expose the numbers of victims killed . Bishop Belo 's courageous labors on behalf of the East Timorese and in pursuit of peace and reconciliation were internationally recognized when , along with JosÃ Ramos-Horta , he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in December 1996 . Bishop Belo capitalized upon this honor through meetings with Bill Clinton of the United States and Nelson Mandela of South Africa . Belo has also been awarded the John Humphrey Freedom Award . In the aftermath of East Timorese independence on 20 May 2002 , the pressure of events and the ongoing stress he endured began to show their effects on Bishop Belo 's health . Pope John Paul II accepted his resignation as Apostolic Administrator of Dili on November 26 , 2002 . Following his resignation Bishop Belo traveled to Portugal for medical treatment . By the beginning of 2004 , there were repeated calls for him to return to East Timor and to run for the office of president . However , in May 2004 he told Portuguese state-run television RTP , that he would not allow his name to be put up for nomination . `` I have decided to leave politics to politicians , '' he stated . One month later , on June 7 , 2004 , PascuÃ l Chavez , rector major of the Salesian Society , announced from Rome that Bishop Belo , returned to health , would take up a new assignment . In agreement with the Holy See , he would go to Mozambique as a missionary , and live as a member of the Salesian Society in that country . In a statement released on June 8 , Bishop Belo explained : `` Following two meetings in 2003 and in 2004 with His Eminence the Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples , I am offering myself to serve the Kingdom of God on the Missions , outside East Timor , in Mozambique , more precisely in the Diocese of Maputo . To go on the missions was a dream that I always had during the years of my youth . Also during the 19 years of my episcopal ministry in Dili ( 1983-2002 ) , one of the subjects I spoke about most was that of the missions and the need to be missionaries . Today has come the time to put into practice what I said to the Christians of East Timor . '' In July 2004 , Bishop Belo took up missionary work in Maputo , the capital of Mozambique . In February 2011 , the Bishop received the Prize for Lusophonic Personality of the Year , given by in the Lisbon Academy of Sciences .
The footballer described the South American animal as `` my slightly more hairy brother ! '' Mineiro redirects here ; for the Brazilian footballer nicknamed Mineiro , see Mineiro ( Footballer ) . Mineiro feminine : Mineira ) , also called Brazilian mountain dialect , is the Brazilian Portuguese term for the inhabitants of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais and also the characteristic accent spoken in the heart of that state , and also in its capital , Belo Horizonte . This dialect is quite complicated , due the pronunciation of the words , which is fast and curled . There are times that , when other Brazilians , who speak other dialects , do not understand what the mineiros speak . Minas Gerais was settled during the late 17th and early 18th centuries by a mix of recent Portuguese immigrants ( reinÃ is or `` emboabas '' ) and earlier colonists that came from SÃ # o Paulo ( paulistas ) . There was an intense rivalry between the two groups , fighting over the gold mines ( from which the name of the province was taken , Minas Gerais means `` General Mines '' ) . These conflicts required the intervention of the Portuguese Crown after a serious uprisal developed into civil war ( Guerra dos Emboabas ) with the final defeat of the `` paulistas '' in 1708 . See the article `` Guerra dos Emboabas '' in the Portuguese language Wikipedia . In the 19th century , the state was being forgotten due the decline of gold mining . Due to this isolation , the state was influenced by the dialect of Rio de Janeiro in the southeast , while the south and the `` Triangulo Mineiro '' region , began to speak the rustic dialect of Sao Paulo ( caipira ) . The central region of Minas Gerais , however , developed their own dialect , which is known as Mineiro or mountain dialect . This dialect is also present in cities of the center and southest of the state , which is surrounded by mountains and mines .

Prospecting is the physical search for minerals , fossils , precious metals or mineral specimens , and is also known as fossicking . Prospecting is a small-scale form of mineral exploration which is an organised , large scale effort undertaken by mineral resource companies to find commercially viable ore deposits . Prospecting is physical labor , involving traversing ( traditionally on foot or on horseback ) , panning , sifting and outcrop investigation , looking for signs of mineralisation . A prospector must also make claims , meaning they must erect posts with the appropriate placards on all four corners of a desired land they wish to prospect and register this claim before they may take samples . The traditional methods of prospecting involved combing through the countryside , often through creek beds and along ridgelines and hilltops , often on hands and knees looking for signs of mineralisation in the outcrop . In the case of gold , all streams in an area would be panned at the appropriate trap sites looking for a show of ` color ' or gold in the tail . Once a small occurrence or show was found , it was then necessary to intensively work the area with pick and shovel , and often via the addition of some simple machinery such as a sluice box , races and winnows , to work the loose soil and rock looking for the appropriate materials ( in this case , gold ) . For most base metal shows , the rock would have been mined by hand and crushed on site , the ore separated from the gangue by hand . Often , these shows were short-lived , exhausted and abandoned quite soon , requiring the prospector to move onwards to the next and hopefully bigger and better show . Occasionally , though , the prospector would strike it rich and be joined by other prospectors and larger-scale mining would take place . Although these are referred thought of as `` old '' prospecting methods , these techniques are still used today but usually coupled with more advanced techniques such as magnetic surveying and gravimetric analysis . In most countries in the 19th and early 20th century , it was very unlikely that a prospector would retire rich even if he was the one who found the greatest of lodes . For instance Patrick ( Paddy ) Hannan , who discovered the Golden Mile , Kalgoorlie , died without receiving anywhere near a fraction of the value of the gold contained in the lodes , the same story repeated at Bendigo , Ballarat , Klondike and California . In the United States and Canada prospectors were lured by the promise of gold , silver , and other precious metals . They traveled across the mountains of the American West , carrying picks , shovels and gold pans . The majority of early prospectors had no training and relied mainly on luck to discover deposits . Other gold rushes occurred in Papua New Guinea , Australia at least four times , and in South Africa and South America . In all cases , the gold rush was sparked by idle prospecting for gold and minerals which , when the prospector was successful , generated ` gold fever ' and saw a wave of prospectors comb the countryside . Modern prospectors today rely on training , the study of geology , and prospecting technology . Knowledge of previous prospecting in an area helps in determining location of new prospective areas . Prospecting includes geological mapping , rock assay analysis , and sometimes the intuition of the prospector . Metal detectors are invaluable for gold prospectors , as they are quite effective at detecting gold nuggets within the soil down to perhaps 3 feet , depending on the acuity of the operator 's hearing and skill . Magnetic separators may be useful in separating the magnetic fraction of a heavy mineral sand from the nonmagnetic fraction , which may assist in the panning or sieving of gold from the soil or stream .

Lubanki , also known as Labanki , is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by the Labanas tribal grouping in Punjab . It is classified as a form or dialect of Punjabi . Lubanki has been spoken in Rajasthan and Gujrat areas and some areas of Pakistan . The Punjabi word tanda is allegedly of Lubanki origin and means a town . The dialect is almost extinct . With the loss of language prestige and status , most Labanas now speak other forms of Panjabi as their primary language . When Guru Tegh Bahadur Was discovered by Baba Makhan Shah Labana , Makhan Shah climbed on top a village roof and started shouting the famous line `` Guru ladho rae , '' `` The Guru has been found , '' which is alleged to be in Lubanki dialect .
Verbenaceae , commonly known as the verbena family or vervain vamily , is a family of mainly tropical flowering plants . It contains trees , shrubs and herbs notable for heads , spikes , or clusters of small flowers , many of which have an aromatic smell . Recent phylogenetic studies have shown that numerous genera traditionally classified in Verbenaceae belong instead in Lamiaceae . The new narrowly circumscribed Verbenaceae family includes some 35 genera and 1,200 species . The mangrove genus Avicennia , sometimes placed in Verbenaceae or in its own family , Avicenniaceae , has rather confidently been placed in Acanthaceae .
Tux is a penguin character and the official mascot of the Linux kernel . Originally created as an entry to a Linux logo competition , Tux is the most commonly used icon for Linux , although different Linux distributions depict Tux in various styles . In video games featuring the character , female counter parts , named Penny and Gown , accompany him . The character is used in many other Linux programs and as a general symbol of Linux . The concept of the Linux mascot being a penguin came from Linus Torvalds , the creator of Linux . Tux was created by Larry Ewing in 1996 after an initial suggestion made by Alan Cox and further refined by Linus Torvalds on the Linux kernel mailing list . Torvalds took his inspiration from a photograph he found on an FTP site , showing a penguin figurine looking strangely like the Creature Comforts characters made by Nick Park . The first person to call the penguin `` Tux '' was James Hughes , who said that it stood for '' ( T ) orvalds ( U ) ni ( X ) '' . However , tux is also an abbreviation of tuxedo , the outfit which springs to mind when one sees a penguin . Tux was originally designed as a submission for a Linux logo contest . Three such competitions took place ; Tux won none of them . This is why Tux is formally known as the Linux mascot and not the logo . Tux was created by Larry Ewing using the first publicly released version ( 0.54 ) of GIMP , a free software graphics package . It was released by him under the following condition : According to Jeff Ayers , Linus Torvalds had a `` fixation for flightless , fat waterfowl '' and Torvalds claims to have contracted `` penguinitis '' after being gently nibbled by a penguin : `` Penguinitis makes you stay awake at nights just thinking about penguins and feeling great love towards them . '' Torvalds ' supposed illness is a joke , but he really was bitten by a Little Penguin on a visit to the National Zoo & Aquarium , Canberra , Australia . Torvalds was looking for something fun and sympathetic to associate with Linux , and a slightly fat penguin sitting down after having had a great meal perfectly fit the bill . In some Linux distributions , Tux greets the user during booting , with multi-processor systems displaying multiple images of Tux , one for each processor-core . Tux appeared as a character during one arc in the webcomic User Friendly . TUX is the name of a Linux-based web server . In 1999 , Corel Linux Deluxe included a free Linux Penguin ( Tux ) . Tux has taken on a role in the Linux community similar to that which Mario holds in the Nintendo community . He has been featured in open-source look-alikes of other mainstream games , such as Tux Racer , Extreme Tux Racer , Tux Math Scrabble , TuxWordSmith Tux Math , SuperTux , Super Tux Kart , and Tux Paint . As such , several computer games , mostly free and open source and\/or for Linux , have starred Tux , including : Some games that star Tux also include explicitly female penguin characters , allowing the players to play as one of those characters instead of Tux . One such female penguin is Tux 's friend `` Gown '' . Gown is variously depicted as being a pink version of Tux ( XTux ) or as having a somewhat less fat appearance and wearing items of clothing such as a red and white short skirt and a hair bow ( e.g. TuxKart and A Quest for Herring ) . In SuperTux and SuperTuxKart , there is a different female penguin called `` Penny '' who is purple and white ( SuperTuxKart once had Gown and still has a map called `` Gown 's Bow '' ) . In the upcoming Tux 2 there is supposed to be a female penguin called `` Trixi '' , and in FreeCiv the female leader name for the Antarctican civilization is `` Tuxette '' . friends . \/ Tuz was the mascot of the 2009 linux . conf . au conference . It has been chosen by Linus Torvalds as the logo for version 2.6.29 of the Linux kernel to support the effort to save the Tasmanian devil species from extinction due to the Devil facial tumor disease .

Musica ficta ( from Latin , ` false ' , ` feigned ' , or ` contrived ' music ) was a term used in European music theory from the late 12th century to about 1600 to describe any pitches , whether notated or to be added by performers in accordance with their training , that lie outside the system of musica recta or musica vera ( ` correct ' or ` true ' music ) as defined by the hexachord system of Guido of Arezzo . In modern usage , the term is often loosely applied to all unnotated inflections ( whether properly recta or ficta ) that must be inferred from the musical context and added either by an editor or by the performers themselves ( Bent and Silbiger 2001 ) . One common ( though not exclusive ) use of ficta was to avoid harsh harmonic or melodic intervals such as the tritone , for example the use of a E instead of a E to avoid dissonance with a B in another part . In modern transcriptions of medieval and Renaissance music , ficta are usually indicated by an `` accidental '' sign appearing above the note . ( In modern notation , accidentals are written before the note , not above . ) Editors provide these ficta for modern singers , whereas the kind of training given to singers of that time may have made such indications unnecessary . Medieval and Renaissance singers were trained in a system of hexachords , six-note scales in which each note was given a name - in ascending order : ut-re-mi-fa-sol-la . A hexachord contained only one half-step interval , between mi and fa . The 11th century theorist Guido of Arezzo had designated three types of hexachord : molle ( `` soft '' ) starting on F , with a half-step between A ( mi ) and Bâ ( fa ) ; naturale starting on C , with a half-step between E ( mi ) and F ( fa ) ; and durum ( `` hard '' ) starting on G , with a half-step between B ( mi ) and C ( fa ) . The ficta hexachords were those having a note other than A , E , or B as `` mi '' . For example , a raised F ( in modern terms , F-sharp ) , indicated by adding the sign , created a ficta hexachord starting on D ( D E Fâ G A B ) that would be operative until that part mutated into another hexachord where the raised F was no longer desired . Likewise a sign applied to any note other than B would indicate that it was `` fa '' in a ficta hexachord ; or , when applied to B , that the hexachord was molle rather than durum . Unfortunately , the use of the signs was by no means consistent : it was assumed that a good singer `` knew his mi 's and fa 's , '' so that the signs were typically only added if the scribe anticipated that singers would be likely to interpret differently otherwise . The exact performance practice of musica ficta - where and when they were used - is a matter of intense investigation and controversy among musicologists and is likely to remain so for a long time to come . Music theorists from Odo of Cluny in the 10th century to Zarlino in the 16th gave highly different rules and situations for the application of ficta . Thus the controversy is not only among contemporary musicologists ; theorists of the Late Middle Ages were never in agreement on the rules of ficta either . Johannes de Garlandia ( 13th century ) and Philippe de Vitry ( 14th century ) both wrote that ficta were essential in singing polyphony because of the necessity of forestalling certain dissonances and properly arranging cadences ; but they resisted their use in plainchant . The early 14th century theorist Jacques de LiÃ ge , on the other hand , insisted that notes in plainchant needed to be altered with judicious application of musica ficta . ! Contrapuntal treatises of the Renaissance , such as Johannes Tinctoris 's Liber de arte contrapuncti ( 1477 ) and Gioseffe Zarlino 's Le istituzioni harmonice ( 1588 ) , described resolution at cadences through a major sixth into the octave or the inversion , a minor third closing to a unison , which , unless the other voice already descends by a semitone , necessitates the rising voice to add a sharp ( see dyadic counterpoint ) ( Tinctoris 1961 , ; Zarlino 1968 , 144 â `` 45 ) . At such points , accidentals were in fact sometimes notated throughout this period of history .
Parvicursor ( meaning `` small runner '' ) is a genus of tiny maniraptoran dinosaur with long slender legs for fast running . At only about 39 cm ( ~ 15 in ) from snout to end of tail , and 162 grams ( 5.7 ounces ) in weight , it is one of the smallest non-avian dinosaurs known from an adult specimen . Like other members of the family Alvarezsauridae , the forelimbs of Parvicursor were short and stubby , with hands all but completely reduced to a single large claw , possibly useful for opening tough termite mounds or other types of digging . It is unlikely that the claw could have served much for defense , as it was short and not adapted for flexible movements -- it is more likely it would do as the animal 's name implies : cursor means runner . Parvicursor is known from Late Cretaceous Campanian sediments at Khulsan , Mongolia . The type species , P. remotus , is only known from one incomplete specimen , mostly pelvis and hind legs . Close relatives include Shuvuuia and Mononykus , and together with these it is classified in the alvarezsaurid subfamily Alvarezsauridae . There may be a second , yet-unnamed , species of Parvicursor . Two specimens of tiny alvarezsaurids were described by Suzuki et al . in 2002 . These authors considered the specimens to be juvenile Shuvuuia , which lived in the same formation . However , a study by Nick Longrich and Phil Currie in 2009 suggested that several characters of the skeleton , including fused wrist and pelvic bones , indicated that these specimens were in fact adults of a tiny alvarezsaurid species . A phylogenetic analysis found that they grouped together with Parvicursor , and the authors provisionally referred them to Parvicursor sp . pending further study .

Stev is one of the poetic forms that can be found in lyric poetry from Scandinavia . The English version of the word is stave , meaning the stressed syllable in a metric verse . Of the gamlestev that have been preserved , most of them are from Setesdal and Ã vre Telemark . This poetic form is equivalent to the metre of the medieval ballad , and is used over most of Northern Europe : Oh who will shoe my bonny foot and who will glove my hand and who will lace my middle waist with a long , long linen band . The metre in most old staves is free , and the rhyming is always on the second and fourth line . Some gamlestev might be remnants of folk songs that have been split up , and thereby losing completeness . In Telemark , nystev have been replaced by rural folksongs , to a great extent . By contrast , nystev in Setesdal have held much of their ground . Many folksongs are based on the form , which rhymes in pairs : Den dag kjem aldri at eg deg glÃ ymer for nÃ r eg sÃ ver , eg om deg drÃ ymer . og natt og dag er du like nÃ r , men best eg ser deg nÃ r myrkt det er . A person who can perform a stev , is known as a kveder ( or `` kvedar '' ) , in Norwegian ( a folk-singer ) . A kveder from Setesdal , when performing stev , generally sings more slowly , than a kveder from Telemark . One reason for this , may be that Setesdal stev are often more meditative ( or elegiac ) , in regard to the stev text . Stev consists of stanzas , that have four lines .

JosÃ Luis AragonÃ s SuÃ rez ( ; born July 28 , 1938 ) , usually referred to as Luis AragonÃ s and sometimes simply as Luis , is a former Spanish footballer and national coach . AragonÃ s has spent the majority of his career as a player and coach at AtlÃ tico Madrid . He was a prominent player and then coach of the successful AtlÃ tico team of the late 1960s and early 1970s . The team won La Liga four times , reached the final of the European Cup and won the Intercontinental Cup . Between 1964 and 1974 he played 265 La Liga games for AtlÃ tico and scored 123 goals . AragonÃ s has coached the club on four separate occasions . He has also played with several other clubs , most notably Real Betis , and played 11 times for Spain , scoring three goals . Apart from AtlÃ tico he has also coached seven other La Liga clubs as well as the Spanish national football team whom he led to their 2nd European Championship title in 2008 . He became the head coach of the Turkish football team FenerbahÃ e after Euro 2008 , and this is the first time that AragonÃ s has coached outside of his native Spain . AragonÃ s began his playing career with CD Getafe in 1957 and that was also where he picked up his nickname `` the elf '' . In 1958 he signed for Real Madrid but never made it into the senior team . He spent most of his time at Real Madrid on loan to other clubs , including Recreativo de Huelva and HÃ rcules CF and Ã beda CF and playing for AD Plus Ultra , the Real Madrid reserve team . In 1960 he joined Real Oviedo and made his debut in the Primera Division . Between 1961 and 1964 he played for Real Betis , making 86 league appearances and scoring 33 goals . He was part of the team champion of Euro 1964 , being reserve in the quarterfinals against Ireland . While at AtlÃ tico , AragonÃ s acquired the nickname Zapatones , meaning big boots and he was known as a free kick specialist . He was a regular goalscorer and in 1970 he shared the Pichichi with his fellow AtlÃ tico forward JosÃ Eulogio GÃ rate and Amancio . In 1974 he scored in the 1 â `` 1 draw with Bayern Munich as AtlÃ tico held the German team in the European Cup final before losing 4 â `` 0 in the replay . After retiring as a player AragonÃ s was appointed AtlÃ tico coach for the first time in 1974 . He soon earned himself a new nickname , El Sabio de Hortaleza ( The Wise Man from Hortaleza ) . But after Aragones started going to the gym he changed it to the `` Ogre '' because of his appearance and maximum trained muscles . At the 2006 FIFA World Cup , Spain won all three group games before facing France in the Second Round . After taking the lead through David Villa , they lost 3 â `` 1 following goals from Franck RibÃ ry , Patrick Vieira and Zinedine Zidane . At Euro 2008 , Spain also won all three group games , beat 2006 World Cup champion Italy on penalty kicks in the quarterfinals , beat Russia 3 â `` 0 in the semifinal , and in the final defeated Germany 1 â `` 0 through a Fernando Torres goal , giving AragonÃ s his first trophy as Spain 's manager , and the first for the country in 44 years . AragonÃ s , apparently a superstitious person , made known his dislike for Spain 's away kit which they had to wear during the crucial semifinal match against Russia . He insisted that the jerseys were `` mustard '' and not `` yellow '' . In 2004 AragonÃ s was appointed coach of Spain . During a training session in the same year , a Spanish TV crew filmed AragonÃ s trying to motivate JosÃ Antonio Reyes by making offensive references about Reyes ' Arsenal F.C. black team-mate , Thierry Henry , saying : The incident caused uproar in the British media with calls for AragonÃ s to be sacked . After an investigation into the events during the match , UEFA fined the RFEF 100,000 Swiss francs\/87 ,000 USD ( one day 's wages ) and warned that any future incidents would be punished more severely . UEFA noted that possible punishments could include suspension from major international tournaments or the closure of Spain 's home international matches to supporters . In response to this , Aragones has said in public that he is not a racist , and claimed that he had black friends.Brazilian-born black midfielder Marcos Senna stated : He later took a swipe at England 's colonial past in the build up to a match between the two national teams in November 2004 which was also overshadowed by racist abuse aimed at colored English players . Palpably , the absence of strict measures against any of the aforementioned incidents contributed to the fury of English media and the football players alike and further dented Aragones 's image in England .
Marco Tardelli ( born 24 September 1954 ) is a former football player from Italy , and is the current assistant manager for the Republic of Ireland . He played defensive midfielder with Juventus and the Italian national team . He was part of the Italian side to win the 1982 World Cup and was five time Italian Serie A champion . He was well known for his battling qualities , primarily his stamina and mental toughness as well as his ruthless tackling . He was also known for his technical abilities and his ability to score vital goals . Tardelli was born at Capanne di Careggine , in the province of Lucca ( Tuscany ) . He started his career in the Italian Serie C with the club of Pisa . Two years later he played in the Serie B with Como before joining Serie A giants Juventus in October 1975 . During his decade-long stint at the Turin club , he won all the three major European competitions : the UEFA Cup , Cup Winners ' Cup and European Cup as well as five times the Italian Serie A championship and three Coppa Italia ( Italian Cup ) . He scored the decisive goal during the first leg of the UEFA Cup finale against Athletic Bilbao , allowing Juventus to gain this competition in 1977 , his first and also the first European title for Juventus . Tardelli played 376 games with Juventus and scored 51 goals . His fierce nature on the pitch famously attracted the quote `` He 's responsible for more scar tissue than the surgeons at Harefield Hospital '' from the Tottenham Hotspur and England center forward Jimmy Greaves . Tardelli made his international debut on 7 April 1976 against Portugal . He played at the 1978 World Cup and the 1980 European Football Championship . He performed especially well during Italy 's 1982 World Cup-winning campaign , scoring twice . His first came in a group stage match against Argentina and the second in the final against West Germany . He is particularly remembered for his famous goal celebration in the final . With tears in his eyes , he sprinted towards the Italian bench , fists clenched in front of his chest , screaming `` Goal ! Goal ! '' as he shook his head wildly . This celebration would become known as the `` Tardelli cry '' . He won a total of 81 caps for Italy , playing his final game for them against Norway in September 1985 . He retired as a player in 1988 . Tardelli started his managing career as head coach of the Under 16 Italian national team in 1988 , immediately after his retirement . Two years later , he became the assistant coach of Cesare Maldini for the Under 21 team . In 1993 he switched to Como of Serie C1 .

Hanna Lake is a lake near Quetta city in Pakistan and is one of the main attractions in the city and a reservoir was Constructed by the British Empire . In 1894 , a small action dam Surrpull ( Red Bridge ) was constructed on main Urak road for converting of water into Hanna Lake coming from the Zarghoon Mountains range , of streams , snow melting and rains through main channel . This channel nowadays needs repairs and is wasting water and recently the water level is deadly low , up to three feet , and thousands of fish are in danger . There is also a water channel which was constructed the same time by the British to convert the snow and rain water near spin kaarez coming from Murdar mount to surrpull for filling of water in this lake . This channel was destroyed by the heavy flood in 1976 and still not constructed and all the snow and rain water is going waste till now and resultant the Hanna Lake was fully dried in 1999 to January 2005 . If Hanna Lake Development Authority ( HLDA ) the custodians of Hanna Lake did not perform any action to bring water through surrpull the lake will be soon dry again . The lake is located a little short of the place where the Urak Valley begins and 14 km from Quetta . The beautiful Hanna Lake was built in the time of British Empire in 1894 . Golden fish in the lake come swimming right up to the edge of the lake . There is a lakeside restaurant with picnic tables shaded by pine trees . At one end , the irrigation dam rises out of the depths like battlements of a fort , and on the eastern part the well known Hayat Durrani Water Sports Academy ( HDWSA ) the only rowing , canoeing , kayaking and sailing training center in Balochistan Province . Hanna Lake is very attractive for holidaymakers , and is crowded with hikers and campers in holidays . You can hire a boat and paddle on the lake and round the island in the middle . The HLDA \/ HDWSA and Merck has planted various trees for the beautification and protection of environment in Hanna Lake Mountains . The turquoise waters of the lake provide a rich contrast to the sandy brown of the hills in the background . One can promenade on the terraces or hire a boat and paddle on the lake and round the island in the middle . Public wagon service operates from city bus station side by the City District Government office . The transport can also be hired through the PTDC Tourist Information Center , Muslim Hotel , Jinnah Road Quetta .
Flagellates are organisms with one or more whip-like organelles called flagella . Some cells in animals may be flagellate , for instance the spermatozoa of most phyla . Flowering plants do not produce flagellate cells , but ferns , mosses , green algae , some gymnosperms and other closely related plants do . Likewise , most fungi do not produce cells with flagellae , but the primitive fungal chytrids do . Many protists take the form of single-celled flagellates . The word flagellate describe a particular construction of eukaryotic organism and its means of motion . The term does not imply any specific relationship or classification of the organisms that possess flagellae . However , the term `` flagellate '' is included in other terms ( such as `` dinoflagellate '' and `` zooflagellate '' ) which often are more formally characterized . Eukaryotic flagella are supported by microtubules in a characteristic arrangement , with nine fused pairs surrounding two central singlets . These arise from a basal body or kinetosome , with microtubule roots that are an important part of the cell 's brain . In some , for instance , they support a cytostome or mouth , where food is ingested . The flagella often supports hairs , called mastigonemes , or contain rods . Their ultrastructure plays an important role in classifying eukaryotes . In protoctists and microscopic animals , flagella are generally used for propulsion . They may also be used to create a current that brings in food . In most things , one or more flagella are located at or near the anterior of the cell e.g. Euglena . Often there is one directed forwards and one trailing behind . Among animals , fungi , and Choanozoa , which make up a group called the opisthokonts , there is a single posterior flagellum . They are from the phylum Mastigophora . They can cause diseases and they can make their own food .

The pilum ( plural pila ) was a javelin commonly used by the Roman army in ancient times . It was generally about two metres long overall , consisting of an iron ( or , rather , `` soft '' steel ) shank about 7 mm in diameter and 60 cm long with pyramidal head . The shank was joined to the wooded shaft by either a socket or a flat tang . The total weight of a pilum was between two and five kilograms , with the versions produced during the Empire being a bit lighter than those dating from the previous Republican era . The iron shank was the key to the function of the pilum . The weapon had a hard barbed tip but the shank itself was not properly tempered . This deliberate ` un-tempering ' would cause the shank to bend after impact , thus rendering the weapon useless to the enemy . More importantly , If the pilum struck the shield of an enemy it would embed itself into the shield 's fabric , and this along with the bending of the shank would cause the shield to become unwieldy , forcing the enemy to discard it . Pila were divided into two models : heavy and light . Pictorial evidence suggests that some versions of the weapon were weighted by a lead ball to increase penetrative power but archeological specimens of this design variant are not so far known . Recent experiments have shown pila to have a range of approximately 30 m , although the effective range is up to 15 - . Legionaries of the Late Republic and Early Empire often carried two pila , with one sometimes being lighter than the other . Standard tactics called for Roman soldiers to throw one of them ( both if time permitted ) at the enemy , just before charging to engage with the gladius . The effect of the pila throw was to disrupt the enemy formation by attrition and by causing gaps to appear in its protective shield wall . Pila could also be used in hand-to-hand combat ; one documented instance of this occurred at the Siege of Alesia . Additionally , pila could be employed as a thrusting implement and a barrier against cavalry charges . Some pila had small hand-guards , to protect the wielder if he intended to use it as a melee weapon , but it does not appear that this was common . As to the missile weapons of the infantry , they were javelins headed with a triangular sharp iron , eleven inches ( 279 mm ) or a foot long , and were called piles . When once fixed in the shield it was impossible to draw them out , and when thrown with force and skill , they penetrated the cuirass without difficulty . They had likewise two other javelins , the largest of which was composed of a staff five feet and a half long and a triangular head of iron nine inches ( 229 mm ) long . This was formerly called the pilum , but now it is known by the name of spiculum . The soldiers were particularly exercised in the use of this weapon , because when thrown with force and skill it often penetrated the shields of the foot and the cuirasses of the horse . It may be argued that a short iron shaft has very few confirmations from archeology . Vegetius is writing about a one foot iron shaft because at Vegetius ' time the pilum had disappeared and been substituted by similar shorter weapons such as the plumbatae or the above mentioned spiculum . Thanks in part to experimental archaeology , it is generally believed that the pilum 's design evolved to be armour-piercing : the pyramidal head would punch a small hole through an enemy shield allowing the thin shank to pass through and penetrate a distance sufficient to hit the man behind it . The thick wooden shaft provided the weight behind the punch . In one description , one of the two iron nails that held the iron shaft in place was replaced with a weak wooden pin that would break on impact causing the shaft to twist sideways . Gaius Marius is sometimes given credit for this modification . It has been argued that later pila were constructed so that the iron shank would bend on impact . Having penetrated a shield through a small hole and its shank having bent , such a pilum would now be more difficult to remove , and , of course , impossible to throw back . Further complications and injury could ensue if the understandably-reluctant enemy did not discard his precious shield quickly enough , as there would be a great press from the men behind him . Opinion among archaeologists once held that the main function of the shank was to disable both shields and the pila itself by bending , but it is now thought that the pilum was a form of `` personal artillery '' designed simply to provide a massive counter-shock against any charging foe , and , as necessary , turn any legionary into a spearman .

Liturgy is either the customary public worship done by a specific religious group , according to its particular traditions ( corresponding to ritual ) or a more precise term that distinguishes between those religious groups that believe their ritual requires the `` people '' to do the `` work '' of responding to the priest , and those that do not ( hence leitourgia = work of the people ) . The word , sometimes rendered by its English translation `` service '' , may refer to an elaborate formal ritual such as the Eastern Orthodox Divine Liturgy and Catholic Mass , or a daily activity such as the Muslim salat and Jewish services . As a religious phenomenon , liturgy is a communal response to the sacred through activity reflecting praise , thanksgiving , supplication , or repentance . Ritualization may be associated with life events such as birth , coming of age , marriage and death . It thus forms the basis for establishing a relationship with a divine agency , as well as with other participants in the liturgy . Methods of dress , preparation of food , application of cosmetics or other hygienic practices are all considered liturgical activities . The familiar sense of the word is an extension of the technical term in ancient Greek , leitourgia , signifying the often expensive offers of service to the people , and thus to the polis and the state . Through the leitourgia the rich carried a financial burden and were correspondingly rewarded with honors . The leitourgia became both mandatory and honorific , supporting the patron 's standing among the elite . The holder of a Hellenic leitourgia was not taxed a specific sum , but entrusted with a particular ritual , which could be performed with greater or lesser magnificence . The chief sphere remained that of civic religion , embodied in the festivals : M.I. Finley notes `` in Demosthenes ' day there were at least 97 liturgical appointments in Athens for the festivals , rising to 118 in a ( quadrennial ) Panathenaic year . '' Eventually , under the Roman Empire , such obligations , known as munera , devolved into a competitive and ruinously expensive burden that was avoided when possible . Main article : Christian liturgy . Frequently in Christianity a distinction is made between `` liturgical '' and `` non-liturgical '' churches based on the elaboration and\/or antiquity of the worship , but this obscures the universality of public worship as a religious phenomenon . Thus , even the open or waiting worship of Quakers is liturgical , since the waiting itself until the Holy Spirit moves individuals to speak is a prescribed form of Quaker worship , sometimes referred to as `` the liturgy of silence . '' Typically in Christianity , however , the term `` the liturgy '' normally refers to a standardized order of events observed during a religious service , be it a sacramental service or a service of public prayer . In the Catholic tradition , liturgy is considered to mean the participation of the people in the work of God and in the liturgy Jesus Christ is considered to continue the work of redemption in union with his Church .

The Blue-Throated Hummingbird , Lampornis clemenciae , is a species of hummingbird , a member of the Trochilidae family of birds . The Blue-throated Hummingbird is a fairly large hummingbird , reaching 11.5 to 12.5 cm ( 4 Â 1\/2 to 5 inches ) in length and 6 to 10 grams in weight . The Blue-throated Hummingbird is dull green on the top of its body , fading to medium gray on its belly . It has a conspicuous white stripe behind its eye and a narrower stripe extending backward from the corner of its bill , bordering a blackish cheek patch . Its tail feathers are iridescent blue-black with broad white tips on the outer two to three pairs . The species gets its name from the adult male 's iridescent blue throat patch ( gorget ) , but the female lacks this , having a plain gray throat . Males sing two types of songs : a simple `` peep song , '' which sounds like a squeaky wheel , and a quiet but complex `` whisper song . '' The female is also reported to sing during the breeding season to attract the attention of males . The Blue-throated Hummingbird is native to mountain woodlands of Mexico , although during the summer it is an uncommon to rare resident of moist , wooded canyons in the Madrean sky islands of southeastern Arizona , southern New Mexico , and western Texas in the United States and northeastern Sonora , Mexico . A few individuals traditionally winter at feeding stations in southeastern Arizona . The male takes no part in nest building or care of the young . The female constructs her nest from soft plant fibers , held together and attached to its support ( a tree branch , flowering plant , fern , vine , rock shelf , or manmade object such as a wire or nail ) using strands of spider silk stolen from spider webs . The exterior is camouflaged with green mosses where available ; in drier habitats , mosslike dendroid lichens may be used , or the exterior may be left bare . Blue-throated Hummingbirds frequently nest over water , especially flowing streams . The two white eggs hatch in 17 to 19 days , and the young leave the nest at 24 to 26 days of age . Up to three broods per year are possible under ideal conditions ; the female usually builds each new nest atop the previous nest , leading to nest `` towers '' at traditional nest sites . Like other hummingbirds , the Blue-throated Hummingbird feeds on nectar from flowers and catches insects in flight and by gleaning from vegetation . In winter , sap from wells drilled by sapsuckers may substitute for nectar .
Orthosie ( or ; Greek = Î Ï Î Ï Ï Î Î ) , also known as ' , is a natural satellite of Jupiter . It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2001 , and given the temporary designation ' . Orthosie is about 2 kilometres in diameter , and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 20,568 Mm in 602.619 days , at an inclination of 142 Â to the ecliptic ( 143 Â to Jupiter 's equator ) , in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.2433 . It was named in August 2003 after Orthosie , the Greek goddess of prosperity and one of the Horae . The Horae ( Hours ) were daughters of Zeus and Themis . Orthosie belongs to the Ananke group , retrograde irregular moons which orbit Jupiter between 19.3 and 22.7 Gm , at inclinations of roughly 150 Â .
The Central Powers ( German : MittelmÃ chte ; Hungarian : KÃ zponti hatalmak ; Turkish : Ä ttifak Devletleri or BaÄ laÅ ma Devletleri ; Bulgarian : Ð Ð Ð 1\/2 Ñ Ñ Ð Ð '' Ð 1\/2 Ð Ñ Ð Ð '' Ð ) was one of the two sides that participated in World War I and was also known as the Triple Alliance , the other being the Triple Entente ( Allied Powers ) . It was made up of the German Empire , the Austro-Hungarian Empire , the Ottoman Empire , and the Kingdom of Bulgaria . The Central Powers consisted of the German Empire , the Austro-Hungarian Empire , the Ottoman Empire , and the Kingdom of Bulgaria . The name `` Central Powers '' is derived from the location of these countries ; all four were located between the Russian Empire in the east and France and the United Kingdom in the west . On 7 October 1879 , Germany and Austria-Hungary became allies and formed the Dual Alliance . On 20 May 1882 , they were joined by the Kingdom of Italy in what was known as the Triple Alliance . This alliance was intended to be limited to defensive purposes only . When World War I began , the petition made by Germany and Austria-Hungary for Italian intervention was rejected by the Italian Government on the grounds of these two countries declaring war on the Kingdom of Serbia , rather than taking defensive action against it . Italy eventually entered World War I on May 23 , 1915 , but it fought against Germany and Austria-Hungary rather than with them , because of the land promised them in the Treaty of London made with France and Britain . This treaty promised Italy the Italian-speaking lands of Austria-Hungary and territories in Asia Minor , Africa and the Balkans . Following the outbreak of war in Europe during August 1914 , the Ottoman Empire intervened at the end of October by taking action against Russia , resulting in declarations of war by the Triple Entente . Bulgaria , still resentful after its defeat in July 1913 at the hands of Serbia , Greece , Romania and the Ottoman Empire , was the last nation to enter the war against the Allies , invading Serbia in conjunction with German and Austro-Hungarian forces in October 1915 . Other movements supported the efforts of the Central Powers for their own reasons , such as the Irish Nationalists who launched the Easter Rising in Dublin in April 1916 ; they referred to their `` gallant allies in Europe '' . In 1914 JÃ zef PiÅ sudski was permitted by the Rebel Alliance to form independent Polish legions . PiÅ sudski wanted his legions to help the Central Powers defeat Russia and then side with France and the UK and win the war with them . During the years 1917 and 1918 , the Finns under C.G.E. Mannerheim and the Ukrainian and Lithuanian nationalists fought Russia for a common cause . The Ottoman Empire also had its own allies in Azerbaijan and the Northern Caucasus . The three nations fought alongside each other under the Army of Islam in the Battle of Baku . Bulgaria signed an armistice with the Allies on 29 September 1918 , following a successful Allied advance in Macedonia . The Ottoman Empire followed suit on 30 October 1918 in the face of British and Arab gains in Palestine and Syria . Austria and Hungary concluded ceasefires separately during the first week of November following the disintegration of the Habsburg Empire and the Italian offensive at Vittorio Veneto ; Germany signed the armistice ending the war on the morning of 11 November 1918 after the Hundred Days Offensive , and a succession of advances by New Zealand , Australian , Canadian , Belgian , British , French and US forces in north-eastern France and Belgium . There was no unified treaty ending the war ; the Central Powers were dealt with in separate treaties .
A tricolor or tricolor ( three colors ) is a flag or banner more-or-less equally divided ( horizontally , vertically , or , less frequently , diagonally ) into three bands of differing colors . The term is somewhat misleading , as many tricolors have more than three colors , as they are often charged with contrasting emblems ( the flag of India as a prominent example ) . Besides carrying an emblem , another means by which a tricolor may have more than three colors is through the use of fimbriation : the separation of colors on a flag by a narrow contrasting stripe . In a fimbriated tricolor , the three broad bands are separated by two thin stripes on either side of the central band . Flags of this type include the flags of Uzbekistan , Kenya , North Korea , and Gambia . One of the first tricolors and the oldest tricolor still in use today is the flag of the Netherlands ; one of the first vertical tricolors is the tricolore of France . The tricolor is a specific type of triband . In a triband , the design is of three vertical , horizontal , or diagonal stripes , often formedâ '' from an heraldic point of viewâ '' by the placement of a vertical or horizontal stripe ( a pale or a fess , respectively ) , over a background . The triband may thus have two stripes of the same color split by a stripe of a second color ( examples of this include the flags of Austria , Canada , and Spain ) . In a tricolor , the two outer stripes are of different colors . They can thus be seen as a subset of tribands . Vexillologists also occasionally describe flags of which the main element is three stripes as being `` based on a tricolor ( or triband ) design '' . Flags such as the flag of the Bahamas and the Palestinian flag fall into this category . Some vexillologists take the meaning of the term at its barest , and simply use it to describe any flag containing just three colors , irrespective of the design . Thus , the flags of the United States and the United Kingdom might be described as tricolors , while the flag of India ( which has a blue charge in the center ) would not .

Carnosauria is a group of large predatory dinosaurs that lived during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods . While it originally contained a wide assortment of giant theropods that were not closely related , the group has since been defined to encompass only the allosaurs and their closest kin . Recently , scientists have discovered some very large carnosaurs in the carcharodontosaurid family such as Giganotosaurus and Tyrannotitan which are among the largest known predatory dinosaurs . Distinctive characteristics of carnosaurs include large eyes , a long narrow skull and modifications of the legs and pelvis such as the thigh ( femur ) being longer than the shin ( tibia ) . Modern cladistic analysis defines Carnosauria as those tetanurans sharing a more recent common ancestor with Allosaurus than with modern birds . Carnosauria has traditionally been used as a dumping ground for all large theropods , but analysis in the 1980s and 1990s revealed that other than size , the group shared very few characteristics , making it polyphyletic . Most former carnosaurs were reclassified as more primitive theropods . Others were placed in Coelurosauria if they were more closely related to birds , like the tyrannosaurids . Other former carnosaurs include the megalosaurids , the spinosaurids , and the ceratosaurs . Even non-dinosaurs have been considered carnosaurs , such as the rauisuchian Teratosaurus . `` Carnosaurus '' is an informal generic name , attributed to Friedrich von Huene , 1929 , that is sometimes seen in lists of dinosaurs . It is probably a typographical error ; von Huene intended to assign indeterminate remains to Carnosauria incertae sedis , but at some point in the process of publication , the text was revised to make it appear that he was creating a new generic name `` Carnosaurus '' ( as described by George Olshevsky in a 1999 post to the Dinosaur Mailing List ) .
The Settlers II : Veni , Vidi , Vici ( original German title : Die Siedler II : Veni , Vidi , Vici ) is a real-time strategy computer game , released by Blue Byte Software in 1996 . Its gameplay is very similar to that of its predecessor , The Settlers , albeit with a Roman theme and improved graphics . It is the second game in The Settlers series . Many fans of the franchise consider this the best game of the Settlers series , primarily because future installments changed the transport management aspect considerably . This popularity more recently boosted Blue Byte 's decision to publish a remake of the game , The Settlers II 10th Anniversary for Windows and Nintendo DS port . Settlers II can be played in either campaign mode or through individual scenarios defined by the user . The user can also engage in a split screen match with a human opponent on the same computer with a second mouse . The player 's main objectives are building a diverse economy and conquering every computer opponent . The player begins each map with a warehouse and a set amount of materials and tools . The economy is driven by serfs who transport goods through a network of roads and also populate a building once its completed , if the necessary tool to perform the building task is present in the warehouse . The economy is based on gathering raw materials which include food , rock , lumber , and ores . The player has control over what percent of a materials is transported to each building for processing . All raw materials are used to enable different economic functions such as food enables miners to mine , rock and lumber are used as material to construct buildings and other tasks while different ores are used to construct tools and war material . The player has a limited territory ( area of land ) upon which he can construct buildings and roads . During the start of the game , the main warehouse is the main building granting territory around a specific radius . Territory can be expanded by creating one of four military complexes ( Barracks , Guardhouse , Watchtower and Fortress ) near the present territory border . Each complex must have at least one soldier garrisoned to receive the added territory bonus . Soldiers can be created by manufacturing a sword and shield , and using them to upgrade a serf . One `` unit '' of beer is also required to upgrade a serf to a soldier . Gold coins can also be added to raise the rank of a soldier making him stronger in combat . The player can send any amount of available soldiers to an enemy military complex where the soldier ( s ) must defeat all enemy soldiers housed in the building . If the player 's units defeats all housed soldiers then the military complex is taken over by the player with the accompanying territory of the buildings radius . The catapult can only attack an enemy 's military buildings , such as Fortress , Watch tower , Guard house , or Barracks . As long as stones are supplied , the catapult will fire automatically . The probablility of a successful attack is about two thirds . The player wins the scenarios once he defeats all opponents by occupying all their military complexes including the main warehouse or , in campaign mode , when he gains control of a specific area of the map that allows access to the next level . At this point , the game gives an option to either quit the game or continue playing even when all opponents have been destroyed .
Prana is the Sanskrit for `` vital life '' ( from the root ' `` to fill '' , cognate to Latin plenus `` full '' ) . It is one of the five organs of vitality or sensation , viz . prana `` breath '' , vac `` speech '' , chakshus `` sight '' , shrotra `` hearing '' , and manas `` thought '' ( nose , mouth , eyes , ears and mind ; ChUp . In Vedantic philosophy , prana is the notion of a vital , life-sustaining force of living beings and vital energy , comparable to the Chinese notion of Qi . Prana is a central concept in Ayurveda and Yoga where it is believed to flow through a network of fine subtle channels called nadis . Its most subtle material form is the breath , but it is also to be found in the blood , and its most concentrated form is semen in men and vaginal fluid in women . The Pranamaya-kosha is one of the five Koshas or `` sheaths '' of the Atman . Prana was first expounded in the Upanishads , where it is part of the worldly , physical realm , sustaining the body and the mother of thought and thus also of the mind . Prana suffuses all living forms but is not itself the Atman or individual soul . In the Ayurveda , the Sun and sunshine are held to be a source of Prana . In Yoga , the three main channels of prana are the Ida , the Pingala and the Sushumna . Ida relates to the right side of the brain , and the left side of the body , terminating at the left nostril and pingala to the left side of the brain and the right side of the body , terminating at the right nostril . In some practices , alternate nostril breathing balances the prana that flows within the body . In most ancient texts , the total number of nadis in the human body is stated to be 72,000 . When prana enters a period of uplifted , intensified activity , the Yogic tradition refers to it as Pranotthana . In Ayurveda , the PrÄ á a is further classified into subcategories , referred to as prana vayus . According to Hindu philosophy these are the vital principles of basic energy and subtle faculties of an individual that sustain physiological processes . There are five pranas or vital currents in the Hindu system : Pranayama is the practice in which the control of prana is achieved ( initially ) from the control of one 's breathing . According to Yogic philosophy the breath , or air , is merely a gateway to the world of prana and its manifestation in the body . In yoga , pranayama techniques are used to control the movement of these vital energies within the body , which is said to lead to an increase in vitality in the practitioner . However , intensive practice of these techniques is not trivial . Kason describes situations where intensive pranayama techniques may have adverse effects on certain practitioners .

JosÃ Manuel Ochotorena Santacruz ( born 16 January 1961 in San SebastiÃ n , Gipuzkoa ) is a retired Spanish footballer who played as a goalkeeper . Ochotorena emerged through Real Madrid 's youth ranks , making his professional debuts late in 1981 â `` 82 , due to a professional 's strike , as he was still part of the reserve squad setup . He would have to wait until 1985 â `` 86 to become a starter , helping the capital side to the season 's La Liga and UEFA Cup titles , but lost his spot the following season , after the signing of Sevilla FC 's Francisco Buyo . After that , Ochotorena moved to Valencia CF , winning the Ricardo Zamora Trophy in his first season , being replaced mere minutes into the last game , at Real Madrid , which helped him maintain his average . After three solid seasons at Estadio Mestalla , he was sent off in a game against Real Madrid , and never appeared officially for the Che again . Ochotorena retired in 1996 , after unassuming spells with CD Tenerife , CD LogroÃ Ã s ( he played most of the games in 1994 â `` 95 , but the Riojan were relegated ) and Racing de Santander . He earned one cap for Spain on September 20 , 1989 , taking over for Andoni Zubizarreta for the final ten minutes in a friendly with Poland , in A CoruÃ a , and was in the final squad for the 1990 FIFA World Cup . Ochotorena then assumed goalkeeping coach duties at both Valencia and the national team but , when countryman Rafael BenÃ tez joined English Premier League team Liverpool in July 2004 , he replaced Joe Corrigan . In July 2007 , he returned to Valencia once again , replaced at Liverpool by Xavi Valero .
A nazim ( , from the Arabic word for `` organizer '' or `` convenor '' ) ( similar to mayor ) is the coordinator of cities and towns in Pakistan . Nazim is the title in Urdu of the chief elected official of a local government in Pakistan , such as a district , tehsil , union council , or village council . The name which is used for the president of Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba , the Islamic Union of Students in Pakistan , is Nazim-e-ala . The nazim-e-ala is elected for one year , and after completing that tenure , all the members of IJT who are called ( Arkaan ) elect a new one . The `` chief nazim , '' or district nazim , is elected by the nazims of Union Councils , Union Councillors , and Tehsil Nazims , who themselves are elected directly by the votes of the local public . Pakistan originally had a system inherited from the time of British rule , in which a Mayor was the head of a district . Under the Local Government Act , however , the role of the nazim became distinct from that of a Mayor , with more power . The nazim system was introduced after the commissionerate system , imposed during British rule , was lifted by the government of Pakistan . Now there is no commissioner for any of the divisions , deputy commissioner for the districts , or assistant commissioners , since the Local Government act was imposed in the country in 2001 . The one exception is Islamabad , the federal capital , where the commissionerate system remains in effect . In 2009 , the new government restored the commissionerate system in the divisions but the nazims also remain in power .
Vasily Grigorevich Zaytsev ( , ; March 23 , 1915 â `` December 15 , 1991 ) was a Soviet sniper during World War II , notable particularly for his activities between November 10 and December 17 , 1942 during the Battle of Stalingrad . He killed 225 soldiers and officers of the Wehrmacht and other Axis armies , including 11 enemy snipers . Prior to November 10 , he had already killed 32 Axis soldiers with the standard-issue Mosin-Nagant rifle . Between October 1942 and January 1943 , Zaytsev made 242 verified kills . Zaytsev was born in Yeleninskoye and grew up in the Ural Mountains , where he learned marksmanship by hunting deer with his grandfather and younger brother . When he was 12 years old , he killed his first wolf . His surname is based on the Russian word zayats ( Ð Ð Ñ Ñ ) meaning `` hare '' . Vasily served in the Soviet Navy as a clerk in Vladivostok . When Nazi forces invaded the Soviet Union , Zaitsev , like many of his comrades , volunteered to be transferred to the frontline . At the time he had already reached the rank of Sergeant Major . On 22 September 1942 , Zaytsev crossed the Volga River and joined the 1047th Rifle Regiment of the 284th Rifle Division of the 62nd Army , headed by General Nikolai Batyuk . One day , Zaytsevâ s commanding officer called him up and pointed at an enemy officer in a window 800 meters away . Vasily took aim from his standard-issue Mosin-Nagant rifle , and with one shot , the officer was down . In less than a few moments , two other Nazi soldiers appeared in the window , checking their fallen officer . Vasily fired two more shots , and they were killed . For this , together with the Medal for Valor , Vasily was also awarded a sniper rifle . He is notable for having been elevated to a virtual status of hero via the use of propaganda and served as an example and inspiration to other soldiers . There , his skill as a sniper allowed him to establish a snipers ' training school in the Metiz factory ; it was run by Zaytsev . Zaytsev trained apprentices were nicknamed zaichata , meaning `` leverets '' ( baby hares ) . Antony Beevor wrote in Stalingrad that this was the start of the `` sniper movement '' in the 62nd Army . Conferences were arranged to spread the doctrine of `` sniperism '' and exchange ideas on technique and principles that were not limited to marksmanship skills . It is estimated that the snipers Zaytsev trained killed more than 6000 enemy soldiers during World War II . During Zaytsev 's career as a sniper , he would hide in all sorts of locations â `` on high ground , under rubble , in water pipes . After a few kills he would change his position . Together with his partner Nikolay Kulikov , Zaitsev would hide and sting . One of Zaitsevâ s common tactics was to cover one large area from three positions with two men at each point â `` a sniper and scout . This tactic , known as the â sixes , â is still in use today and was implemented during the war in Chechnya . Zaytsev took part in the battle for Stalingrad until January 1943 , when he suffered an injury to his eyes from a mortar attack . He was attended to by Professor Filatov , who is credited with restoring his sight . On February 22 , 1943 Zaytsev was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union . He then returned to the front and finished the war in Seelow Heights in Germany with the military rank of Captain . After the war , Zaytsev managed a factory in Kiev , and remained in that city until he died in 1991 at the age of 76 , just 10 days before the final collapse of the Soviet Union . On January 31 , 2006 , Vasily Zaytsev was reburied on Mamayev Kurgan with full military honors . Zaytsev 's dying wish was to be buried at the monument to the defenders of Stalingrad . His coffin was carried next to a monument where his famous quote is written : `` For us there was no land beyond ( the ) Volga . '' Colonel Donald Paquette of the US Sniper School was present , and laid a wreath as a sign of respect to a legendary sniper . US Army News quoted Colonel Paquette : `` Vasily Zaytsev is a legend and every USA sniper must memorize his tactics and methods . He is a legend in the sniper community . May he rest in peace . '' In 2001 , a feature length film , Enemy at the Gates , starring Jude Law as Zaytsev , was loosely based on the Battle of Stalingrad , most notably displaying a fictional ongoing rivalry with a Wehrmacht sniper school director , Major Erwin KÃ nig . Although Zaytsev really took part in the Battle of Stalingrad , the movie was mostly a work of fiction . Zaytsev himself indicates that a three-day duel did indeed occur in his own memoirs and that the sniper he killed was the head of a sniper school near Berlin . However , there is no evidence that any Major Erwin KÃ nig ever existed , despite the claim made by the Armed Forces Museum of Moscow that they are in possession of his telescopic sight .

Minute Maid is a product line of beverages , usually associated with lemonade or orange juice , but now extends to soft drinks of many kinds , including Hi-C . Minute Maid is sold under Cappy brand in Central Europe and under Fruitopia in Germany . Minute Maid was the first company to market orange juice concentrate , allowing it to be distributed throughout the United States and served year-round . The Minute Maid company is owned by The Coca-Cola Company , and is the world 's largest marketer of fruit juices and drinks . The firm opened its headquarters in Sugar Land Town Square in Sugar Land , Texas , United States , on February 16 , 2009 ; previously it was headquartered in the 2000 St. James Place building in Houston . In 2002 the Houston Astros baseball team sold the naming rights for their venue , subsequently named Minute Maid Park , and the company now owns 8.5 % of the team . The company was originally incorporated in 1945 as Florida Foods , Inc. . It employs over 1,900 people and has over $ 2 billion in sales ( 1997 est . ) . In 1945 , the National Research Corporation ( NRC ) of Boston , Massachusetts , developed a method of concentrating orange juice into a powder using a high-vacuum evaporation process previously developed for dehydrating medical products for use in the U.S. war effort . The US Army had a need for 500,000 lb ( 227,000 kg ) for the war , so NRC created a new branch , the Florida Foods Corporation . Led by John M. Fox , the company won the government contract for $ 750,000 . The war ended and the contract was canceled before the factory could be built , but with investment , the company moved forward with a product . Rather than selling powder to the public market , the company decided to create frozen orange juice concentrate , using a process that eliminated 80 percent of the water in orange juice . A Boston marketing firm came up with the name Minute Maid , implying the juice was quick and easy to prepare . First shipment took place in April 1946 . The same month , the company is renamed Vacuum Foods Corporation . With limited funds for advertising , Fox himself went door to door giving free samples , until demand skyrocketed . The ability to purchase fresh-tasting orange juice at any time of year , far from where oranges are grown , proved popular , and led to the company 's national success . Additionally , Bing Crosby was made their first pitchman in 1949 who was the worlds biggest star by that time being in movies , radio , records and soon TV . At the time , the IRS taxed the stars 77 % on their income but this deal circumvented it as a capital gains tax . In October 1949 the company adopted the name Minute Maid Corp. . The Minute Maid company was purchased by Coca-Cola in 1960 . In 1967 , Minute Maid relocated to Houston , Texas , and is joined with Duncan Foods to form the Coca-Cola Foods division . In 1970 , the company was involved in a scandal in the United States about bad housing , often referred to as `` slave quarters , '' and working conditions of Minute Maid farm laborers in Florida . The United Farm Workers stepped in to support the workers . NBC reported on the issue in a 1970 documentary called Chet Huntley 's Migrant : An NBC White Paper . In response to the bad press and a boycott in Florida , the company established a program that improved the workers ' situation . In 1973 , the company released its first ready-to-drink , chilled orange juice product in the United States , entering an `` orange juice war '' with Tropicana . In 1996 , the name was changed from Minute Maid Corp. to The Minute Maid Company . The Coca-Cola Company sold its Minute Maid orange groves in Florida in 1997 . The United Farm Workers again took the side of the orange growers during this time . In 2001 , the Minute Maid division of Coca-Cola launched the Simply Orange brand . In 2002 , Minute Maid bought the naming rights to re-brand the Houston Astros ballpark from Enron Field to Minute Maid Park . In 2003 , Minute Maid 's division fully merges with Coca-Cola North America . In Costa Rica Minute Maid sells Hi-C products . However , the entry of Minute Maid is seen by many as late as a lot of beverages companies are already there and the market is not really growing . Thus , Minute Market has a lot of competition to deal with . Minute Maid has its headquarters in an office building in the Sugar Land Town Square development in First Colony , Sugar Land , Texas . In 1985 , The Coca-Cola Company purchased the 2000 St. James Place in Houston from Bechtel Corporation for Minute Maid . Minute Maid moved in to the new office building the following year . In 2007 , Coca-Cola retained New York-based Corporate Realty Consultants and Boyd Commercial LLC of Houston to sell 2000 St. James Place . The company negotiated with Planned Community Developers to lease an office building in Sugar Land Town Square . Then , in January 2008 , Minute Maid announced plans to move its headquarters to Sugar Land . The headquarters building is located at Sugar Land 's town center and opened on February 16 , 2009 . The city of Sugar Land gave the company a $ 2.4 million tax incentive to move its headquarters there .
Year 16 ( XVI ) was a leap year starting on Wednesday ( link will display the full calendar ) of the Julian calendar . At the time , it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Taurus and Libo ( or , less frequently , year 769 Ab urbe condita ) . The denomination 16 for this year has been used since the early medieval period , when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years .

Pax Romana ( Latin for `` Roman peace '' ) was the long period of relative peace and minimal expansion by military force experienced by the Roman Empire in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD . Since it was established by Caesar Augustus it is sometimes called Pax Augusta . Its span was about 207 years ( 27 BC to 180 AD ) . The concept of Pax Romana was first described by Edward Gibbon in The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , in Chapter II . Gibbon proposed a period of moderation under Augustus and his successors and argued that generals bent on expansion ( e.g. Germanicus , Agricola and Corbulo ) were checked and recalled by the Emperors during their victories favoring consolidation ahead of further expansion . Gibbon lists the Roman conquest of Britain under Claudius and the conquests of Trajan as exceptions to this policy of moderation and places the end of the period at the death of Marcus Aurelius in 180 AD , despite the conclusion of peace by the latter 's son Commodus later in the same year . During the Pax Romana , the area of Roman rule expanded to about five million square kilometres ( two million square miles ) . Pax Romana , according to Gibbon , would have ended with Commodus himself , whose dispendious excesses and despotic misrule destabilised central Roman politics amidst the chaos of the Germanic invasions of the Rhine-Danube frontier . Commodus 's assassination led to a succession crisis , the so-called Year of the Five Emperors , which culminated in the ascension of a soldier-emperor , Septimius Severus , who , despite giving the Empire a peaceful reign , was accused by Gibbon of catalysing the Crisis of the Third Century , a period of economic , political and military crisis that , together with the Germanic invasions and the rise of the Sassanid Persian Empire in the East , almost led the Empire to collapse . Lacking a good precedent of successful one-man rule , Augustus created a junta of the greatest military magnates and stood as the front man . By binding together these leading magnates in a coalition , he eliminated the prospect of civil war . The Pax Romana was not immediate , despite the end of the civil wars , because fighting continued in Spain and in the Alps . Nevertheless , Augustus twice closed the Gates of Janus ( the Roman ceremony to mark world Peace ) , first in 29 BC and again in 25 BC . At the time of the Ludi Saeculares in 17 BC the concept of Peace was publicized , and in 13 BC was proclaimed when Augustus and Agrippa jointly returned from pacifying the provinces . The Ara Pacis ceremony was no doubt part of this announcement . Augustus faced a problem making peace an acceptable mode of life for the Romans , who had been at war with one power or another continuously for 200 years . Romans regarded peace not as an absence of war , but the rare situation that existed when all opponents had been beaten down and lost the ability to resist . Augustus ' challenge was to persuade Romans that the prosperity they could achieve in the absence of warfare was better for the Empire than the potential wealth and honor acquired when fighting a risky war . Augustus succeeded by means of skillful propaganda . Subsequent emperors followed his lead , sometimes producing lavish ceremonies to close the Gates of Janus , issuing coins with Pax on the reverse , and patronizing literature extolling the benefits of the Pax Romana . Given the prominence of the concept of Pax Romana , historians have coined variants of the term to describe systems of relative peace that have been established , attempted or argued to have existed . Such times have been credited to the British Empire during the 19th century . Some variants include :
These include novels , stage plays , films , television shows , animated works , manga , and video games . The pebibyte is a standards-based binary multiple ( prefix pebi , symbol Pi ) of the byte , a unit of digital information storage . The pebibyte unit symbol is PiB .

Biochemistry is the chemistry of life . Biochemists study the elements , compounds and chemical reactions that are controlled by biomolecules ( such as polypeptides , polynucleotides , polysaccharides , lipids and chemical messengers ) and take place in all living organisms .
Polar moment of inertia is a quantity used to predict an object 's ability to resist torsion , in objects ( or segments of objects ) with an invariant circular cross section and no significant warping or out-of-plane deformation . It is used to calculate the angular displacement of an object subjected to a torque . It is analogous to the area moment of inertia , which characterizes an object 's ability to resist bending and is required to calculate displacement . The larger the polar moment of inertia , the less the beam will twist , when subjected to a given torque . Polar moment of inertia should not be confused with moment of inertia , which characterizes an object 's angular acceleration due to a torque . See moment ( physics ) . The polar moment of inertia can not be used to analyze shafts with non-circular cross-sections . In such cases , the torsion constant can be substituted instead . In objects with significant cross-sectional variation ( along the axis of the applied torque ) , which can not be analyzed in segments , a more complex approach may have to be used . See 3-D elasticity . However the polar moment of inertia can be used to calculate the moment of inertia of an object with arbitrary cross-section . The SI unit for polar moment of inertia , like the area moment of inertia , is metre to the fourth power ( m4 ) . The polar moment of inertia appears in the formulae that describe torsional stress and angular displacement . where is the torque , is the distance from the center and is the polar moment of inertia . Most frequently the inverse problem is solved , in which one solves for the radius . The angular frequency is therefore 314.16 rad\/s and the torque 3.1831 x 106 NÂ m. The radius is 0.200 m. If one adds a factor of safety of 5 and re-calculates the radius with the maximal stress equal to the yield stress\/5 the result is a radius of 0.343 m , or a diameter of 69 cm , the approximate size of a turboset shaft in a nuclear power plant .
Chase & Status are an electronic production duo from London consisting of Saul `` Chase '' Milton and Will `` Status '' Kennard . Chase & Status have had three number one tracks on the UK Dance Chart in 2007 with the double A-side `` Hurt You '' \/ `` Sell Me Your Soul '' , and in 2008 with `` Take Me Away '' \/ `` Judgement ( Informer ) '' . On 5 October 2008 , they reached number 70 on the national singles chart and number one on the UK Dance Chart again with their single `` Pieces '' featuring vocals by Plan B. In 2009 , they made number 45 with `` Against All Odds '' which featured UK rapper Kano . Chase & Status ' first album , More Than Alot , debuted in the UK album charts at number 49 on 19 October 2008 and entered the UK dance album chart at number 2 . Their album More Than Alot received the Best Album Award at the 2009 Drum and Bass awards , Birmingham , UK . Following the success of their last album the band wanted to gain a more global success . After meeting with a long time favorite of theirs , Cloud9 , they decided to move in a different direction . Together they agreed that the band should do more pop collaborations in order to achieve a more mainstream fanbase . Soon afterwards they quickly began working on the album . On 8 November 2009 , the duo entered the UK Top 40 for the first time with the track `` End Credits '' . The track was released on 2 November 2009 and featuring British musician Plan B managed to reach a peak of number 9 on the UK Singles Chart . The single was written for the movie Harry Brown , which also starred Ben Drew , aka . Plan B. The duo then released `` Let You Go '' on 15 August 2010 , revealing it to be the second official single to be released from their second studio album , named No More Idols according to posters outside their album launch show at the HMV Forum in Kentish Town on October 21 . The single featured vocals from Mali and debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 11 ; marking the duo 's second consecutive Top 40 hit . `` Hypest Hype '' featuring Tempa T was confirmed in October 2010 to be the third single from the album and was released as a free download from their website on 8 November 2010 ; meaning it did not qualify to chart . The fourth single from the album is the dubstep-flavoured Blind Faith , which features Nottingham-born soul singer\/songwriter Liam Bailey was released on January 24 , 2011 . The new anticipated album also contains a new single ` Heavy ' with Dizzee Rascal . The album debuted at number 2 in the UK and was certified Gold in the first week of sales by the BPI .

I , II , and III Meqabyan ( Ge ` ez : á á á á `` á , sometimes spelled Makabian ) are three books in the Ethiopian Orthodox Old Testament Biblical canon . Although these books are completely different in content from the books of Maccabees in Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Bibles , they are sometimes referred to as Ethiopic Maccabees or Ethiopian Maccabees . The `` Maccabees '' described in these books are not those of the Hasmonean dynasty , and the `` Five Holy Maccabean Martyrs '' here do not correspond to the martyred `` Woman with seven sons '' , who were also referred to as `` Maccabees '' and are revered throughout Orthodoxy as the `` Holy Maccabean Martyrs '' . These three books long existed only in Ethiopic , but have recently been translated into standard English by Feqade Selassie . The historical Maccabees are referred to again in Chapter 15 , which describes the three brothers Judas , Meqabis ( Simon Maccabaeus ) and Mebikyas ( Jonathan Maccabee ) as leading a successful revolt against the evil king Akrandis of Midian , who was oppressing Israel . Here , Mebikyas enters Akrandis ' camp and decapitates him at his dinnertable , food still in his mouth , while Judas and Meqabis defeat the king 's armies in the field .

On both occasions he featured twice each in games of West Germany , making also two appearances for the West Germans in their runner-up campaign at the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico . In total he played in 37 caps until 1989 . His former Hamburg team-mate Felix Magath appointed Rolff as assistant at Hamburger SV in 1997 . In 1998 Rolff took sole charge of SV Meppen for six months until the clubs relegation from the 2nd Bundesliga . He went on working as assistant to his former Karlsruhe manager Winfried SchÃ fer at VfB Stuttgart and was , shortly after , named caretaker manager of Die Schwaben . In 2000-2001 he worked in the coaching staff of former Germany coach Berti Vogts during Vogts ' reign as manager of Bayer 04 Leverkusen , also one of Rolff 's ex-clubs . Subsequent to Vogts ' departure from Leverkusen in 2001 , Rolff worked as assistant to Vogts after Vogts had been hired to guide Kuwait . Rolff did not follow Vogts to Scotland , indeed , and was in July 2004 employed by SV Werder Bremen as assistant manager .
See KÄ Å ikÄ vá ttÄ `` for the medieval grammarians . Vamana ( Devanagari : à à 3\/4 à à , IAST : VÄ mana ) is described in the Puranic texts of Hinduism as the Fifth Avatara of Vishnu , and the first incarnation of the Second Age , or the Treta yuga . Also he is the first Avatar of Vishnu which appears with a completely human form , though it was that of a dwarf brahmin . He is also sometimes known as Upendra . Vamana was born to Aditi and Kashyapa . He is the twelfth of the Adityas . Vamana is held to be the younger brother of Indra . The legend of Bhagavata has it that the Vamana avatar was taken by Vishnu to restore Indra 's authority over the heavens , which was taken away by force by the demon king Bali in Dravida . Bali was the grandson of Prahlada , the son of Hiranyakshipu . Vamana , in the guise of a short Brahman , carried a wooden umbrella and requested three steps of land for him to live in . Given a promise of three steps of land by King Mahabali against the warning given by his Guru Sukracharya , Vamana , The Supreme God grows so huge that he could step from heaven to earth , and earth to the lower worlds in two simple steps . King Mahabali unable to fulfil the promise of three paces of land to the Supreme God , offers his head for the third step . Thus Vamana places his foot on King Mahabali 's head and gives him immortality for his benevolence . Vamana taught King Mahabali that arrogance and pride should be abandoned if any advancement in life is to be made , and that wealth should never be taken for granted since it can so easily be taken away . Vamana then took on the form of Mahavishnu and was pleased by King Mahabali 's determination and ability to keep his promise , despite his spiritual master 's curse and the prospect of losing all his wealth . Vishnu named the King Mahabali since he was a Mahatma ( great soul ) . He allowed Mahabali to return to the spiritual sky to associate with Prahalada ( the demoniac Hiranyakashipu 's pious son ) and other divine beings . Mahavishnu also declared that Mahabali would be able to rule the universe in the following yuga ( age ) . Mahabali was the grandson of Prahlada , being the son of Prahlada 's son Virochana who was killed in a battle with the Devas . Mahabali is supposed to return every year to the land of his people , to ensure that they are prosperous . Vamana is discussed in the Guru Granth Sahib , the sacred text of Sikhism . : Satjugi tai manio Chalio bali bavan bhaio : In Satyayuga , you sported as the dwarf incarnation , and fooled Bali . On page 1330 of the Guru Granth Sahib , Vamana is mentioned as the `` enticer '' of Baliraja . According to the Adhyatma Ramayana It is also said that Vamanadeva is the guard of the gate of Bali Maharaja 's planet Sutala and will remain so forever . Tulsidas ' Ramayana too declares that Vamana became the `` dwarpal '' ( gate-defender ) of Bali . It is said that Mahabali attained Moksha by atmanivedinam . Krishna in the Sri RÅ `` pa GosvÄ mÄ `` s Bhakti-ras Ä mrta-sindhuh says that Mahabali came to Him or attained Him . Some traditions also hold that Vamana was an avatar of Ganesha .
Thelxinoe ( , or as in Greek Î Î Î '' Î 3\/4 Î Î 1\/2 Ï Î ) , also known as ' , is a natural satellite of Jupiter . It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2004 from pictures taken in 2003 , and originally received the temporary designation ' . Thelxinoe is about 2 kilometres in diameter , and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 20,454 m in 597.607 days , at an inclination of 151 Â to the ecliptic ( 153 Â to Jupiter 's equator ) , in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.2685 . It was named in March 2005 after Thelxinoe , one of the four original Muses according to some Greek writers , and a daughter of Zeus ( Jupiter ) by Mnemosyne . Thelxinoe belongs to the Ananke group , retrograde irregular moons which orbit Jupiter between 19.3 and 22.7 Gm , at inclinations of roughly 150 Â .
John Robin Warren AC ( born 11 June 1937 in Adelaide ) is an Australian pathologist , Nobel Laureate and researcher who is credited with the 1979 re-discovery of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori , together with Barry Marshall . He received his MBBS degree from the University of Adelaide , having completed his high school education at St Peter 's College , Adelaide . In 1967 he was admitted into the Royal College of Pathologists of Australia and became a senior pathologist at the Royal Perth Hospital where he spent the majority of his career . At the University of Western Australia with his colleague Barry J. Marshall , Warren proved that the bacterium is the cause of stomach ulcers . Warren helped develop a convenient diagnostic test ( 14C-urea breath-test ) for detecting H. pylori in ulcer patients . In 2005 , Warren and Marshall were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine . He married Winifred Theresa Warren and together they had five children , from oldest to youngest , John , David , Patrick , Andrew and Rebecca . Winifred Warren went on to become an accomplished psychiatrist . An Australian documentary was made in 2006 about Warren and Marshall 's road to the Nobel Prize , called `` The Winner 's Guide to the Nobel Prize '' . He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2007 .
Montcornet is a commune in the Aisne department in Picardy in northern France . On 14 May 1940 , Charles de Gaulle was given command of the new 4th Armored Division and ordered to execute a counterattack toward Montcornet , with the objective of slowing the German advance . This was one of the only counterattacks of the French campaign that succeeded in repulsing the German troops .
Her Majesty 's Most Loyal Opposition , or the Official Opposition , in the United Kingdom is led by the Leader of the Opposition . This is usually the political party with the second-largest number of seats in the House of Commons , as the largest party will usually form Her Majesty 's Government . Since May 2010 , the Official Opposition has been the Labor Party . The phrase His Majesty 's Opposition was coined in 1826 , before the advent of the modern two-party system , when Parliament consisted more of interests , relationships and factions rather than the highly coherent political parties of today ( although the Whigs and Tories were the two main parties ) . Attacking the Foreign Secretary , George Canning in the House of Commons , John Hobhouse said : The phrase was widely welcomed and has been in use ever since . Whilst most days in the House of Commons are set aside for government business , twenty days in each session are set aside for opposition debates . Of these days , seventeen are at the disposal of the Leader of the Opposition and three can be used by the leader of the smaller , or Tertiary , opposition party ( for most recent history this has been the Liberal Democrats ) . Although the Opposition has no more formal powers in setting the Parliamentary agenda , in reality they have a certain influence through a process known as the usual channels . The Leader of Her Majesty 's Most Loyal Opposition is often seen as the Prime Minister-in-waiting ; as well as his salary as an MP , he or she receives a statutory salary and perquisites like those of a cabinet minister , including appointment as a Privy Councillor . Since 1915 , the Leader of the Opposition has , like the Prime Minister , always been a member of the House of Commons . Before that a member of the House of Lords sometimes took on the role , although often there was no overall Leader of the Opposition . Although there has never been a dispute as to who holds the position , under the Ministerial and other Salaries Act 1975 , the Speakerâ s decision on the identity of the Leader of the Opposition is final . The current Leader of the Opposition is Ed Miliband , elected leader of the Labor Party on 25 September 2010 . The most public parliamentary function of the Leader of the Opposition is Prime Minister 's Questions ( PMQs ) , currently a 30 minute session held on Wednesday afternoons when Parliament is sitting . The Leader of the Opposition has six questions , which he usually splits into two sets . Other backbench opposition MPs also have the right to question the Prime Minister ; they are selected either through a ballot , or by `` catching the Speaker 's eye '' . By convention , other Shadow Cabinet members do not question the Prime Minister at PMQs , except when standing-in for the Leader . Every government department is subjected to questions in the House of Commons , and the House of Lords . As with PMQs , the official opposition spokesmen are allocated a number of questions , and in addition backbench MPs are free to ask questions . In the House of Lords , opposition spokesmen also question the government . This is one of the reasons why every government department ( and opposition shadow department ) has at least one member of parliament and one peer in it . As is usual with Westminster systems , and other statutory assemblies and councils in the UK , the government and its supporters sit to the Speaker 's right , whilst the Opposition parties sit to his\/her left . Currently , members from the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties ( which form the Government in coalition ) sit to the Speaker 's right , and members from the Labor Party and other minor parties sit to the Speaker 's left .
The British Rail Class EB1 ( Electric Banking 1 ) was an electrically powered locomotive used by British Rail in England . It was used during the pre-TOPS period . The other NER electric locos built at the same time were classified as EB1 but were never modified , they later became British Rail Class EF1 . These locomotives were built by the NER to haul coal trains from the mines at Shildon to the docks at Middlesbrough . During the 1920s the coal traffic declined and some of the locomotives became surplus to requirements . In 1928 a plan was devised to convert one of them to a Diesel-electric , using a 1,000 hp Beardmore diesel engine driving an English Electric generator . This plan did not come to fruition . Electric traction on the Shildon line was discontinued in 1935 but the locomotives were retained for possible future use . Number 11 ( later BR 26510 ) was rebuilt in 1942 for use on the Manchester-Sheffield line . Horsepower was increased from 1,100 to 1,256 and the twin pantographs were replaced by a single central one . In common with other LNER electric locomotives , no classification was given to the locomotive until 4 October 1945 , when nos. 3-12 were all classified EB1 ( Electric Banking 1 ) . It was expected that all the locomotives would be similarly modified but this did not happen . In 1949 , number 26510 was moved to Ilford Depot ( Eastern Region ) for use as a shunter , but the others were reclassified EF1 ( Electric Freight 1 ) . Number 26510 was transferred to departmental stock ( as DS100 ) in January 1959 and withdrawn in April 1964 .
Sagittarius ( â ) is the ninth astrological sign in the Zodiac , originating from the constellation of Sagittarius . Sagittarius is considered a `` masculine '' , positive ( extrovert ) sign . It is also a fire sign and one of the four mutable signs . Sagittarius is ruled by the planet Jupiter . Individuals born when the sun was in this sign are considered Sagittarius individuals . Under the tropical zodiac , the sun enters Sagittarius on November 22 and exits on December 21 . Under the sidereal zodiac , it is currently there roughly from December 17 to January 20 . In Greek mythology , Sagittarius is identified as a centaur : half human , half horse . In some legends , the Centaur Chiron was the son of Philyra and Saturn , who said to have changed himself into a horse to escape his jealous wife , Rhea . Chiron was eventually immortalized in the constellation of Centaurus or in some versions , Sagittarius Generally , they are considered to be compatible with the natives of the other fire signs , Aries and Leo the natives of the air signs , Gemini , Libra and Aquarius . Virgo and Pisces are signs of the other nature ( feminine\/introverted ) , but are considered semi-compatible with Sagittarius due to their having the same mutable quality . There are many variables that determine compatibility in astrology , such as birth dates , birth months , personalities , birth years , position of a sign within the Sun , the Moon , Stars , planets , etc. . The signs listed as compatible with Sagittarius do not reflect an individual profile or individual reading as interpreted within astrology , but rather reflect a general guideline and reference to compatibility as dictated by variables such as Qualities and Elements within the Zodiac . The branch in astrology dealing with interpersonal compatibilities is called Synastry .

The Portuguese Wikipedia is a Portuguese language edition of Wikipedia ( written WikipÃ dia , in Portuguese ) , the free encyclopedia . It was the fifth edition of Wikipedia , started in June 2001 . It is currently the eighth largest Wikipedia by article count , containing articles . From late 2004 , the edition grew rapidly . During May 2005 , it overtook both the Spanish and Italian language Wikipedias . By comparison , in May 2004 it was only the 17th Wikipedia by the number of articles . In December 2010 , the Portuguese Wikipedia overtook the Dutch language Wikipedia in number of articles , ranking in the eighth position . Portuguese articles can contain variations of writing , as European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese have variations in vocabulary and usage . Articles can contain written characteristics of one or the other variant depending on who wrote the article . In 2005 , a proposal to fork Portuguese Wikipedia and create a Brazilian Portuguese ( pt-br ) version was voted down by the Wikimedia community . The Portuguese language Wikipedia is different from the English one in a number of aspects .
Friendship was an Australian First Fleet transport ship , built in Scarborough , England , in 1784 . A brig of 278 tons , she was among the smallest of the transports . Her master was Francis Walton and surgeon Thomas Arndell . She left Portsmouth on 13 May 1787 , carrying seventy-six male and twenty-one female convicts . The female convicts were transferred to other transports at the Cape of Good Hope to make room for livestock purchased there . She arrived at Port Jackson , Sydney , Australia , on 26 January 1788 . The Friendship left Port Jackson on 14 July 1788 in company with Alexander . The crews of both ships were so badly affected by scurvy off the coast of Borneo that enough healthy sailors remained for only one working ship , and the Friendship was deliberately sunk ( scuttled ) on the 28th of October 1788 .
A Sertoli cell ( a kind of sustentacular cell ) is a ` nurse ' cell of the testes that is part of a seminiferous tubule . It is activated by follicle-stimulating hormone and has FSH-receptor on its membranes . Because its main function is to nurture the developing sperm cells through the stages of spermatogenesis , the Sertoli cell has also been called the `` mother '' or `` nurse '' cell . Sertoli cells also act as phagocytes , consuming the residual cytoplasm during spermatogenesis . Translocation of germ cells from the base to the lumen of the seminiferous tubules occurs by conformational changes in the lateral margins of the sertoli cells . The tight junctions of Sertoli cells form the blood-testis barrier , a structure that partitions the interstitial blood compartment of the testis from the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous tubules . Because of the apical progression of the spermatogonia , the tight junctions must be dynamically reformed and broken to allow the immunoidentical spermatogonia to cross through the blood-testis barrier so they can become immunologically unique . Sertoli cells control the entry and exit of nutrients , hormones and other chemicals into the tubules of the testis as well as make the adluminal compartment an immune-privileged site . The cell is also responsible for establishing and maintaining the spermatogonial stem cell niche , which ensures the renewal of stem cells and the differentiation of spermatogonia into mature germ cells that progress stepwise through the long process of spermatogenesis , ending in the release of spermatozoa . Sertoli cells bind to spermatogonial cells via N-cadherins and galctosyltransferase ( via carbohydrate residues ) . During the Maturation phase of spermiogenesis , the Sertoli cells consume the unneeded portions of the spermatozoa . Once fully differentiated , the Sertoli cell is unable to proliferate . Therefore , once spermatogenesis has begun , no more Sertoli cells are created . Recently however , some scientists have found a way to grow these cells outside of the body . This gives rise to the possibility of repairing some defects that cause male infertility . It has been suggested that they may derive from mesonephros . Sertoli cells are called so because of their eponym Enrico Sertoli , an Italian physiologist who discovered them while studying medicine in the University of Pavia , Italy . He published a description of this cell in 1865 . The cell was discovered by Sertoli with a Belthle microscope purchased in 1862 , which he used while studying medicine . In the 1865 publication , his first description used the terms `` tree-like cell '' or `` stringy cell '' and most importantly he referred to these `` mother cells . '' It was other scientists who used Enrico 's family name , Sertoli , to label these cell in publications , starting in 1888 . As of 2006 , two textbooks that are devoted specifically to the Sertoli cell have been published . On slides , using standard staining , it can be easy to confuse the Sertoli cells with the other cells of the germinal epithelium . The most distinctive feature of the Sertoli cells is the dark nucleolus . Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor are part of the sex cord-stromal tumor group of ovarian neoplasms .
Eduardo De Filippo ( 24 May 1900 - 31 October 1984 ) was an Italian actor , playwright , screenwriter , author and poet , best known for his Neapolitan works Filumena Marturano and Napoli Milionaria . De Filippo was born in Naples to playwright Eduardo Scarpetta and theater seamstress and costumier Luisa De Filippo . He began acting at the age of five and in 1932 formed a theater company with his brother Peppino and sister Titina . Peppino left the troupe in 1944 and Titina departed by the early 1950s . De Filippo starred in De Sica 's L'oro di Napoli with TotÃ and Sophia Loren in 1954 . His translation of Shakespeare 's The Tempest into Neapolitan was published in 1982 . In 1981 , De Filippo was appointed life senator of the Italian Republic . He died four years later in Rome . His artistic legacy has been carried over by his son .

The pelycosaurs ( from Greek Ï Î Î '' Ï Î 3\/4 - pelyx `` axe '' or perhaps `` bowl '' \/ `` pelvis '' and Ï Î á Ï Î Ï sauros `` lizard '' ) were primitive Late Paleozoic synapsid amniotes . Some species were quite large and could grow up to 3 meters or more , although most species were much smaller . The pelycosaurs appeared during the Late Carboniferous and reached their acme in the early part of the Permian Period , remaining the dominant land animals for some 40 million years . A few continued into the late Permian . They were succeeded by the therapsids . At least two pelycosaur clades independently evolved a tall sail , consisting of elongated vertebral spines : the edaphosaurids and the sphenacodontids . In life , this would have been covered by skin , and possibly functioned as a thermoregulatory device and\/or for mating display . Pelycosaur fossils have been found mainly in Europe and North America , although some small , late-surviving forms are known from Russia and South Africa . Unlike lepidosaurian reptiles , pelycosaurs lacked epidermal scales . Fossil evidence from some ophiacodonts shows that parts of the skin was naked , but that the belly was covered in dermal scutes , looking like the scutes present in other reptile groups , which are of a different type of structure . Dermal scutes are also found in a diverse number of extant mammals with conservative body types , such as in the tails of certain rodents , sengis , moonrats , the opossums and other marsupials , and as regular dermal armor with underlying bone in the armadillo . In 1940 the group was reviewed in detail and every species known at the time described ( and many illustrated ) in an important monograph by Alfred Sherwood Romer and Llewellyn Price . Pelycosauria is a paraphyletic taxon because it excludes the therapsids . For that reason the term is not used in some modern books . Eupelycosauria is used to designate the clade that includes most Pelycosaurs along with the Therapsida and the Mammals . In contrast to `` Pelycosaurs '' , this is a monophyletic group . Caseasauria refers to a pelycosaur side-branch or clade that did not leave any descendants . The pelycosaurs appear to have been a group of synapsids that had direct ancestral links with the mammalia , having differentiated teeth and a developing hard palate . Well-known pelycosaurs include the genera Dimetrodon , Sphenacodon , Edaphosaurus , and Ophiacodon . In traditional classification , the order Pelycosauria is paraphyletic -- that is , it is a grouping of animals that does not contain all descendants of a common ancestor , as is often required by a different system of naming organisms , phylogenetic nomenclature . In the latter , Pelycosauria is treated as a clade rather than a taxon with the rank `` order '' , and includes the clade Therapsida , which in turn contains the clade Mammalia . In traditional taxonomy , Therapsida is separated from Pelycosauria in its own biological order , and mammals are separated from both as their own class . In phylogenetic nomenclature , the `` Pelycosauria '' is not used , since it does not constitute a clade ( a group of organisms descended from one common ancestor and including all the descendants of that ancestor ) because the group excludes the therapsids . Instead , it represents a paraphyletic `` grade '' of basal synapsids leading up to the clade Therapsida . The following cladogram follows the one found on Mikko 's Phylogeny Archive .

TV Tokyo Corporation ( or TX ) is a television station headquartered in Toranomon , Minato , Tokyo , Japan . Also known as `` Teleto '' , a blend of `` terebi '' and `` Tokyo '' , it is the key station of TX Network . It is one of the major Tokyo television stations , particularly specializing in anime . The station is co-owned by Nihon Keizai Shimbun and Mainichi Broadcasting System , with the former owning the majority share . TV Tokyo was started on April 12 , 1964 by the Japan Science Promotion Foundation . A limited liability company , Tokyo Channel 12 Production , was formed for the channel on July 1 , 1968 . In October 1973 , the name was shortened to Tokyo Channel 12 and took over the broadcasting from the foundation . In 1981 , it again renamed itself , this time to Television Tokyo Channel 12 . In 1983 , TV Tokyo formed the Mega TON Network ( now TXN ) with TV Osaka , and Aichi Television Broadcasting . The company shifted its head offices from Shiba Park to Toranomon in December 1985 . On June 25 , 2004 , the company assumed its current English name of TV Tokyo Corporation .
Ben Folds Five was an alternative rock trio formed in 1993 in Chapel Hill , North Carolina . The group comprised Ben Folds ( vocals , piano , and principal songwriting ) , Robert Sledge ( bass guitar and backing vocals ) , and Darren Jessee ( drums , backing vocals and co-writer for some songs ) . The group achieved mainstream success in the alternative , indie and pop music scenes . The band is best known for the hit single `` Brick '' from their 1997 album Whatever and Ever Amen , which gained airplay on many mainstream radio stations . Much of Ben Folds Five 's work was influenced by jazz , evident in frequent improv-styled passages through bridge and\/or ending . During their seven years together , the band released three proper studio records , one retrospective album of B-sides and outtakes , and eight singles . They also contributed to a number of soundtracks and compilations . Ben Folds Five disbanded in October 2000 , apparently under amicable circumstances . The group reunited for a one-off concert on September 18 , 2008 , where they played their final album , The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner , in its entirety . Ben Folds Five was formed in 1993 in Chapel Hill by Ben Folds . They were , in fact , a trio in spite of their name , and the primary motivation behind the name , apart from the band 's well-known use of humor , was simple preference , according to Ben : `` I think it sounds better than Ben Folds Three . '' Folds once described their music as `` punk rock for sissies , '' a reaction to the angst prevalent in '90s rock . Their first radio single was `` Underground '' from their self-titled debut album , released in 1995 on Caroline Records . The band 's biggest success was the single `` Brick '' from their second album , Whatever and Ever Amen , released in 1997 . It was followed by the more somber and jazz-based 1999 album , The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner . The group contributed an outtake from the Reinhold Messner sessions , titled `` Leather Jacket , '' to the 1999 benefit album , No Boundaries : A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees . The band 's final released recording was a cover of Steely Dan 's `` Barrytown '' for the Me , Myself & Irene soundtrack . The band had begun work on a fourth studio album , however following the worldwide tour in support of The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner , the band `` amicably '' broke up in October 2000 . Tracks from the sessions would later emerge on subsequent solo projects . Folds went on to pursue a successful solo career , releasing Rockin the Suburbs in 2001 , Songs for Silverman in 2005 , and Way to Normal in 2008 . Jessee formed acclaimed indie band Hotel Lights , releasing Hotel Lights in 2005 , Goodnightgoodmorning in 2006 , and Firecracker People in 2008 . Robert Sledge soon after took up singing , shared song-writing and bass playing duties with International Orange , but the group disbanded in 2005 . He subsequently formed The Bob Sledge Band , which plays locally in North Carolina . Ben Folds Five made a one-off concert appearance in September 2008 at the UNC Memorial Hall in Chapel Hill as part of the MySpace `` Front to Back '' series , in which artists play an entire album live . The band played its final album , The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner , and were briefly joined on stage by Ben 's father , Dean Folds , who read a transcript of his voice mail message that is used in the album song `` Your Most Valuable Possession , '' encoring with some of the songs from their first two albums .
SighiÅ oara ( ; ; Hungarian pronunciation : ; ) is a city and municipality on the TÃ cents rnava Mare River in MureÅ County , Romania . Located in the historic region Transylvania , SighiÅ oara has a population of 32,287 ( 2002 ) . During the 12th century , German craftsmen and merchants known as the Transylvanian Saxons were invited to Transylvania by the King of Hungary to settle and defend the frontier of his realm . The chronicler Krauss lists a Saxon settlement in the actual Sighiá # oara by 1191 . By 1298 by the Saxon name of Schespurch resp . Schaesbrich . By 1337 SighiÅ oara had become a royal center for the kings , who awarded the settlement urban status in 1367 as the Civitas de Segusvar . The city played an important strategic and commercial role at the edges of Central Europe for several centuries . SighiÅ oara became one of the most important cities of Transylvania , with artisans from throughout the Holy Roman Empire visiting the settlement . The German artisans and craftsmen dominated the urban economy , as well as building the fortifications protecting it . It is estimated that during the 16th and the 17th centuries SighiÅ oara had as many as 15 guilds and 20 handicraft branches . The Baroque sculptor Elias Nicolai lived in the city . The Wallachian prince Vlad Dracul ( father of Vlad the Impaler ( Dracula ) , who lived in exile in the town , let coins to be minted in the city ( otherwise coinage was the monopoly of the Hungarian kings in the Kingdom of Hungary ) and issued the first document listing the city 's Romanian name , SighiÅ oara . The city was the setting for George I RÃ kÃ czi 's election as Prince of Transylvania and King of Hungary in 1631 . SighiÅ oara suffered military occupation , fires , and plagues during the 17th and 18th centuries . Important source for the history of the 17th century Transylvania , for the period of 1606-1666 , the records of Georg Kraus , the town 's notary . The nearby plain of AlbeÅ ti was the site of the Battle of SegesvÃ r , where the revolutionary Hungarian army led by JÃ zef Bem was defeated by the Russian army led by Luders on 31 July 1849 . A monument was constructed in 1852 to the Russian general Skariatin , who died in the battle . The Hungarian poet SÃ ndor PetÅ ` fi is generally believed to have been killed in the battle , and a monument was constructed in his honor at AlbeÅ ti in 1897 . After World War I SighiÅ oara passed with Transylvania from Austria-Hungary to the Kingdom of Romania . Central SighiÅ oara has preserved in an exemplary way the features of a small medieval fortified city , it has been listed by the UNESCO as a World Heritage Site . Each year , a Medieval Festival takes place in the old citadel in July . SighiÅ oara is considered to be the most beautiful and well preserved inhabited citadel in Europe , with an authentic medieval architecture . In Eastern Europe , SighiÅ oara is one of the few fortified towns which are still inhabited . The town is made up of two parts . The medieval stronghold was built on top of a hill and is known as the `` Citadel '' ( Cetate ) . The lower town lies in the valley of TÃ cents rnava Mare river . The houses inside SighiÅ oara Citadel show the main features of a craftsmen 's town . However , there are some houses which belonged to the former patriciate , like the Venetian House and the House with Antlers . In 2001-2003 the construction of a Dracula theme park in the ` Breite ' nature preserve near SighiÅ oara was considered but ultimately rejected , due to the strong opposition of local civil society groups and national and international media as well as politically influential persons , as the theme park would have detracted from the medieval style of the city and would have destroyed the nature preserve . SighiÅ oara is a popular tourist destination , due to its well-preserved walled old town . The landmark of the city is the Clock Tower , a 64m high tower built in the 13th century . It is today a museum of history .
Thebes ( , ThÄ `` bai , , á Ä `` bah ) is the Greek name for a city in Ancient Egypt located about 800 km south of the Mediterranean , on the east bank of the river Nile . The Theban Necropolis is located nearby on the west bank of the Nile . Thebes was inhabited from around 3200 BC . It was the eponymous capital of Waset , the fourth Upper Egyptian nome . Waset was the capital of Egypt during part of the 11th Dynasty ( Middle Kingdom ) and most of the 18th Dynasty ( New Kingdom ) , when Hatshepsut built a Red Sea fleet to facilitate trade between Thebes Red Sea port of Elim , modern Quasir , and Elat at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba . Traders bought frankincense , myrrh , bitumen , natron , fine woven linen , juniper oil and copper amulets for the mortuary industry at Karnak with Nubian gold . With the 19th Dynasty the seat of government moved to the Delta . The archaeological remains of Thebes offer a striking testimony to Egyptian civilization at its height . The Greek poet Homer extolled the wealth of Thebes in the Iliad , Book 9 ( c. 8th Century BC ) : '' ... in Egyptian Thebes the heaps of precious ingots gleam , the hundred-gated Thebes . '' The name Thebai is the Greek designation of the ancient Egyptian opet `` The Karnak Temple '' ( from coptic ta-pe , Ta-opet became Thebai ) . At the seat of the Theban triad of Amun , Mut , and Khonsu , Thebes was known in the Egyptian language from the end of the New Kingdom as niwt-imn , `` The City of Amun . '' This found its way into the Hebrew Bible as nÅ Ê 1\/4 Ê 1\/4 Ä mÃ n ( Nahum 3:8 ) , `` no '' in Hebrew meaning city with `` no amon '' or `` City of Amon '' referring to the Egyptian deity Amon-Ra , most likely it is also the same as ( `` No '' ) ( Ezekiel 30:14 ) . In Greek this name was rendered Diospolis , `` City of Zeus '' , as Zeus was the god whom the Greeks identified with Amun , see interpretatio graeca . The Greeks surnamed the city megale , `` the Great '' , to differentiate it from numerous other cities called Diospolis . The Romans rendered the name Diospolis Magna . In modern usage , the mortuary temples and tombs on the west bank of the river Nile are generally thought of as part of Thebes . In 1979 , the ruins of ancient Thebes were inscribed by UNESCO as a World Cultural Heritage site . The two great temples , now called Luxor ( Arabic : Ø Ù Ø # Ù Ø Ø , Al-Uq á # ur , `` The palaces '' ) and al-Karnak ( Ø Ù Ù Ø Ù Ù ) , the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens are among the great achievements of ancient Egypt . The site of Thebes is populated at least since the Middle Paleolithic .
British Rail 18000 was a prototype mainline gas turbine-electric locomotive built for British Railways in 1949 by Brown , Boveri & Cie. It had , however , been ordered by the Great Western Railway in 1946 , but construction was delayed due to World War II . It spent its working life on the Western Region of British Railways , operating express passenger services from London Paddington station . The GWR chose a gas-turbine locomotive because , at the time , there was no single-unit diesel locomotive of sufficient power available . The King class steam locomotive could deliver about 2500 h at the rail . The LMS diesel locomotives had engines of only 1600 h. After allowing for transmission losses , this would be down to about 1300 h at the rail , so two diesels would be needed to match a King . No. 18000 was of A1A-A1A wheel arrangement and its gas turbine was rated at 2500 h. It had a maximum speed of 90 m and weighed 115 L. It was painted in BR black livery , with a silver stripe around the middle of the body and silver numbers . The gas turbine was a Brown Boveri industrial machine . It was of a type which would now be called a turboshaft engine but differed from modern turboshaft engines in having only one turbine to drive both the compressor and the output shaft . The emphasis was on fuel economy so it had a heat exchanger ( to recover waste heat from the exhaust ) and was designed to run on cheap heavy fuel oil ( it was also able to burn light oil but this was intended only for startup purposes ) . This was the same fuel that was used in oil-fired steam locomotives . After leaving the heat exchanger , the pre-heated air entered a large , vertical , combustion chamber where the fuel was injected and burned . There was also an auxiliary diesel engine which provided power for starting the gas turbine . The diesel engine was capable of moving the locomotive at a slow speed when the gas turbine was not running . The usual procedure was to run the locomotive from the shed to Paddington station using the diesel engine and to start the gas turbine only a few minutes before the train was due to leave . This saved fuel and minimized annoyance from noise and exhaust fumes . It proved a troublesome machine in service . Ash from the heavy fuel oil damaged the turbine blades , and the combustion chamber liner required frequent replacement due to damage . The electrical control systems were extremely complex for the time and gave much trouble ; maintenance of the electrical equipment in a steam locomotive environment and knowledge base was difficult . Part way through its life one of the traction motors failed and instead of repairing or replacing it , it was simply removed , leaving the locomotive with only three traction motors and preventing it from achieving its full power output . It also suffered from the destruction of its heat exchanger in a fire at Temple Meads when combustion deposits in the exhaust side of the heat exchanger ignited . It was also heavier than expected in fuel costs . The efficiency of a gas turbine reduces dramatically at low power outputs so to achieve respectable fuel economy a gas turbine locomotive needs to be operated as much as possible at full power , with periods of part-load running reduced to a minimum . However , it turned out that even on demanding express passenger schedules it was not possible to operate the locomotive on full power for very much of the run and extended periods of part-load operation were inevitable , which resulted in heavy fuel consumption . It was also sometimes fuelled on the much more expensive and scarce light oil normally used only for starting , due to the level of wear caused by the ash from heavy fuel oil . When reliable operation could be achieved it did show itself capable of meeting expectations . Unfortunately it was never possible to achieve an acceptable level of reliability nor to operate it under conditions which would allow reasonable fuel economy . The following table gives a comparison between 18000 and 18100 . There are some anomalies and these are described in the notes . At the end of 1960 18000 was withdrawn from operation and was stored at Swindon Works for four years . It then returned to mainland Europe , where for more than ten years it was used , in substantially altered ( and no longer gas-turbine-powered ) form , for experiments concerning the interaction between steel wheels and steel rails , under the auspices of the International Union of Railways . In 1975 it was moved to Vienna and displayed outside the Mechanical Engineering Testing building . In the early 1990s it was secured for preservation ; it returned to the UK and was kept at The Railway Age , Crewe . It has now been moved to Barrow Hill Engine Shed and been repainted in a green livery . It was due to move to Didcot Railway Centre before the end of 2008 but was still at Barrow Hill in August 2009 . In mid-April 2010 it was delivered to the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway in order to take part ( as a static exhibit ) in the celebrations for the 175th birthday of the Great Western Railway from 29 May to 6 June 2010 .

Reginald Abbott ( born February 4 , 1930 in Winnipeg , Manitoba ) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player . As a youth in Winnipeg , Abbott was an outstanding all-round athlete . He played baseball as the second baseman for the provincial champion Rosedales in Manitoba . He also was a near-scratch golfer and a good lacrosse player before dedicating his career to ice hockey in his teens . Abbott began his professional career with the Victoria Cougars where he spent four seasons . During this time , he played three games in the National Hockey League in 1952 â `` 53 for the Montreal Canadiens . During those three games , he did not score any points nor did he earn any penalty minutes . Apart from three games in the American Hockey League with the Pittsburgh Hornets , Abbott would spent the next five seasons playing senior hockey for the Windsor Bulldogs . Afterwards he would play sparingly with the Winnipeg Maroons and the Clinton Comets before retiring . He played for the Canadian National Team in the 1965 World Championships which finished fourth .
Strathaven ( ; Gaelic : Strath Aibhne , meaning : valley of the Avon ) is a historic market town in South Lanarkshire , Scotland . The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1450 , making the Town of Strathaven a burgh of barony . The town 's principal industry was primarily weaving in the 19th and early 20th centuries , however this declined when faced by competition from Glasgow . The industrial revolution bypassed the town as it had little to offer in the way of natural resources , and thus has grown into more a commuter settlement , however it retains its function as a service center for the surrounding area of Avondale . The current population is 7,700 . The town is located on the edge of the valley of the Avon Water , around 6 miles from Hamilton , and 23 miles from Glasgow . The A71 , which connects Edinburgh and Kilmarnock passes through the town . In the 2001 census the town had a population of 7,700 . Strathaven has one secondary school and three primary schools - Kirklandpark Primary , Wester Overton Primary , and St Patrick 's Primary . It also has a grass airfield about two miles to the north west , on Lethame Road . Strathaven has a long history as a market town . A Roman road passes close by , on the south side of the Avon Water , which led to the Roman fort at Loudoun Hill near Darvel . The origins of Strathaven Castle are obscure , but it is believed to have been built around 1350 by the Bairds , on a bend of the Powmillon Burn . Today it is a ruin , with a single tower and sections of wall remaining beside the A71 . The Barony of Strathaven was acquired in 1362 by Archibald the Grim , Lord of Galloway , by his marriage to Joanna , daughter to Maurice de Moravia , 1st Earl of Strathearn , great Moray heiress . The settlement within the lands of Strathaven became a Burgh of barony in 1450 . It still retains its traditional character despite the growth of more modern housing . The center of the town is occupied by the market square , formerly a grassed common , and still known as Common Green , or just ` The Green ' . Linking the town and the castle is the old ` Boo Backit Brig ' ( ` bow-backed bridge ' ) , a small arched bridge . The Old Parish Church , with its landmark spire , was built in 1772 , and was the place of worship of the Dukes of Hamilton who maintained a shooting lodge at nearby Dungavel House . The town prospered in the 18th and 19th centuries as a weaving town , although there were many merchants living here too . The town played a significant part in the Radical War of 1820 , when James Wilson led a band of radicals on a march to Glasgow , to join a rumored general uprising , which never actually happened . Wilson was hanged for treason , and in 1846 a memorial was built in his honor in the town cemetery . The history of Strathaven is now documented in the town 's John Hastie Museum . Its most famous ` modern ' resident was Sir Harry Lauder ( 1870 â `` 1950 ) whose mansion , Lauder Ha ' , or Hall , was just above the town on the road to Kilmarnock . Sir Harry spent the Second World War years there , and died in February 1950 . The family retained the property until Death Duties of 65 % forced a sale in the late 1960s . It remains a private residence . Despite competition from the nearby large towns of East Kilbride and Hamilton , Strathaven still has a number of craft and gift shops , alongside well known town center names . There are the usual high street banks . Strathaven had , at various times , three railway stations . Strathaven 's Sport Centre underwent refurbishment in 2009 as a result of the demolition and reconstruction of Strathaven Academy . Sport facilities in Strathaven include an Indoor Swimming pool and Gym , 3 Grass football pitches , 2 Ash Football Pitches , 4 Tennis Courts , 2 Rugby pitches and several Badminton courts in Church and Primary school halls .

The Country Music Association Awards , also known as the CMA Awards , or the CMAs , and not to be confused with the ACM Awards , are voted on by business members of the Country Music Association . The first CMA awards were presented at an untelevised ceremony in Nashville 's Municipal Auditorium in 1967 . ( The Entertainer of the Year award that night went to Eddy Arnold . ) The second annual CMA awards were presented in October 1968 ; NBC taped the ceremony and broadcast it a few weeks later ) . Beginning in 1969 , the awards were televised live , usually during October or November of each year . They continued to be broadcast on NBC until switching to CBS in 1972 , where they remained until 2005 . Starting in November 2006 , the Annual CMA Awards are televised on ABC . The CMA Awards , for many years , were held at the home of Nashville 's Grand Ole Opry ; initially at the Ryman Auditorium , and from 1974 to 2004 at the Grand Ole Opry House . The 2005 ceremonies took place in New York City at Madison Square Garden . The awards show has been held at Nashville 's Bridgestone Arena since 2006 . Annual awards are given in the following twelve categories : Entertainer , Male Vocalist , Female Vocalist , New Artist ( previously known as the Horizon Award until 2008 ) , Vocal Group , Vocal Duo ( introduced in 1970 ) , Single , Album , Song , Musical Event ( split off from the Vocal Duo award in 1988 as Vocal Event ) , Music Video ( introduced in 1985 ) , and Musician . The distinction between the Duo and Event awards is that the former is presented to two artists who normally perform together , while the latter was specifically created to honor one-off collaborations . Nine awards are also given to radio broadcasters for Station of the Year and Personality of the Year ( divided into four categories each , based on market size ) , as well as National Personality of the Year to the host of a nationally-syndicated show . The show featured performances from top country music stars as well as up-and-coming new artists who perform snippets of their hit songs before going to a commercial ( the new artist bumpers were discontinued in 2002 ) .
For other uses , see Pan ( disambiguation ) . For the moon of Jupiter formerly known by this name , see Carme ( moon ) . Pan is the innermost moon of Saturn . It is a walnut-shaped small moon about 35 kilometres across and 23 km high that orbits within the Encke Gap in Saturn 's A Ring . Pan acts as a ring shepherd and is responsible for keeping the Encke Gap free of ring particles . It was discovered by Mark R. Showalter in 1990 from analysis of old Voyager 2 probe photos and received the provisional designation ' because the discovery images dated back to 1981 . The existence of a moon in the Encke Gap was first predicted by Jeffrey N. Cuzzi and Jeffrey D. Scargle in 1985 , based on wavy edges of the gap which indicated a gravitational disturbance . In 1986 Showalter et al . inferred its orbit and mass by modeling its gravitational wake . They arrived at a very precise prediction of 133,603 Â 10 km for the semi-major axis and a mass of 5 -- 10Saturn masses , and inferred that there was only a single moon within the Encke gap . The actual semi-major axis differs by 19 km and the actual mass is 8.6 of Saturn 's . The moon was later found within 1 Â of the predicted position . The search was undertaken by considering all Voyager 2 images and using a computer calculation to predict whether the moon would be visible under sufficiently favorable conditions in each one . Every qualifying Voyager 2 image with resolution better than ~ 50 km\/pixel shows Pan clearly . In all , it appears in eleven Voyager 2 images . The eccentricity of Pan 's orbit causes its distance from Saturn to vary by ~ 4 km . Its inclination , which would cause it to move up and down , is not distinguishable from zero with present data . The Encke Gap , within which Pan orbits , is about 325 km wide . Cassini scientists have described Pan as `` walnut-shaped '' owing to the equatorial ridge , similar to that on Atlas , that is visible in images . The ridge is due to ring material that Pan has swept up from the Encke gap . The Encke Gap contains a ringlet that is coincident with Pan 's orbit , indicating that Pan maintains the particles in horseshoe orbits . A second ringlet is periodically disrupted by Pan similarly to how the F Ring is disturbed by Prometheus . The moon was named on 16 September 1991 , after the mythological Pan , who was ( among other things ) the god of shepherds . This is a reference to Pan 's role as a shepherd moon . It is also designated ' . There is also an asteroid called 4450 Pan .
36 Crazyfists is a four-piece metal band originating from Anchorage , Alaska . They are now based in Portland , Oregon . The band 's name comes from a Jackie Chan movie , Jackie Chan And The 36 Crazy Fists . They have released six studio albums , In the Skin , Bitterness the Star , A Snow Capped Romance , Rest Inside the Flames , The Tide And Its Takers and Collisions and Castaways . 36 Crazyfists was formed in 1994 in Anchorage , Alaska . The original members were vocalist Brock Lindow , guitarists Steve Holt and Ryan Brownell , bassist JD Stuart , and drummer Thomas Noonan . Holt is from Kenai , and Lindow spent much of his childhood there . Lindow , Brownell , Stuart , and Noonan are all from Anchorage . They released their first EP , Boss Buckle , in 1995 on cassette . In July 1996 , bassist JD Stuart died in a car accident . At that time , Brownell retired from the band and the remaining members recruited bassist Mick Whitney , who is also from Anchorage . In 1997 , the band released their second EP , Suffer Tree . 36CF then relocated to Seattle , WA , where they released their full length debut CD , In the Skin . They next moved to Portland , OR . In 1999 , they released a 4-song demo that , through their friends in Skinlab , ended up in the hands of Monte Conner , A&R Rep at Roadrunner Records . Signed by Roadrunner Records in 2000 , the band recorded their major debut album Bitterness the Star which was released on April 4 , 2002 . In support of its release they toured with bands such as Candiria , God Forbid , Chimaira , Diecast , and Hotwire . After touring the United States , they headed off to Europe to begin the European Road Rage Tour with Killswitch Engage and Five Pointe O. The band re-emerged two years later , on March 16 , 2004 with their second album A Snow Capped Romance which was produced by James Paul Wisner ( who also produced albums for bands like Dashboard Confessional and As Friends Rust ) . They toured intensely behind the record ( playing shows with acts like Killswitch Engage and Poison the Well ) through December , taking two months off before beginning the work on their next album . 36 Crazyfists entered the studio with producer Sal Villanueva ( who had worked with Thursday and Taking Back Sunday ) in October 2005 to commence recording their third album Rest Inside the Flames which was released across Europe on June 12 , 2006 . Ultimately , Roadrunner decided not to release the album in North America . A deal with DRT Entertainment was later struck , and the album received a belated release on November 7 , 2006 . The album was a success in the U.K. , with Rest Inside the Flames debuting at # 71 on the UK album charts , and reaching # 2 in the BBC 's Rock Album charts . However , the album only sold 1,858 copies in the US during its first week of release . The band started an extensive U.K. tour , supported by Twelve Tribes and Your Rigamortus on April 1 , 2007 , where they played at 26 venues across the country . In May 2008 the band released The Tide And Its Takers , on Ferret Music .

The design of the coat of arms symbolizes several of the local geographic in political realities , such as the recent consolidation of the cities , the nationally prominent topographical depression , and the small river , the Wilster Au , which flows through the municipality . Cecilia Cheung Pak-Chi ( born 24 May 1980 ) is a Hong Kong actress and cantopop singer . She is the wife of Nicholas Tse , thus being the daughter-in-law of Patrick Tse ( è è cents ) and Deborah Lee ( ç æ cents æ ) . She and Nicholas have two sons , Lucas and Quintus Tse . She is considered a `` Sing girl '' -- an actress who first received media attention through starring alongside Stephen Chow , and later went on to have a successful career of her own . She was also involved in the 2008 Edison Chen photo scandal . Cheung was born in Hong Kong to a Cantonese father and a half Cantonese-half British mother . Her parents divorced when she was just a child after which she was sent to Australia to live with her aunt at the age of fourteen . She has an elder half-sister Dai Pek-Chi , two younger brothers and a younger half-brother from her father 's side . Her career began in 1998 , when she was offered to appear in a TV commercial advertising lemon tea . She caught the attention of Stephen Chow after shooting the ad . Later , Cheung made her film debut as a young nightclub hostess in Stephen Chow 's King of Comedy ( 1999 ) , followed soon after by Fly Me to Polaris ( 1999 ) . The latter role earned her the award for Best Newcomer at the Hong Kong Film Awards . In the same year , Cheung launched her singing career with her first Cantopop album Any Weather ( 1999 ) . For Derek Yee 's romantic drama Lost in Time ( 2003 ) , Cheung won the award for Best Actress at the 2004 Hong Kong Film Awards . She played a young woman who lost her fiancÃ to a traffic accident which left her as a grieving single mother struggling to make ends meet . Cheung has been linked to Hong Kong male singers such as Daniel Chan and Jordan Chan . She then dated Nicholas Tse in early 2002 , but then split with Tse late that year when Tse got back with his ex-girlfriend , singer Faye Wong . Later she was rumored to have dated a younger John Kim before the relationship ended in 2003 . Cheung suffered serious depression and eating disorders after the break-up with Tse . Cheung and Tse were first reported to be `` getting back together '' in early 2006 and on 31 July 2006 , Tse officially admitted dating Cheung in an interview with Commercial Radio Hong Kong 881\/903 . In September 2006 , Tse showed off his wedding ring at the Hong Kong International Airport , announcing he and Cheung had been married in a secret wedding ceremony in the Philippines . On the 8 January 2007 episode of TVB 's Entertainment Scoop ( æ å 1\/4 è æ ) , Nicholas ' father , Patrick Tse , confirmed that Cheung was approximately three months pregnant with the couple 's first child . Around March 2007 on the episode of TVB 's Entertainment Scoop ( æ å 1\/4 è æ ) it was said that their child , a baby boy , is due in August . On August 2 , 2007 , Cheung gave birth to a son , named Lucas . On May 12 , 2010 , she gave birth to the couple 's second son , Quintus . In 1999 , her triad member father got into a misunderstanding with a rival gang . As a result , Cheung received rape and death threats against her , when she was still relatively new in the film industry . In January and February 2008 , many explicit photos were found online involving Cecilia Cheung and Edison Chen .
Rocquefort is a commune in the Seine-Maritime department in the Haute-Normandie region in northern France . A farming village in the Pays de Caux , situated some 35 m northeast of Le Havre , between the D29 and D131 roads , by the banks of the river Durdent .
O ( Ð Ð 3\/4 ; italics : Ð Ð 3\/4 ) is a letter of the Cyrillic alphabet . O commonly represents the close-mid back rounded vowel \/ o \/ . The Cyrillic letter O was derived from the Greek letter Omicron ( Î Î ) . The name of O in the Early Cyrillic alphabet was ( onÅ ) , meaning `` he '' or `` it '' . In the Cyrillic numeral system , O had a value of 70 . The Cyrillic letter O looks exactly like the Latin letter O â O oâ and the Greek letter Omicron â Î Î â . In Russian , O is used word-initially , after another vowel , and after non-palatalized consonants . Because of a vowel reduction processes , the Russian \/ o \/ phoneme may have a number of pronunciations in unstressed syllables , including ( É ) and ( É ) .
While the term `` Pope '' ( Latin : papa `` father ' '' ) is used in several churches to denote their high spiritual leaders , this title in English usage generally refers to the supreme earthly head of the Catholic Church . The title itself has been used officially by the head of the Catholic Church since the tenure of Pope Siricius . There is no official list of popes , but the Annuario Pontificio , published every year by the Vatican , contains a list that is generally considered to be the most authoritative . Its list is used here . Several changes were made to the list during the 20th century . Antipope Christopher was considered legitimate for a long time . Pope-elect Stephen ( 23 March -- 26 March 752 ) , who died of apoplexy three days after his election and before his ordination as a bishop , was considered legitimate under the name Stephen II until the 1961 edition , at which time his name was removed . Although these changes are no longer controversial , a number of modern lists still include this `` first Pope Stephen II '' . It is probable that this is because they are based on the 1913 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia , which is in the public domain . This is a list of the 11 shortest-reigning popes . Pope-elect Stephen was elected on 23 March 752 and died only three days later ( 26 March ) . He is however , not officially recognized as a legitimate pope by the Catholic church , as he died before being ordained a bishop . In the 16th century , the Catholic church began officially recognizing him ; however , this view changed again in the 1960s and he was then removed from the official list of popes . The Roman Catholic Church recognizes Saint Peter as the first Pope ; however , sources differ on the length of his reign . Traditionally , St. Peter is said to have spent 25 years in Rome . However , since at least the time when Pope Pius IX completed his 25th year as Pope in 1871 , thus surpassing the traditional figure for Peter 's sojourn in Rome , Peter 's term as Pope has been reckoned from the time that Catholics consider Jesus to have bestowed the office upon him . This date can not be known with any certainty , but is taken to be about 30 A.D. , or perhaps 34 . To add to the uncertainty , two different death years are proposed for Peter , 64 A.D. and 67 A.D. . A reckoning of Peter as Pope for only the 25 years he traditionally spent in Rome would make him the fourth-longest-reigning pope . However , his papal office taken as a total of his leadership over the Church would have him having been Pope for 34 â `` 37 years . The validity of listing Peter among the list of longest reigning popes is debatable on a number of grounds . Some hold that St. Peter could not simultaneously be a bishop and an apostle . More significantly , the title of `` Pope '' - or even `` Bishop of Rome '' - is not attested in the first century . Of the various early Christian writers who refer to or address the church in Rome up through the mid-2nd century ( including Paul , Ignatius of Antioch , Hermas , and Justin Martyr ) , none either refers to or even seems to be aware of a single leader of the church there . This absence is particularly striking in the work of Ignatius , who is otherwise extremely sensitive to the office of the episcopate . The earliest claim to Peter as Rome 's first bishop is found in the Against Heresies of Irenaeus of Lyons , which was composed in the last quarter of the 2nd century . Irenaeus is clearly drawing on an already-existing list , presumably of Roman provenance ( perhaps obtained by Irenaeus when he served as an emissary to the Roman church from his own church in Lyons ) , but its reliability is debated . Roman Catholics consider Saint Peter the first Bishop of Rome . The 1953 discovery of bones belonging to an aged man of Semitic origin , buried underneath the altar of Saint Peter 's Basilica , according to legend , the traditional burial spot of the apostle Peter , is presented by Catholics as the most plausible proof that Peter lived in and was martyred in Rome . The tomb was also marked `` Herein lies Peter '' in Latin . By Catholic understanding , all later popes reign by virtue of their succession to Saint Peter in his office .
Nolan Baumgartner ( born March 23 , 1976 ) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman currently playing for the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League . Coming off a 1994 Memorial Cup championship with the Kamloops Blazers of the WHL , Baumgartner was chosen by the Washington Capitals in the first round , 10th overall of the 1994 NHL Entry Draft . Upon being drafted , he returned to the WHL and joined future NHLers Darcy Tucker , Shane Doan and Jarome Iginla to capture a second consecutive Memorial Cup in 1995 . Baumgartner was named to the Memorial Cup All-Star Team for the second consecutive year . En route to the CHL championship , Baumgartner was distinguished with the airBC Trophy as the WHL playoffs MVP after scoring 17 points in 21 games and at the season 's end , he was also awarded the Bill Hunter Trophy as the league 's best defenceman . Baumgartner 's NHL career got off to an uneven start due to a serious shoulder injury . After playing the majority of his tenure in Washington with the Capitals ' American Hockey League affiliate , the Portland Pirates , he was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks on July 20 , 2000 , for RÃ mi Royer . Baumgartner would continue to play in the AHL with Chicago 's minor league affiliate , the Norfolk Admirals . On July 11 , 2002 , he was signed as a free agent by the Vancouver Canucks . After one season with the Canucks , he was placed on waivers and picked up by the Pittsburgh Penguins on October 3 , 2003 .

An elementary school was built in the community in 1961 , and Anderson incorporated as a city in 1962 . In the 1960s , a road was completed between Anderson and Nenana , which gave access to Fairbanks . Vehicles were ferried across the Tanana River at Nenana until 1968 , when a steel bridge was built there .

The Chester city walls are a system of largely intact defensive walls surrounding the strategically important English city of Chester . The city has been defended with walls since the foundation of the Deva Victrix fort on the site in 79 . The current walls are mainly medieval and Victorian , although the earliest surviving sections date back to at least 120 , and the most recent section was constructed as recently as 1966 . The walls are a Grade I listed building , and are the most complete city walls in Great Britain . The first walls were wood and earth palisades built to defend the Roman fort in 79 , although these were replaced by stronger stone walls between the 1st and 3rd century . The walls enclosed a far smaller area than the modern walls , with the south-western corner much further from the River Dee . With the Roman departure from Britain the walls fell into disrepair until 907 , when Queen Ã thelflÃ d ordered the fortification of the city in response to the Viking settlement of the nearby Wirral Peninsula . Following the construction of Chester Castle in 1070 , the walls were extended south-west towards the river , with a short spur off the north-west corner to defend the Roodee , at the time a valuable shipping port . During the English Civil War , Chester was a Royalist stronghold and was heavily besieged . Charles I of England intended to break the siege with a concentrated attack , allowing Irish allies access to the port . However , Charles I watched from the Phoenix Tower ( King Charles ' Tower ) , part of the city walls , as his forces were defeated in the Battle of Rowton Heath . Charles I fled and the city was completely circumvallated and contravallated by the Parliamentarians . The siege engines and cannons used by the Parliamentarians caused great damage to the walls , with many sections completely breached . As a result , the wall was almost impassable , so the walls were much repaired and renovated during the Georgian era . The walls became a popular promenade , with many of the towers and gatehouses removed or adapted to allow free movement along the entire circuit of the walls . The Victorians further adapted the walls , with the original medieval gates being removed and replaced with wider ornamental gates . The famous Eastgate Clock was added in 1899 , to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria . The most recent change to the walls was made in 1966 , when the St. Martin 's Gate was built to allow the A5268 , or Chester ring road , to pass through the city . The gate is a brutalist-modernist concrete footbridge between the Northgate and the Water Tower . The walls form an almost complete circuit 2 miles ( 3 km ) long ; the only breaks being for the entrance to the car park of the Cheshire West and Chester Council headquarters and the approach road to the Grosvenor Bridge . The walls are both a Grade I listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument Despite this protection , the local Conservatives have raised concerns about the state of the walls , claiming that damage due to vandalism and erosion of the walls is unsightly and poses a danger . However , Chester City Council , who were responsible for maintenance of the walls , rebutted these claims , stating that the walls were kept safe , and that the sandstone used to build the wall is especially prone to weathering . Following the collapse of a section of the wall on 3 April 2008 , a 30-metre section of the wall near the Grosvenor Hotel has been closed to the public while repairs are planned . A famous archaic bye-law of Chester states that any Welshman loitering within the city walls after sunset may be killed by decapitation or shot with a longbow . The law was originally imposed by King Henry V following the Welsh Revolt . This order was never repealed , and still officially stands on the statute to this day , although it no longer provides protection against prosecution for murder .
The Apiales are an order of flowering plants . The families given at right are those recognized in the APG III system . This is typical of the newer classifications , though there is some slight variation , and in particular the Torriceliaceae may be divided . Under this definition well-known members include carrots , celery , parsley , and ivy . The order Apiales is placed within the asterid group of eudicots as circumscribed by the APG III system . Within the asterids , Apiales belongs to an unranked group called the campanulids , and within the campanulids , it belongs to a clade that is known in phylogenetic nomenclature as Apiidae . In 2010 , a subclade of Apiidae was named Dipsapiidae and was defined to consist of the three orders Apiales Paracryphiales , and Dipsacales . The circumscriptions of some of the families have changed . In 2009 , it was shown that one of the subfamilies of Araliaceae was polyphyletic . The present understanding of the Apiales is fairly recent and is based upon comparison of DNA sequences by phylogenetic methods . Under the Cronquist system , only the Apiaceae and Araliaceae were included here , and the restricted order was placed among the rosids rather than the asterids . The Pittosporaceae were placed within the Rosales , and many of the other forms within the family Cornaceae . Pennantia was in the family Icacinaceae .
This template expands its parameter to link to the appropriate railway station article , without displaying `` railway station '' . For example , expands to . Discretion should be used on whether to name the place itself or the station that serves it . In railway articles it is generally preferred to use the station unless specifically talking about the place , for example that serves the city of Peterborough . Almost all British stations follow the link form of terminating with `` railway station '' .
Roberto Rivellino ( born 1 January 1946 in SÃ # o Paulo ) is a former Brazilian football player . The son of Italian immigrants from Macchiagodena ( Isernia ) , he was famous for his large moustache , thunderous long-range free kicks , excellent long passes , quick thinking and distinct way of controlling the ball . He also invented a football move called the `` flip flap '' , famously copied by Ronaldinho , Zlatan IbrahimoviÄ and Cristiano Ronaldo in recent years . He is widely regarded as one of the most graceful football players ever , and among the best midfielders of his generation . Rivelino started as a futsal player at Clube Atletico Barcelona . After that , he tried his luck with Barcelona 's biggest rival in futsal , Corinthians , where he moved on to professional football and quickly became a favorite of the fans -- and was therefore nicknamed `` O Rei do Parque '' ( King of the Park ) ( after the club 's home ground , Parque SÃ # o Jorge ) . However , the late 60s and early 70s were one of the most troubled periods in the history of the club , which did not win a single SÃ # o Paulo state league title from 1954 to 1977 . In 1974 , after Corinthians was defeated by arch-rivals Palmeiras in the SÃ # o Paulo league finals , Rivelino was singled out by most fans as one of the main responsible . He moved on to Rio de Janeiro , where he defended Fluminense until the end of the 70s . Rivelino was undoubtedly the greatest star in the excellent Fluminense of the mid 70s , dubbed `` the tricolor machine '' , among Doval , Pintinho , Gil and Carlos Alberto Torres . He won the Rio de Janeiro league championship in 1975 and 1976 . By the end of the decade , he moved on to play for Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia ; he retired from professional football in 1981 . Rivelino is one of the players who had more than 100 caps for the Brazilian national team . He was a starter in most games in the successful Brazilian campaign in the 1970 FIFA World Cup , scoring 3 goals , including the powerful free-kick against Czechoslovakia , which earned him the nickname `` Patada AtÃ mica '' ( Atomic Kick ) by Mexican fans . Rivelino also played in the 1974 and 1978 FIFA World Cups , though with less success ( 4th and 3rd places respectively ) . After his professional retirement , Rivelino started a career as a football commentator and coach ( he has managed Shimizu S-Pulse in J. League ) . Rivelino further represented Brazil in the 1989 edition of the World Cup of Masters , scoring in the final against Uruguay . Rivelino was one of the players named by PelÃ in 2004 as the 125 Greatest Living Footballers . Rivelino is sometimes credited with scoring the fastest goal in football history when he supposedly scored a goal direct from the kick-off after noticing the opposition goalkeeper on his knees finishing off pre-match prayers . Rivelino is the name of an amateur football team based in Fulham , London , UK , and who play in the Wimbledon and District League . Named after the South American footballer and playing in the yellow and blue of Brazil , Rivelino 's club motto is to `` live the dream '' .

Richard Bache ( 1737 â `` 1811 ) , born in Yorkshire , England , was the son-in-law of Benjamin Franklin . After arriving in Philadelphia from Yorkshire , England , in 1761 , Bache prospered as a marine insurance underwriter and importer . In 1767 , misfortune struck ; debts contracted by him were repudiated by his London associate , Edward Green . Because of his impecunious state and reputation as a fortune hunter , Franklin objected to Bache 's proposal to marry his daughter , Sarah . Although Franklin never formally approved , he acquiesced to the marriage in 1767 , and afterward he installed Bache as head of the American Post Office . Bache quit the post a few years after Franklin 's death ( 1790 ) and lived off Franklin 's inheritance on a country estate . Bache also served on the Board of War . His wife , Sarah Bache ( 1743 â `` 1808 ) , was widely known for patriotism and benevolent activities . Their son , Richard Bache Jr. , served in the Republic of Texas Navy and was elected as a Representative to the Second Texas Legislature in 1847 . Another son was Benjamin Franklin Bache ( 1769 â `` 1798 ) , a major journalist and spokesman for the Jeffersonian Republicans ; he strenuously opposed George Washington , John Adams and the Federalist party . U.S. Navy surgeon Benjamin Franklin Bache ( 1801 â `` 1881 ) and the physicist Alexander Dallas Bache ( 1806 â `` 1867 ) were grandsons of Richard Bache Sr. ( and thus great-grandsons of Benjamin Franklin ) .
The President of the Confederation is the presiding member of the seven-member Swiss Federal Council , Switzerland 's executive . Elected by the Federal Assembly for one year , the President of the Confederation chairs the meetings of the Federal Council and undertakes special representational duties . Primus inter pares , the President has no powers above the other Councillors and continues to head her department . Traditionally the duty rotates among the members in order of seniority and the previous year 's Vice President becomes President . As first among equals , the Federal Council member serving as President of the Confederation is not considered the Swiss head of State . Rather , the entire Federal Council is considered a collective Head of State . The constitutional provisions relating to the organization of the Federal Government and Federal Administration are set out in section 1 of Chapter 3 of the Swiss Federal Constitution at articles 174 to 179 . Article 176 specifically relates to the Presidency . The Swiss President is not â `` as are , for example , the Presidents in Austria or Germany â `` the Head of State of the country : the Swiss Federal Constitution knows neither a Head of State nor a Head of Government . Both of these functions are administered by the Federal Council collectively . If a tied vote occurs in the council ( which does not happen too often , the number of Federal Councellors being an odd number ) , the President , being its Chair , casts the deciding vote . In addition to the control of his or her own Department , the President carries out some of the representative duties of a Head of State . At first this was only the case inside Switzerland , where the President gave speeches on the New Year and the Swiss National Holiday ( 1 August ) . More recently , added foreign visits means that the President also often travels abroad . However , because the Swiss have no single Head of State , the country also carries out no state visits . When traveling abroad , the President does so only as an ordinary Minister of a government Department . Visiting heads of state are received by the seven members of the Federal Council together , rather than by the President of the Confederation . Treaties are signed on behalf of the full Council , with all Federal Council members signing letters of credence and other documents of the kind . The President is elected by the Federal Assembly from the Federal Council in each case for one year . In the 19th century , the election of the Federal President was an award for especially esteemed Federal Council members . However , a few influential members of the government were regularly passed over . One such example was Wilhelm Matthias Naeff , who belonged to the government for twenty-seven years , but was Federal President only once in 1853 . Since the twentieth century , the election has usually not been disputed . There is an unwritten rule that the member of the Federal Council who has not been Federal President the longest becomes President . Therefore every Federal Council member gets a turn at least once every seven years . The only question in the elections that provides some tension is the question of how many votes the person who is to be elected President receives . This is seen as a popularity test . In the 1970s and 1980s , 200 votes ( of 246 possible ) was seen as an excellent result , but in the current era of growing party-political conflicts , 180 votes are a respectable outcome . Until 1920 , it was customary for the serving Federal President to also lead the Foreign Ministry . Therefore every year there was a moving around of posts , as the retiring President returned to his former department and the new president moved into the Foreign Ministry . Likewise , it was traditional for the Federal President , even as Foreign Minister , not to leave Switzerland during his year in office . On Dec 8th , 2010 , Micheline Calmy-Rey was elected to replace Doris Leuthard as President of the Confederation for the 2011 term .

Buto ( , , BoutÅ ) , Butus ( , Boutos ) , or Butosus , , Now Desouk , was an ancient city located 95 km east of Alexandria in the Nile Delta of Egypt . The city stood on the Sebennytic arm of the Nile , near its mouth , and on the southern shore of the Butic Lake ( , BoutikÄ `` limnÄ `` ) . It is the modern Kem Kasir . Buto originally was two cities , Pe and Dep , which merged into one city that the Egyptians named Per-Wadjet . The goddess Wadjet was its local goddess , often represented as a cobra , and she was considered the patron deity of Lower Egypt . Her oracle was located in her renowned temple in that city . An annual festival held in the city celebrated Wadjet . Her image formed the royal crown , the Uraeus , worn by the rulers of Lower Egypt . It encircled their heads and the cobra flare and head extended from their foreheads . Wadjet was closely associated in the Egyptian pantheon with Bast the fierce goddess depicted as a lioness warrior and protector , a sun goddess whose eye later became the eye of Horus or the eye of Ra , the Lady of Flame . The city also contained a sanctuary of Horus and much later , became associated with Isis . The city was an important site in the Predynastic era of Ancient Egypt that includes the cultural developments of ten thousand years from the Paleolithic to 3100 BC . Archaeological evidence shows that Upper Egyptian culture replaced the Buto-culture at the delta when Upper and Lower Egypt were unified , and the replacement is considered important evidence for the unification of the two portions of Egypt into one entity . At that time Wadjet joined Nekhbet , who was represented as a white vulture and held the same position as the patron of Upper Egypt , and together they were known as the two ladies ( 4 ) who were the patrons of the unified Egypt . The image of Nekhbet joined Wadjet on the Uraeus that would encircle the crown of the pharaohs who ruled the unified Egypt . Being called Buto by the Greeks during Ptolemaic Egypt , a Greek dynasty ruling from 305 to 30 BC , it was the capital town , or according to Herodian , merely the principal village of the Nile Delta , which Herodotus ( l. c. ) calls the Chemmite nome ; Ptolemy , the Phthenothite nome ( , iv . 5 . Â 48 ) , and Pliny the Elder , ( v. 9 . s. 11 ) , Ptenetha . The Greek historians record that the town was celebrated for its monolithite temple and oracle of the goddess Wadjet ( Buto ) ( Herod . ii . V. Hist . ii . A yearly feast was held there in honor of the goddess . They noted that at Buto there was also a sanctuary of Horus ( associated by the ancient Greeks with Apollo ) and of Bastet ( associated with Artemis ) . ( Champollion , l'Egypte , vol . ii . p. 227 . ) In Egyptian mythology , Bast ( also spelled Bastet , Baset , Ubasti , and Pasht ) is an ancient goddess , worshipped at least since the Second dynasty of Egypt , which is dated 2890 to 2690 BC . The center of her cult was in Per-Bast ( Bubastis in Greek ) , which was named after her . Originally she was viewed as the protector goddess of Lower Egypt , and consequently depicted as a fierce lioness . Indeed , her name means devourer . As protector , she was seen as defender of the pharaoh ( and consequently of the later chief god , Ra ) , who was a solar deity , gaining her the titles Lady of Flame and Eye of Ra . Bast was originally a sun goddess , but later changed by the Greeks to a goddess of the moon . In Greek mythology , Bast is also known as Aelurus . The Greek name , Buto , is nearly allied to that of Muth or Maut , their appellations for Isis , as Mother of the World . ( Plut . Is . et Osir . 18 , 38 . ) According to these same late sources , the shrew was worshipped at Buto . ( Herod . ii . 67 . )
The United Center is an indoor sports arena located in the Near West Side community area of Chicago . It is named after its corporate sponsor , United Airlines . The United Center is home to both the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League and the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association . The plan to build the arena was created by the late Bill Wirtz and Jerry Reinsdorf , the owners of the two sports teams , respectively . The United Center 's predecessor was the indoor Chicago Stadium , the original `` Madhouse on Madison '' , which was demolished after the newer arena opened for business on August 18 , 1994 . A statue of Michael Jordan , `` The Spirit '' , is located on the east side of the arena , while a statue of various Blackhawks sits to the north on Madison Street , where the Chicago Stadium was located . United Airlines pays about $ 1.8 million per year until 2014 for its naming rights . The United Center , which is currently owned by Rocky Wirtz and Reinsdorf , covers 960,000 square feet ( 89,187 mÂ ) and is located on a 46-acre ( 19 ha ) parcel , west of the Chicago Loop . The arena is the largest in the United States in physical size , though not in capacity . Its exterior bears a striking resemblance to that of Chicago Stadium . It seats 19,717 ( not including standing room ) for hockey ( highest attendance at a Blackhawks game in 2010 was 22,428 vs. Detroit ) , 20,917 ( not including standing room ) for basketball ( highest attendance at a Bulls game in 2010 was 23,129 vs. Cleveland ) and up to 23,500 for concerts . The United Center hosts over 200 events per year and has drawn over 20 million visitors since its opening . It is known for routinely meeting and exceeding seating capacity for Bulls and Blackhawks games . United Center 's acoustics were designed to amplify the noise level in order to recreate `` The Roar '' -- the din of noise that made Chicago Stadium famous , especially during hockey games . During hockey season , an Allen Organ that is a replica of the old arena 's famous Barton organ is used ; recreating the old organ 's notes took two years . As of the 2009 renovation , the stadium has 169 executive suites on three levels . In addition to more than 80 Bulls\/Blackhawks games each year , the United Center has hosted other sporting events such as University of Illinois basketball , the Big Ten Men 's Basketball Tournament ( from the first tournament in 1998 to 2001 , then in odd numbered years from 2003 to 2007 , before the tournament moved permanently to Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis ) , the Men 's NCAA Basketball Tournament ( hosted four times , including 2011 ) , the Roundball Classic , and the Great Eight Classic . U2 filmed two concerts during the American Leg of their Vertigo Tour for the concert film , Vertigo 2005 : Live from Chicago . The Dave Matthews Band released Live in Chicago 12.19.98 , as live album and a bootleg video of the webcast of the performance is widely in circulation among DMB fans . The United Center has also provided a Chicago home for Cirque du Soleil , Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus and Disney on Ice . The arena was the Bulls ' home during their second run of three consecutive championships , hosting the , , and 1998 NBA Finals . The Bulls won the 1996 and 1997 series in the sixth game at home , but won the 1998 series at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City , which is now known as the EnergySolutions Arena . The United Center was also the site of the World Wrestling Federation pay-per-view SummerSlam in 1994 â '' the first major event held inside the building . It also hosted the last of World Championship Wrestling 's annual Spring Stampede pay-per-views in 2000 . The United Center was also the site of the 1996 Democratic National Convention . The Stanley Cup Finals were played in the arena for the first time in . However , the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup at Wachovia Center , now Wells Fargo Center , in Philadelphia . On the weekend of March 5-6 , 2011 , the Professional Bull Riders made their Built Ford Tough Series debut at the United Center . It was their third Chicago-area visit , having previously visited Rosemont 's Allstate Arena in 2006 and 2008 . The event at the United Center presented a unique scenario in that instead of dirt , white stone was used to cover the arena floor . The Blackhawks announced that hockey legends Bobby Hull and Stan Mikita would receive bronze statues in their honor outside of the United Center during the 2011-2012 NHL season . The Illinois State High School Hockey Championships are hosted at the United Center yearly for the Blackhawk Cup .

The British Rail Class 414 ( or 2Hap ) electric multiple units were built between 1956 and 1963 . 209 of these two car units were built to two similar sub-classes . The first batch of thirty-six units were built on the underframes of older SR Class 2Nol units , and numbered in the range 5601-5636 . These were followed by 173 new-build units , numbered in the range 6001-6173 . The class 414 started to be withdrawn in 1982 because of a large number of them containing blue asbestos . In 1983 , ten Driving Motor Cars were converted for use on the Gatwick Express service in conjunction with Class 73 locomotives and Class 488 unpowered EMU trailers . These units were reclassified as Class 489 .

PackageKit is an open source and free suite of software applications designed to provide a consistent and high-level front end for a number of different package management systems . PackageKit was created by Richard Hughes . The suite is ostensibly cross-platform , though it is primarily targeted at Linux distributions which follow the interoperability standards set out by the freedesktop.org group . It uses the software libraries provided by the D-Bus and PolicyKit projects to handle inter-process communication and computer privilege negotiation . PackageKit was created by Richard Hughes and first proposed in a series of blog posts in 2007 , and is now developed by a small team of developers . Fedora 9 was the first operating system to use it as default front end for yum . It has undergone many updates in Fedora 10 and Fedora 11 . PackageKit itself is a system activated daemon called , that abstracts out differences between the different systems . A library called libpackagekit also allows other programs to interact with PackageKit . A number of different package management systems ( known as back-ends ) support different abstract methods and signals that are used by the front-end tools . Back-ends supported include :
VatnajÃ kull is the largest glacier in Iceland . It is located in the south-east of the island , covering more than 8 % of the country . With an area of 8,100 kmÂ , VatnajÃ kull is the largest ice cap in Europe by volume ( 3,100 kmÂ ) and the second largest ( after Austfonna on Nordaustlandet , Svalbard ) in area ( not counting the still larger Severny Island ice cap of Novaya Zemlya , Russia , which may be regarded as located in the extreme northeast of Europe ) . On 7 June 2008 , it became a part of the VatnajÃ kull National Park . The average thickness of the ice is thus 400 m , with a maximum thickness of 1,000 m. Iceland 's highest peak , HvannadalshnÃ kur ( 2,109.6 m ) , is located in the southern periphery of VatnajÃ kull , near Skaftafell National Park . Under the ice cap , as under many of the glaciers of Iceland , there are several volcanoes . The volcanic lakes , GrÃ msvÃ tn for example , were the sources of a large jÃ kulhlaup ( glacial lake outburst flood ) in 1996 . There was also a considerable but short-time eruption of the volcano under these lakes at the beginning of November 2004 . During the last ice age , numerous volcanic eruptions occurred under VatnajÃ kull , creating many subglacial eruptions . These eruptions formed tuyas , such as HerÃ ubreiÃ which was beneath VatnajÃ kull during the last ice age . According to Guinness World Records , VatnajÃ kull is the object of the world 's longest sight line , 550 km from SlÃ ttaratindur , the highest mountain in the Faroe Islands . GWR state that `` owing to the light bending effects of atmospheric refraction , VatnajÃ kull ( 2,109.6 m ) , Iceland , can sometimes be seen from the Faroe Islands , 340 miles ( 550km ) away '' . This may be based on a claimed sighting by a British sailor in 1939 . The validity of this record is analysed\/undermined in mathematical and atmospheric detail by J.C. Ferranti . In 1950 , a Douglas DC-4 operated by the private airline LoftleiÃ ir crash-landed on the VatnajÃ kull glacier and never flew again . Its abandoned fuselage is visible in the 2007 film Heima , a documentary about a tour performed by the band Sigur RÃ s. The glacier was used as the setting for the opening sequence ( actually set in Siberia ) of the 1985 James Bond film A View to a Kill , in which Bond ( played for the last time by Roger Moore ) eliminated a host of armed villains before escaping in a submarine to Alaska . Several other films , including another in the Bond franchise , have been filmed on or using JÃ kulsÃ rlÃ n , the terminal lake of the BreiÃ amerkurjÃ kull outlet from VatnajÃ kull .

New Year 's Revolution was a professional wrestling pay-per-view ( PPV ) event , that was produced every January by the American professional wrestling promotion , World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) . The event was created in 2005 , with its inaugural event produced in January of that year . To coincide with the brand extension , the event was made exclusive to the Raw brand throughout the event 's history . Since its inception in 2005 , the event has been held in one country : the United States . It has been held in two U.S. states and once in Puerto Rico , where every event has been held in an indoor arena . Each event featured professional wrestlers from WWE competing in various professional wrestling match types . Since the inaugural event , three championship matches have taken place in the main event . New Year 's Revolution was removed from the WWE schedule when they reduced the number of PPVs per year . New Year 's Revolution was a pay-per-view ( PPV ) event consisting of a main event and undercard that featured championship matches and other various bouts . The first New Year 's Revolution took place on January 9 , 2005 and aired live on PPV . The main event was an Elimination Chamber match , a special professional wrestling match type promoted on rare occasions in WWE . The Elimination Chamber is 16-feet-high and weighs 10-tons . It is composed of two miles of chain , steel grating , and plexiglas pods ( which contain the individual wrestlers ) . The 2006 event also featured an Elimination Chamber match as the main event . In 2007 , however , the annual Elimination Chamber match was moved to December to Dismember and was made ECW-exclusive . After its 2007 return , the December to Dismember event was canceled , and the Elimination Chamber matches were moved once again to the No Way Out event . The New Year 's Revolution event was then canceled in 2008 . In 2002 , WWE held a draft that split its roster into two distinctive brands of wrestling , Raw and SmackDown , and ECW later in 2006 . Before the draft , matches featured wrestlers from the roster without any limitations ; after the draft , however , matches consisted only of wrestlers from their distinctive brands . The first New Year 's Revolution event which took place on January 9 , 2005 . New Year 's Revolution was exclusive to the Raw brand . After three years of being produced as a brand-exclusive event , New Year 's Revolution ( 2007 ) was the final New Year 's Revolution event . At the final New Year 's Revolution in 2007 , the main event was a singles match for the WWE Championship between John Cena and Umaga , which Cena won to retain the title . The 2005 event never reached Billboard.com 's top ten list for Recreational Sports DVDs . The first week the event appeared on the Billboard chart , it ranked 19th . The following week , the event ranked 17th , only to drop off the chart the next week . The 2006 event ranked third on its first week in the chart 's top ten list . The following week , the DVD reached second on the list , and remained in the top ten for five weeks until the week of April 8 , 2006 , when the event dropped to 11th . The 2007 event ranked second in its first week in the top ten . The DVD remained in the top ten for four weeks until the week of March 31 , 2007 , when it ranked 11th . Canadian Online Explorers professional wrestling section rated the 2005 event a three out of ten stars . The main event was rated a seven out of ten stars . The 2006 event was given a rating of three out of ten stars also , with the main event being rated six out of ten stars . The 2007 event was rated six out of ten stars , the highest a New Year 's Revolution event has been rated . The main event was given a six out of ten stars rating , the same as the previous year 's main event .
Selenium disulfide is an inorganic compound with the approximate formula SeS2 . Both sulfur and selenium catenate ( form chains and rings ) readily , and mixtures of selenium and sulfur likewise give rise to numerous `` alloys '' . This compound is not an analog of sulfur dioxide . The material commercially called selenium disulfide is sold as an antifungal agent in shampoos for the treatment of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis associated in the scalp with Malassezia genus fungi . In the United States , a 1 % strength is available over-the-counter , and a 2.5 % strength is also available with a prescription . At the 2.5 % strength , selenium disulfide is also used on the body to treat tinea versicolor , a type of fungal skin infection caused by a different species of Malassezia . Selenium disulfide has a composition that approximates to SeS2 and is sometimes called selenium sulfide . However , as used in proprietary formulations , it is not a pure chemical compound but is a mixture where the overall Se : S ratio is 1:2 . The compounds are cyclic Seâ `` S rings containing a variable number of S and Se atoms , SenS8 n. Selenium disulfide can cause discoloration of the hair and alter the color of hair dyes . It may also discolor metallic jewellery . Many selenium sulfides are known . A useful means for characterization is 77Se NMR spectroscopy . Chalcogen ring interconversion pathways . Selenium monosulfide ( SeS ) is the only selenium compound so far identified as a carcinogen in animals . Selenium monosulfide , along with elemental selenium and sulfur , has been used in medicinal preparations in the past , causing confusion and contradiction as to exactly what form selenium is in in any given topical preparation .
Oberhavel is a Kreis ( district ) in the northern part of Brandenburg , Germany . Neighboring districts are ( from north clockwise ) Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania , the districts Uckermark , Barnim , the Bundesland Berlin , and the districts Havelland and Ostprignitz-Ruppin . The district is located along the upper course of the Havel river from its source to the outskirts of Berlin . The north is characterised by many lakes including the GroÃ er Stechlinsee lake , which is well known due to a novel by Theodor Fontane called `` Der Stechlin '' . The district was created on December 6 1993 by merging the previous districts Gransee and Oranienburg . The district is home to three rugby union clubs , the RU Hohen Neuendorf , Veltener RC and Stahl Hennigsdorf Rugby . The later was the most successful rugby club in East Germany , winning 27 national championships from 1952 to 1990 .
Vladimir Igorevich Arnold ( alternative spelling Arnol 'd , , 12 June 1937 â `` 3 June 2010 ) was a Soviet and Russian mathematician . While he is best known for the Kolmogorovâ `` Arnoldâ `` Moser theorem regarding the stability of integrable Hamiltonian systems , he made important contributions in a number of areas including dynamical systems theory , catastrophe theory , topology , algebraic geometry , classical mechanics and singularity theory , including posing the ADE classification problem , since his first main resultâ '' the solution of Hilbert 's thirteenth problem in 1957 at the age of 19 . While a student of Andrey Kolmogorov at Moscow State University and still a teenager , Arnold showed in 1957 that any continuous function of several variables can be constructed with a finite number of two-variable functions , thereby solving Hilbert 's thirteenth problem . After graduating from Moscow State University in 1959 , he worked there until 1986 ( a professor since 1965 ) , and then at Steklov Mathematical Institute . He became an academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences ( Russian Academy of Science since 1991 ) in 1990 . Arnold can be said to have initiated the theory of symplectic topology as a distinct discipline . The Arnold conjecture on the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms and Lagrangian intersections were also a major motivation in the development of Floer homology . Arnold worked at the Steklov Mathematical Institute in Moscow and at Paris Dauphine University up until his death . As of 2006 he was reported to have the highest citation index among Russian scientists , and h-index of 40 . To his students and colleagues Arnold was known also for his sense of humor . For example , once at his seminar in Moscow , at the beginning of the school year , when he usually was formulating new problems , he said : There is a general principle that a stupid man can ask such questions to which one hundred wise men would not be able to answer . In accordance with this principle I shall formulate some problems . Arnold died of peritonitis on 3 June 2010 in Paris , nine days before his 73rd birthday . His students include Alexander Givental , Victor Vassiliev and Askold Khovanskii . Arnold is well known for his lucid writing style , combining mathematical rigor with physical intuition , and an easy conversational style of teaching . His writings present a fresh , often geometric approach to traditional mathematical topics like ordinary differential equations , and his many textbooks have proved influential in the development of new areas of mathematics . However , Arnold 's books have been criticized for supporting the theory with statements meant to teach an intuitive understanding , without providing the tools necessary to prove these statements . Arnold was an outspoken critic of the trend of high levels of abstraction in mathematics during the middle of the last century . He had very strong opinions on how this approachâ '' which was most popularly implemented by the Bourbaki school in Franceâ '' initially had a negative impact on French , and then later other countries ' , mathematical education . Arnold 's sharp critique of Bourbaki approach was in turn criticized by other mathematicians . Arnold has been the recipient of many awards , such as the Lenin Prize ( 1965 , with Andrey Kolmogorov ) , the Crafoord Prize ( 1982 , with Louis Nirenberg ) , the Harvey prize ( 1994 ) , Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics ( 2001 ) , the Wolf Prize in Mathematics ( 2001 ) and the State Prize of the Russian Federation ( 2007 ) . He was awarded the Shaw Prize in mathematical sciences in 2008 . The minor planet 10031 Vladarnolda was named after him in 1981 by Lyudmila Georgievna Karachkina .
The British Rail Class 332 is the type of electric multiple unit train used on the Heathrow Express between London Paddington station and Heathrow Airport . The fleet was built in 1997-1998 by Siemens and CAF at the latterâ s factory in Zaragoza , Spain . There are 14 four\/five carriage units . The units are equipped with Automatic Train Protection ( ATP ) , one of the few in the UK to do so . This is largely as a consequence of the Paddington-Heathrow route operating ( for the most part ) on the Great Western Main Line , which had been equipped with ATP in the early 1990s as part of an experimental trial of the system by British Rail . The Class 332 units were the first electric trains to operate over the Great Western Main Line out of Paddington when the line was electrified as far as Airport Junction . Initially , all 14 units were constructed as four-car sets but , in 2002 , five units were lengthened to five cars , allowing trains of up to nine car length to be operated . The service frequency between London Paddington and Heathrow Airport , Terminal Five is four trains per an hour ( 4 TPH ) , which is one every 15 minutes . The Class 332 can either work on their own or in pairs when in service . The units are divided into first class and standard class accommodation - the four car sets can accommodate up to 175 standard class passengers , with up to 239 accommodated in the five car sets . First class accommodation is located in one of the driving cars - these have two different layouts , with 332002 and 332004 , together with all of the five car sets able to accommodate up to 26 first class passengers , while in the rest of the four car sets up to 14 first class passengers can be accommodated . This is due to the amount of bonded luggage space provided for first class passengers in different units . One driving car in each set is usually given an all-over advertising livery ; currently RBS is providing this advertising , although their logo has started to be removed from some units in preparation for a new sponsor . Class 332 units are capable of working in multiple only with each other and with the related Class 333 units operated by Northern Rail .
Phosphorous acid is the compound described by the formula H3PO3 . This acid is diprotic ( readily ionizes two protons ) , not triprotic as might be suggested by this formula . Phosphorous acid is as an intermediate in the preparation of other phosphorus compounds . H3PO3 is more clearly described with the structural formula HPO ( OH ) 2 . This species exists in equilibrium with a minor tautomer P ( OH ) 3 . IUPAC recommendations , 2005 , are that the latter is called phosphorous acid , whereas the dihydroxy form is called phosphonic acid . Only the reduced phosphorus compounds are spelled with an `` ous '' ending . Other important oxyacids of phosphorus are phosphoric acid ( H3PO4 ) and hypophosphorous acid ( H3PO2 ) . The reduced phosphorus acids are subject to similar tautomerism involving shifts of H between O and P. The P ( OH ) 3 tautomer has been observed as a ligand bonded to molybdenum . In the solid state , HP ( O ) ( OH ) 2 is tetrahedral with one shorter P = O bond of 148 pm and two longer P-O ( H ) bonds of 154 pm . Because the electronegativity of H and P are similar , the covalent P-H bond does not alter oxidation state of phosphorus , which is assigned the formal oxidation state P ( II ) . : P4O6 + 6 H2O â ' 4 HPO ( OH ) 2 ( An analogous relationship connects H3PO4 and P4O10 ) . K2HPO3 + 2 HCl â ' 2 KCl + H3PO3 In practice aqueous potassium phosphite is treated with excess hydrochloric acid . By concentrating the solution and precipitations with alcohols , the pure acid can be separated from the salt . Phosphorous acid on heating at 200 Â C converts to phosphoric acid and phosphine : 4H3PO3 â ' 3H3PO4 + PH3 although in practice the reaction yields a number of brownish undefined phosphorus suboxides as well . Phosphorous acid is a moderately strong dibasic acid . It reacts with alkalis forming acid phosphites and normal phosphites . Thus , reaction with sodium hydroxide gives sodium dihydrogen phosphite and disodium hydrogen phosphite , but not trisodium phosphite , Na3PO3 as the third ( P-bound ) hydrogen is not acidic . H3PO3 + NaOH â ' NaH2PO3 + H2O H3PO3 + 2NaOH â ' Na2HPO3 + 2H2O Phosphorous acid is a powerful reducing agent . When treated with a cold solution of mercuric chloride , a white precipitate of mercurous chloride forms : Phosphorous acid is a diprotic acid , since the hydrogen bonded directly to the central phosphorus atom is not readily ionizable . Chemistry examinations often test students ' appreciation of the fact that all three hydrogen atoms are not acidic under aqueous conditions , in contrast with phosphoric acid . HP ( O ) 2 ( OH ) â ' is a moderately strong acid . : HP ( O ) ( OH ) 2 â ' HP ( O ) 2 ( OH ) â ' + H + pKa = 1.3 : HP ( O ) 2 ( OH ) â ' â ' HPO32 â ' + H + pKa = 6.7 The HP ( O ) 2 ( OH ) â ' species is called the hydrogenphosphite , and the HPO32 â ' the phosphite ion . ( Note that the IUPAC recommendations are dihydrogenphosphite and hydrogenphosphite respectively ) The IUPAC ( mostly organic ) name is phosphonic acid . This nomenclature is commonly reserved for substituted derivatives , that is , organic group bonded to phosphorus , not simply an ester . For example , ( CH3 ) PO ( OH ) 2 is `` methylphosphonic acid '' , which may of course form `` methylphosphonate '' esters . Both phosphorous acid and its deprotonated forms are good reducing agents , although not necessarily quick to react . They are oxidized to phosphoric acid or its salts . It reduces solutions of noble metal cations to the metals . The most important use of phosphorous acid is the production of phosphonates which are used in water treatment . Phosphorous acid is also used for preparing phosphite salts , such as potassium phosphite . These salts , as well as aqueous solutions of pure phosphorous acid , have shown effectiveness in controlling a variety of microbial plant diseases , in particular , treatment using either trunk injection or foliar containing phosphorous acid salts is indicated in response to infections by phytophthora and pythium-type plant pathogens ( both within class oomycetes , known as water molds ) , such as dieback\/root rot and downy mildew . Anti-microbial products containing salts of phosphorous acid are marketed in Australia as ` Yates Anti-Rot ' ; and in the United States of America , for example , aluminum salts of the diethyl ester of phosphorous acid ( known generically as ` Fosetyl-Al ' ) are sold under the trade name ` Aliette ' . Phosphorous acid and its salts , unlike phosphoric acid , are somewhat toxic and should be handled carefully . Phosphorous acid is used in chemical reactions as a reducing agent that is somewhat less vigorous than the related hypophosphorous acid .
The 6th century is the period from 501 to 600 in accordance with the Julian calendar in the Christian\/Common Era . In the West this century marks the end of Classical Antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages . Following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire late in the previous century , Europe fractured into many small Germanic Kingdoms , which competed fiercely for land and wealth . From this upheaval the Franks rose to prominence , and carved out a sizeable domain encompassing much of modern France and Germany . Meanwhile , the surviving Eastern Roman Empire began to expand under the emperor Justinian , who eventually recaptured North Africa from the Vandals , and attempted to fully recover Italy as well in the hope of re-establishing Roman control over the lands once ruled by the Western Roman Empire . Following Justinian 's death , most of his gains were lost . During its second Golden Age , the Sassanid Empire reached the peak of its power under Khosrau I in the 6th century . The classical Gupta Empire of Northern India , largely overrun by the Huna , ended in the mid-6th century . In Japan , the Kofun period gave way to the Asuka period . After being divided for more than 150 years into the Southern and Northern Dynasties , China was reunited under the Sui Dynasty toward the end of the 6th century . The Three Kingdoms of Korea persisted throughout the 6th century . The GÃ ktÃ 1\/4 rks became a major power in Central Asia after defeating the Rouran . In the Americas , Teotihuacan began to decline in the 6th century after having reached its zenith between AD 150 and 450 . Classic Period of the Maya civilization in Central America .

Malabo is the capital and the second largest city of Equatorial Guinea , located on the northern coast of Bioko Island ( formerly Fernando PÃ ) on the rim of a sunken volcano . The city was first founded by the British in 1827 , who leased the island from Spain during the colonial period . Named Port Clarence , it was used as a naval station in the effort to suppress the slave trade . Many newly freed slaves were also settled there , prior to the establishment of Liberia as a colony for freed slaves . While many of them later relocated to Sierra Leone , some of their descendants , called Fernandinos , can still be found in Malabo and the surrounding area , where they constitute a distinct ethnic group , speaking their own Afro-Portuguese pidgin dialect . When the island reverted to complete Spanish control , Malabo was renamed Santa Isabel . It was chosen to replace the mainland town of Bata as the capital of the country in 1969 , and was renamed Malabo in 1973 as part of President Francisco MacÃ as Nguema 's campaign to replace European place names with `` authentic '' African ones . During his `` reign of terror , '' MacÃ as Nguema led a near-genocide of the country 's Bubi minority , which formed the majority on Bioko Island , and brought many of his own tribespeople , the Fang , to Malabo . In the final years of his rule , when Equatorial Guinea was sometimes known as the `` Auschwitz of Africa , '' much of the city 's population fled as , indeed , did about one-third of the country 's population . Malabo has yet to recover from the scars of that period . Despite its location near the equator , Malabo features a tropical wet and dry climate . Malabo sees on average 1,800 mm of rain per year . Malabo has a pronounced , albeit short dry season from December through February and a very lengthy wet season that covers the remaining nine months . Temperatures throughout the year are relatively constant in the city , averaging 25 Â C. Despite its status as the capital of Equatorial Guinea for several decades , Malabo 's street network remains poorly developed . Malabo itself has few paved roads leading into it , and fewer than one hundred paved and developed streets . Many of the street names reflect an African nationalist or anti-colonial theme , with names such as `` Independence Avenue '' or `` Patrice Lumumba Road '' being main roads . The few large roads not named for an African nationalist ideal or person are named for cities in Equatorial Guinea or other places or countries in Africa , as well as the road leading to the presidential palace . The palace and grounds consume a substantial part of the eastern side of Malabo , and are off-limits . The heart of the city is the colonial cathedral at Independence Place . Many buildings in the city from the Spanish colonial era are still standing . The south of Malabo is bordered by the Rio Consul . Across this lies the hospital to the southeast . To the west is the recently renovated Malabo Airport . The coastal northern region of the city is pierced by headlands and bays . The largest headland is the crescent-shaped Tip of African Unity behind the presidential palace . Encompassing the entire eastern side of Malabo Bay , it is almost as long as Malabo is tall . Malabo is part of a wider bay that represents most of the northern coast of Bioko ; it stretches from Europe Point in the west ( home to the airport ) , to barren lands in the east . Notable buildings in Malabo include Malabo Cathedral , Malabo Government Building and the Malabo Court Building . The city is served by Malabo International Airport , while ferries sail from its port to Douala and Bata . The city contains several notable hotels including Sofitel Malabo President Palace , Hotel Ureka , Hotel Bahia and Hotel Impala . Malabo has been significantly affected by Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo 's growing co-operation with the oil industry . The country 's production has reached 360000 o as of 2004 , an increase which led to a doubling of the city 's population , but for the vast majority , very little of that wealth has been invested in development . The Colegio Nacional Enrique NvÃ Okenve has campuses here and in Bata . Malabo International Airport serves Malabo . Several domestic and international carriers fly into Malabo .
`` Taco Grande '' is a parody of Gerardo 's song `` Rico Suave '' written by `` Weird Al '' Yankovic . It is about the narrator 's cravings for Mexican food and his visit to a fictional Mexican restaurant ( revealed to be the Enrique 's House of Salsa after translation ) . The song was recorded in 1992 and appears on Yankovic 's albums Off the Deep End and The Food Album . In 2007 , Disney hired Tim Buppert to re-record `` Taco Grande '' for the film Ratatouille .
Puslinch is a township in south-central Ontario , Canada , in the County of Wellington south of Guelph . The area is rich in natural gas resources . The main source of production is agricultural , bottling and mining . Mining has been dominant throughout the county . About half of the township is forested , and a conservation area lies to the southwest . Near the western edge of the township , just outside of Cambridge , Ontario is Puslinch Lake , the largest kettle lake in North America . The township was named after Puslinch House in Devon , England , where Elizabeth Yonge , the wife of Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada Sir John Colborne , was born . The township includes the communities of Aberfoyle , Aikensville , Arkell , Badenoch , Barbers Beach , Corwhin , Crieff , Killean , Little Lake , Morriston and Puslinch . Aberfoyle is the administrative center for Puslinch Township and is home to the municipality 's administrative offices and fire station . It is located at the headwaters of Mill Creek , approximately ten kilometres south of Guelph . Aberfoyle was first settled in the 1840s and is named for Aberfoyle , Scotland . It is famous for its spring water Aberfoyle Spring Water , which is bottled from Aberfoyle ( formerly Aberfoyle Spring Water Company ) . NestlÃ bought the company around 2002 . Other features include an elementary school ( Aberfoyle Public School ) and the Aberfoyle Mill , a popular restaurant . Arkell has a long relationship with beer brewing . Arkell was founded in 1830 by John Arkell , an Englishman who returned to the UK and founded Arkell 's Brewery . Just north and east of the village runs the Arkell Spring Aquifer , renowned for its fresh spring water which has brought many beverage companies to the area , including Sleeman Breweries , Wellington Breweries , and F & M Breweries . Wellington Breweries named one of their most popular beers Arkell Best Bitter in honor of the prized water they use in their brewing . The Arkell Springs also provide much of the municipal water for the city of Guelph . Arkell is a popular stopping point for cyclists and hikers to take a break when touring the country-side roads the surrounding city of Guelph , or the popular trails the Starkey Hill loop just east of the village , or the Arkell Springs trail which stretches along the Eramosa River from Watson Rd . . It is home to many beautiful houses , and picturesque settings . Just north of Arkell , east to nearby Eden Mills near the Eden Mills outdoor education center and south-east to Arkell Rd . at the Nassagaweya-Puslinch Townline Rd . intersection , opened in 1974 by the Guelph Hiking Club .
Erick Lee Purkhiser ( October 21 , 1946 â `` February 4 , 2009 ) , better known as Lux Interior , was an American singer and a founding member of the legendary garage punk band The Cramps from 1976 until his sudden death in February 2009 aged 62 . Born in Akron , Ohio , he grew up in its nearby suburb of Stow and graduated from Stow High School . He met his wife Kristy Wallace , better known as Poison Ivy , a.k.a. Ivy Rorschach , in Sacramento in 1972 , when he and a friend picked her up when she was hitchhiking . The couple founded the band and moved from California to Ohio in 1973 and then to New York in 1975 where they became part of the flourishing punk scene . Lux Interior 's name came `` from an old car commercial '' , having previously flirted with the names Vip Vop and Raven Beauty , while his wife 's name change was inspired by `` a vision she received in a dream '' . The couple called their musical style psychobilly , originally claiming it to have been inspired by a Johnny Cash song , ( One Piece at a Time ) , and later saying that they were just using the phrase as `` carny terms to drum up business . '' Interior was also a visual artist , in particular he was a 3D camera collector and enthusiast with which he created artworks and collages . The Cramps gave their last show in November 2006 . When asked why he continued to play live well into his middle age , he told the LA Times : `` It 's a little bit like asking a junkie how he 's been able to keep on dope all these years , It 's just so much fun . You pull in to one town and people scream , ' I love you , I love you , I love you . ' And you go to a bar and have a great rock 'n' roll show and go to the next town and people scream , ' I love you , I love you , I love you , I love you . ' It 's hard to walk away from all that . '' In 2002 Lux Interior performed the voice of a character on SpongeBob SquarePants - the lead singer of an all-bird rock band called the Bird Brains . SpongeBob voice Tom Kenny attended his memorial ceremony . Lux Interior died at 4:30 a.m. on February 4 , 2009 , in Glendale , California . The cause of death was aortic dissection . He is survived by his wife Ivy and two brothers , Michael Purkhiser and Ronald `` Skip '' Purkhiser . The memorial service for Lux was held on February 21st at the Windmill Chapel of the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine . This was a very private ceremony but a report of it , agreed to by Ivy , was posted for fans by long time friend Jonny Whiteside on the blog of LA Weekly and later in the print edition . Lux 's brother , Mike , also provided insight into his relationship with Lux in a newspaper article .
An emission nebula is a cloud of ionized gas emitting light of various colors . The most common source of ionization is high-energy photons emitted from a nearby hot star . Among the several different types of emission nebulae are H II regions , in which star formation is taking place and young , massive stars are the source of the ionizing photons ; and planetary nebulae , in which a dying star has thrown off its outer layers , with the exposed hot core then ionizing them . Usually , a young star will ionize part of the same cloud from which it was born although only massive , hot stars can release sufficient energy to ionize a significant part of a cloud . In many emission nebulae , an entire cluster of young stars is doing the work . The nebula 's color depends on its chemical composition and degree of ionization . Due to the prevalence of hydrogen in interstellar gas , and its relatively low energy of ionization , many emission nebulae appear red due to the strong emissions of the Balmer series . If more energy is available , other elements will be ionized and green and blue nebulae become possible . By examining the spectra of nebulae , astronomers deduce their chemical content . Most emission nebulae are about 90 % hydrogen , with the remainder helium , oxygen , nitrogen , and other elements . Some of the most prominent emission nebulae visible from the northern hemisphere are the North America Nebula ( NGC 7000 ) and Veil Nebula NGC 6960\/6992 in Cygnus , while in the south celestial hemisphere , the Lagoon Nebula M8 \/ NGC 6523 in Sagittarius and the Orion Nebula M42 . Further in the southern hemisphere is the bright Carina Nebula NGC 3372 . Emission nebulae often have dark areas in them which result from clouds of dust which block the light . The combination of emission nebula and dust cloud make for some beautiful objects , and many of these nebulae bear the name of objects that they early astronomers thought they resembled , such as the North America Nebula or the Cone Nebula . Many nebulae are made up of both reflection and emission components such as the Trifid Nebula .
Abernathyite is a rare hydrous uranium oxide mineral with chemical formula K2 ( UO2 ) 2 ( AsO4 ) 2 Â 6H2O . It occurs as a secondary fracture filling mineral . It crystallizes in the tetragonal system and forms yellow vitreous tabular crystals with perfect cleavage . It has a specific gravity of 3.3 and a hardness of 2.5 . It was first reported from a Colorado Plateau-type uranium deposit near Moab , Utah . It is named after mine operator Jess Abernathy .

Cape Hatteras is a cape on the coast of North Carolina . It is the point that protrudes the farthest to the southeast along the northeast-to-southwest line of the Atlantic coast of North America . Two major Atlantic currents collide just off Cape Hatteras , the southerly-flowing cold water Labrador Current and the northerly-flowing warm water Florida Current ( Gulf Stream ) , creating turbulent waters and a large expanse of shallow sandbars extending up to 14 m offshore . These shoals are known as Diamond Shoals . Because mariners utilize ocean currents to speed their journey , many ships venture close to Cape Hatteras when traveling along the eastern seaboard , risking the perils of sailing close to the shoals amid turbulent water and the frequent storms occurring in the area . So many ships have been lost off Cape Hatteras that the area is known as the `` Graveyard of the Atlantic '' . The cape is actually a bend in Hatteras Island , one of the long thin barrier islands that make up the Outer Banks . The first lighthouse at the cape was built in 1803 ; it was replaced by the current Cape Hatteras Lighthouse in 1870 , which at 198.48 f from the ground to the tip of its lightning rod is the tallest lighthouse in the United States and one of the tallest brick lighthouses in the world . In 1999 , as the receding shoreline had come dangerously close to Cape Hatteras Lighthouse , the 4830-ton lighthouse was lifted and moved inland a distance of 2900 f. Its distance from the seashore is now 1500 f , about the same as when it was originally built . Somewhat analogous to Point Conception in Southern California , this on-the-edge placement at the confluence of the Labrador and Florida currents leads to unusually diverse biological assemblages . Many species ' ranges have either a southern or northern terminus at the cape . Cape Hatteras is also infamous for being frequently struck by hurricanes that move up the East Coast of the United States . The strike of Hurricane Isabel in 2003 was particularly devastating for the area . Isabel devastated the entire Outer Banks and also split Hatteras Island between the two small towns of Frisco and Hatteras . NC 12 , which provides a direct route from Nags Head to Hatteras Island , was washed out when the hurricane created a new inlet . Students had to use a ferry to get to school . The inlet was filled in with sand by the Army Corps of Engineers which took nearly two months to complete . The road , electrical and water lines were quickly rebuilt when the inlet was filled . The name Hatteras is the sixth oldest surviving English place-name in the U.S. . An inlet north of the cape was named `` Hatrask '' in 1585 by Sir Richard Grenville , the admiral leading the Roanoke Colony expedition sent by Sir Walter Raleigh . It was later applied to the island and cape as well , and modified to `` Hatteras '' . Cape Hatteras displays a humid subtropical climate ( KÃ ppen Cfa ) , with mild winters , and very warm and humid summers . Its location , jutting out into the Atlantic , helps moderate conditions throughout the year , produces small diurnal temperature ranges . The warmest days in July and August average 86 F , and there are only 6 days per summer above 90 F. The median freeze dates are March 16 and December 7 . Snowfall is observed occasionally and most years do not see any accumulation . Rainfall is well-distributed throughout the years but is greatest in the latter half of summer , when hurricanes or their remnants can pass through .
Andrew is a city in Jackson County , Iowa , United States . The population was 460 at the 2000 census . Andrew , located in Jackson County , was named for Andrew Jackson . Andrew was home to the first governor of Iowa , Ansel Briggs . On September 22 , 1909 the citizens of Andrew erected a granite monument in the city cemetery in his honor .

About 6.1 % of families and 9.3 % of the population were below the poverty line , including 8.1 % of those under age 18 and 7.3 % of those age 65 or over . Andrew School is a public kindergarten through 12th grade school located in town . But as of 2011 will become only kindergarten through 6th grade due to financial reasons . Andrew Community School has been in operation since 1913 . The school is part of Iowa 's Big East Conference . Andrew is a Class 1A school and is considered small even for 1A . Andrew students scored very well in the 2007 Iowa Tests of Educational Development . The Andrew girls ' track and field team won the Class 1A State Championship in 1997 . The Andrew Hawks girls ' basketball team went to state in 2007 . The boys ' team came one win away from state , but were district champions that same year .
Pin stripes are a pattern of very thin stripes running in parallel found in cloth . The pin-striped suit has become associated with conservative business attire , although many designers now produce fashionable pin-stripe patterns for fashion-conscious consumers . Fine lines for vehicles are also called pin stripes . Although found mostly in men 's suits , any type of fabric can be pin-striped . The Chicago Cubs ' baseball uniforms have had pin stripes since 1907 and they are recognized as the first Major League Baseball team to incorporate pin striping into a baseball uniform . Many other Major League Baseball teams â '' including the Minnesota Twins , Montreal Expos , New York Yankees , and Philadelphia Phillies â '' later adopted pin stripes on their own uniforms . This was later carried over into the NBA , with teams like the Charlotte Hornets and Orlando Magic incorporating pin stripes into their uniforms .
They offer research services to people seeking to establish family connections to the Mayflower passengers . An open proxy is a proxy server that is accessible by any Internet user . Generally , a proxy server allows users within a network group to store and forward Internet services such as DNS or web pages to reduce and control the bandwidth used by the group . With an open proxy , however , any user on the Internet is able to use this forwarding service . An anonymous open proxy allows users to conceal their IP address ( and thereby help preserve their anonymity and maintain their security ) while browsing the Web or using other Internet services . While a malcontent may use this anonymity to abuse an accessed service , a citizen of a repressive regime , for example , may rely on an open proxy 's ability to circumvent efforts by their government at internet censorship . Several Web sites provide constantly updated lists of open proxies . It is possible for a computer to run as an open proxy server without the computer 's owner knowing this . This can result from misconfiguration of proxy software running on the computer , or from infection with malware ( viruses , trojans or worms ) designed for this purpose . If it is caused by malware , the infected computer is known as a zombie computer . Running an open proxy is a high risk for the server operator ; providing an anonymous proxy server can cause real legal troubles to the owner . Such services are frequently used to break into foreign computer systems , child pornography is usually consumed through proxies , and illegal content is likely to be spread through such proxies . Also , such a proxy can cause a high bandwidth usage resulting in higher latency to the subnetwork and violation of bandwidth limits . A badly configured open proxy can also allow access to a private subnetwork or DMZ : this is a high security concern for any company or home network because computers that usually are out of risk or firewalled can be directly attacked . Many open proxies run very slowly , sometimes below 14.4 kbit\/s , or even below 300 bit\/s , while other times the speed may change from fast to slow every minute . Some , such as PlanetLab proxies , run faster and were intentionally set up for public use . Because open proxies are often implicated in abuse , a number of methods have been developed to detect them and to refuse service to them . IRC networks with strict usage policies automatically test client systems for known types of open proxies . Likewise , a mail server may be configured to automatically test mail senders for open proxies , using software such as . Increasingly , mail servers are configured out of the box to consult various DNSBL servers in order to block spam ; some of those DNSBLs also list open proxies . As certain governments are particular about the kinds of sites its citizens visit ( Example : Great Firewall of China ) , they often employ trackers who scan IPs tapping into proxy sources , and any that show up in the scan are flagged for a live reviewer to see what the proxy user sees , so depending on what sites they visit , they could get visited by their local law enforcement agency for investigation . Because proxies might be used to abuse , administrators have developed a number of ways to refuse service to open proxies . Many IRC networks automatically test client systems for known types of open proxy . Likewise , an e-mail server may be configured to automatically test e-mail senders for open proxies . As they are typically difficult to track , open proxies are especially useful to those seeking online anonymity , from political dissidents , to computer criminals , to people who simply require privacy because it is within their rights to do so . Some users are merely interested in anonymity for added security , hiding their identities from potentially malicious websites for instance , or on principle , to facilitate the constitutional human right of freedom of speech . Groups of IRC and electronic mail operators run DNSBLs publishing lists of the IP addresses of known open proxies , such as AHBL , CBL , NJABL , and SORBS . The ethics of automatically testing clients for open proxies are controversial . Some experts , such as Vernon Schryver , consider such testing to be `` very bad form '' . Others consider the client to have solicited the scan by connecting to a server whose terms of service include testing . For securing private information during the domain registration process proxy services together with privacy services are often used .
`` Starseed '' is the second single off Our Lady Peace 's first album Naveed , released in 1994 . It was remixed and released on the soundtrack to Armageddon . Also , a live version from the 2003 Live album was released as a single . The song was also planned to be included on the soundtrack for Drew Barrymore 's 1995 film Mad Love but was left off . Art model Saul Fox makes a brief appearance in the music video as well as being on the cover of the promotional single . According to Maida in an interview with the Winnipeg Free Press : `` Starseed was written in five minutes . Chris ( Eacrett ) came up with the bass line and the vibe was so heavy we just wrote it . '' It only took the band twenty more minutes to record the song . The version of `` Starseed '' released in the United States as well as on the Armageddon soundtrack varies slightly from the version released on Naveed . Raine 's famous line , `` Yeah , Yeah , Yeahee '' following the song 's intro was edited out . The ending of the song , which on Naveed ended cold after the last lyric was extended to a fadeout and stretching the song from its original 4 minutes , 7 seconds to 4 minutes and 19 seconds . This version is known as the `` Armageddon Remix '' . `` It was based on this book by Ken Carey , The Starseed Transmissions , about a channeling experience he had . The whole chorus is about if you have had a channeling experience and during this experience you find something you believe and trying to convince everybody else is not always an easy task . I 'm into a lot of meditating . My dad was Catholic and he tried to school me in that , but I never really agreed with him . I 've always been interested in religion and the way it affects society . The Starseed thing is about going on a meditation journey and coming back with something tangible . Something you actually believe in . Something that means something to you . It is hard to convince people of my father 's generation of anything other than the religious values instilled in them . '' - Raine Maida The music video was produced by George Vale and is shot mostly in sepia tone . It was filmed at a former Sears warehouse in Toronto . The video has a very middle-eastern theme akin to the rest of the album , showing people levitating and dressed in turbans . Future bassist Duncan Coutts makes a brief appearance in the video as an extra . During shooting , a light box that moved up and down fell three floors from the ceiling barely missing several band members . The Starseed video was seen on Beavis and Butt-head during the episode `` Green Thumbs '' in 1995 .
Bo ` ness , properly Borrowstounness , is a coastal town in the Falkirk ( council area ) of Scotland , lying on a hillside on the south bank of the Firth of Forth . Before 1975 the town was in the former county of West Lothian . Formerly a center of heavy industry and coal mining , and a major port , the town is now primarily a commuter town . Bo ` ness has important historical links to the Roman period and marks the eastern extent of the Antonine Wall which stretched from Bo ` ness to Old Kilpatrick on the west coast of Scotland . Roman artefacts , some with inscriptions have been found in the eastern part of the town in the parish of Carriden . A Roman fort called Veluniate and long since lost to history once stood on the site now occupied by the grounds of Carriden House . Indeed , it is said that stones from the fort were used in the building of the mansion house . Several artefacts have over the years been uncovered by the local farming community with many of them now on display in the Museum of Edinburgh . Other Roman sites have been identified at Muirhouses ( known locally as `` The Murrays '' ) and Kinglass on the south-east side of the town . Kinneil , in the western part of Bo ` ness , was mentioned by Bede , who wrote that it was named Pennfahel ( `` Wall 's end '' ) in Pictish and Penneltun in Old English . It was also Pengwawl in old Welsh . In the grounds of Kinneil House is the ruin of the small house where James Watt worked on his steam engine . The Antonine Wall was named as an extension to the Frontiers of the Roman Empire World Heritage Site by UNESCO in July 2007 . A Roman fortlet can still be seen at Kinneil Estate . The town was a recognized port from the 16th century ; a harbor was authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1707 . The harbor , constructed progressively during the 18th century , was extended and complemented by a dry dock in 1881 ( works designed by civil engineers Thomas Meik and Patrick Meik ) . The commercial port ( heavily used for the transport of coal and pit props ) eventually closed in 1959 , badly affected by silting and the gradual downturn of the Scottish coal mining industry . Plans currently exist for the regeneration of the docks area including reopening the port as a marina . Bo ` ness was a site for coal mining from medieval times . Clay mining was carried out on a smaller scale . The shore was the site of industrial salt making , evaporating seawater over coal fires . The ruins of several fisheries ( fish storage houses ) along the shoreline evidences long gone commercial fishing activitiy . The town was also home to several sizable potteries , one product being the black `` wally dogs '' which sat in pairs over many fireplaces . Metalworking is still carried out , and the Bo ` ness Iron Company 's drain covers are to be found in many places . Bo ` ness is now primarily a commuter town , with many of its residents traveling to work in Edinburgh , Glasgow or Falkirk . One of the main local sources of employment is the Ineos petrochemical facility-formerly BP-located in nearby Grangemouth and also some small shops in the town Present-day attractions in the town include the Bo ` ness & Kinneil Railway and the Birkhill Fireclay Mine . Kinneil House , built by the powerful Hamilton family in the 15th century , lies on the western edge of the town . In the grounds are a cottage where James Watt worked on his experimental steam engine and the steam cylinder of a Newcomen engine . The remains of an engine house are located in Kinningars Park , off Harbour Road . Bo ` ness has a single secondary school , Bo ` ness Academy , and five primary schools : Deanburn , Kinneil , Bo ` ness Public School , St Mary 's , and the Grange School . There are a number of churches , including Bo ` ness Old Kirk , Carriden , St Andrew 's Parish Church , Craigmailen UFC , St. Catharine 's Episcopal Church , Bo ` ness Apostolic Church , Bo ` ness Baptist Church , The Bo ` ness Salvation Army and St. Mary 's RC , a modernist design of 1962 by Gillespie , Kidd & Coia . There are currently considering to renovate the town 's harbor . Bo ` ness is home to the junior football club Bo ` ness United , and also to Bo ` ness United Ladies and Bo ` ness United Under 16s . Bo ` ness Academy has a rugby team . In the 2008\/2009 season they will be in partnership with Grangemouth rugby club , so they are eligible for competitions and cups . Bo ` ness Cycling Club was reformed in 2010 as Velo Sport Bo ` ness . Jim Smellie was a lesser-known local legend , being an 11 times Scottish Cycling Champion , and some of the trophies collected over the years can be viewed at Kinneil House Museum .

In Great Britain , Canada , the United States , and Australia the corn poppy is worn in remembrance of World War I. Myristicaceae is the botanical name for a family of flowering plants . The family has been recognized by most taxonomists ; it is sometimes called the `` nutmeg family '' , after its most famous member , Nutmeg ( Myristica fragrans ) . The APG II system , of 2003 ( unchanged from the APG system , of 1998 ) , also recognizes this family , and assigns it to the order Magnoliales in the clade magnoliids . The family consists of about twenty genera , with several hundred species , of trees and shrubs , found in tropical areas across the world .
Buncombe County is a county located in the U.S. state of North Carolina . It is part of the Asheville , North Carolina , Metropolitan Statistical Area . The population estimate for 2008 was 229,047 . Its county seat is Asheville . The county was formed in 1791 from parts of Burke County and Rutherford County . It was named for Edward Buncombe , a colonel in the American Revolutionary War , who was captured at the Battle of Germantown . The large county originally extended to the Tennessee line . Many of the settlers were Baptists , and in 1807 the pastors of six churches including the revivalist Sion Blythe formed the French Broad Association of Baptist churches in the area . In 1808 the western part of Buncombe County became Haywood County . In 1833 parts of Burke County and Buncombe County were combined to form Yancey County , and in 1838 the southern part of what was left of Buncombe County became Henderson County . In 1851 parts of Buncombe County and Yancey County were combined to form Madison County . Finally , in 1925 the Broad River township of McDowell County was transferred to Buncombe County . In 1820 , a U.S. Congressman , whose district included Buncombe County , unintentionally contributed a word to the English language . In the Sixteenth Congress , after lengthy debate on the Missouri Compromise , members of the House called for an immediate vote on that important question . Instead , Felix Walker rose to address his colleagues , insisting that his constituents expected him to make a speech `` for Buncombe . '' It was later remarked that Walker 's untimely and irrelevant oration was not just for Buncombeâ '' it `` was Buncombe . '' Thus , buncombe , afterwards spelled bunkum and then shortened to bunk , became a term for empty , nonsensical talk . Buncombe County is a member of the Land-of-Sky Regional Council of governments . Buncombe County has a council\/manager form of government . The 2008 election voted in the current commissioners : K. Ray Bailey , Holly Jones , Bill Stanley , Carol Peterson , and chair David Gantt . The county manager is Wanda Greene . According to the U.S. Census Bureau , the county has a total area of 660 s , of which 656 s is land and 4 s ( 0.58 % ) is water . The French Broad River enters the county at its border with Henderson County to the south and flows north into Madison County . The source of the Swannanoa River , which joins the French Broad River in Asheville , is in northeast Buncombe County near Mount Mitchell . A milestone was achieved in 2003 when Interstate 26 was extended from Mars Hill ( north of Asheville ) to Johnson City , Tennessee , completing a 20-year , half-billion dollar construction project through the Blue Ridge Mountains . The county is divided into sixteen townships : Asheville , Avery Creek , Black Mountain , Broad River , Fairview , Flat Creek , French Broad , Ivy , Leicester , Limestone , Lower Hominy , Reems Creek , Sandy Mush , Swannanoa , Woodfin , and Upper Hominy . As of the census of 2000 , there were 206,330 people , 85,776 households , and 55,668 families residing in the county . The population density was 314 people per square mile ( 121\/km Â ) . There were 93,973 housing units at an average density of 143 per square mile ( 55\/km Â ) . The racial makeup of the county was 89.06 % White , 7.48 % Black or African American , 0.39 % Native American , 0.66 % Asian , 0.04 % Pacific Islander , 1.15 % from other races , and 1.23 % from two or more races . 2.78 % of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race . There were 85,776 households out of which 27.50 % had children under the age of 18 living with them , 50.50 % were married couples living together , 10.80 % had a female householder with no husband present , and 35.10 % were non-families . 28.90 % of all households were made up of individuals and 10.60 % had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older . The average household size was 2.33 and the average family size was 2.86 . In the county the population was spread out with 21.90 % under the age of 18 , 8.60 % from 18 to 24 , 29.30 % from 25 to 44 , 24.80 % from 45 to 64 , and 15.40 % who were 65 years of age or older . The median age was 39 years . For every 100 females there were 92.30 males . For every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 88.90 males . The median income for a household in the county was $ 36,666 , and the median income for a family was $ 45,011 . Males had a median income of $ 30,705 versus $ 23,870 for females . The per capita income for the county was $ 20,384 . About 7.80 % of families and 11.40 % of the population were below the poverty line , including 15.30 % of those under age 18 and 9.80 % of those age 65 or over .
The luffa , loofah , or lufah ( from Arabic Ù Ù Ù ) are tropical and subtropical vines comprising the genus Luffa , the only genus of the subtribe Luffinae of the plant family Cucurbitaceae . The fruit of at least two species , Luffa acutangula and Luffa aegyptiaca ( Luffa cylindrica ) , is grown , harvested before maturity , and eaten as a vegetable , popular in Asia and Africa . The ripe , dried fruit is also the source of the loofah or plant sponge . Luffas are also used to make the soles of beach sandals . Luffa species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species , including Hypercompe albicornis . Parts of the plant are used to create bath or kitchen sponges , a natural remedy for jaundice , furniture and even houses . It is also eaten as a green vegetable . The fruit section of L. aegyptiaca may be allowed to mature and used as a bath or kitchen sponge after being processed to remove everything but the network of xylem or fibers . Marketed as luffa or loofah , the sponge is used like a body scrub . Softly-textured luffa sponges are not derived from the luffa fruit , but are manufactured by folding in several layers of soft mesh-like fabric into a cloud-like shape ; commonly used in tandem with shower soaps . Its juice is used as a natural remedy for jaundice . The juice is obtained by pounding the bitter luffa and squeezing it through a cloth . Bitter luffa seeds and dry crusts are also available and can be used for the same purpose . In Maharashtra , India , dodka ( Ridge Gourd\/luffa ) and ghosavala ( smooth luffa ) are common vegetables prepared with either crushed dried peanuts or with beans . In Northern regions of India , Torai is the common name for Luffa . In China and the Philippines , the luffa or patola is eaten as a green vegetable in various dishes . The luffa is eaten when the fruit is young and the sponge has yet to become tough . It is also known as Chinese Okra in Canada . In Paraguay , panels are made out of luffa combined with other vegetable matter and recycled plastic . These can be used to create furniture and construct houses .
Mafic is an adjective describing a silicate mineral or rock that is rich in magnesium and iron ; the term is a portmanteau of the words `` magnesium '' and `` ferric '' . Most mafic minerals are dark in color and the relative density is greater than 3 . Common rock-forming mafic minerals include olivine , pyroxene , amphibole , and biotite . Common mafic rocks include basalt and gabbro . In terms of chemistry , mafic rocks are on the other side of the rock spectrum from the felsic rocks . The term roughly corresponds to the older basic rock class . Mafic lava , before cooling , has a low viscosity , in comparison to felsic lava , due to the lower silica content in mafic magma . Water and other volatiles can more easily and gradually escape from mafic lava , so eruptions of volcanoes made of mafic lavas are less explosively violent than felsic-lava eruptions . Most mafic-lava volcanoes are oceanic volcanoes , like those in Hawaii .
It will feature head-up and multifunction displays from the Thales Group and Sagem of France . A one instruction set computer ( OISC ) , sometimes called an ultimate reduced instruction set computer ( URISC ) , is an abstract machine that uses only one instruction â `` obviating the need for a machine language opcode . With a judicious choice for the single instruction and given infinite resources , an OISC is capable of being a universal computer in the same manner as traditional computers that have multiple instructions . OISCs have been recommended as aids in teaching computer architecture and have been used as computational models in structural computing research . In a Turing-complete model , each memory location can store an arbitrary integer , and â `` depending on the model â `` there may be arbitrarily many locations . The instructions themselves reside in memory as a sequence of such integers . There exists a class of universal computers with one instruction based on bit manipulation such as bit copying or bit inversion . Since their memory model is the same as memory structure used in real computers , those bit manipulation machines are equivalent to real computers rather than to Turing machines . Only one of these instructions is used in a given implementation . Hence , there is no need for an opcode to identify which instruction is to be executed ; the choice of instruction is inherent in the design of the machine , and an OISC is typically named after the instruction it uses ( e.g. an SBN OISC , the SUBLEQ language , etc. ) . Each of the above instructions can be used to construct a Turing-complete OISC . The subleq instruction ( `` SUbtract and Branch if Less than or EQual to zero '' ) subtracts the contents at address a from the contents at address b , stores the result at address b , and then , if the result is not positive , transfers control to address c ( if the result is positive , execution proceeds to the next instruction in sequence ) . Conditional branching can be suppressed by setting the third operand equal to the address of the next instruction in sequence . If the third operand is not written , this suppression is implied . A variant is also possible with two operands and an internal accumulator , where the accumulator is subtracted from the memory location specified by the first operand . The result is stored in both the accumulator and the memory location , and the second operand specifies the branch address : Although this uses only two ( instead of three ) operands per instruction , correspondingly more instructions are then needed to effect various logical operations . It is possible to synthesize many types of higher-order instructions using only the subleq instruction . Addition can be performed by repeated subtraction , with no conditional branching ; e.g. , the following instructions result in the content at location a being added to the content at location b : The first instruction subtracts the content at location a from the content at location Z ( which is 0 ) and stores the result ( which is the negative of the content at a ) in location Z. The second instruction subtracts this result from b , storing in b this difference ( which is now the sum of the contents originally at a and b ) ; the third instruction restores the value 0 to Z. A copy instruction can be implemented similarly ; e.g. , the following instructions result in the content at location b getting replaced by the content at location a , again assuming the content at location Z is maintained as 0 : Any desired arithmetic test can be built . For example , a branch-if-zero condition can be assembled from the following instructions : BEQ b , c Synthesized instructions subneg POS , Z , c ... c : subneg Z , Z Unconditional branching is assured only if Z initially contains 0 ( or a value less than the integer stored in POS ) . A follow-up instruction is required to clear Z after the branching , assuming that the content of Z is supposed to be maintained as 0 . In a Reverse Subtract and Skip if Borrow ( RSSB ) instruction , the accumulator is subtracted from the memory location and the next instruction is skipped if there was a borrow ( memory location was smaller than the accumulator ) . The result is stored in both the accumulator and the memory location . The program counter is mapped to memory location 0 . The accumulator is mapped to memory location 1 . A transport triggered architecture uses only the move instruction , hence it was originally called a `` move machine '' . This instruction moves the contents of one memory location to another memory location : Arithmetic is performed using a memory-mapped arithmetic logic unit and jumps are performed using a memory-mapped program counter .
Tyler Fredrickson ( born February 26 , 1981 in Santa Barbara , California ) was an American football placekicker in the National Football League . He most recently played for the Oakland Raiders in some pre-season games in the 2007 season but was cut on September 2 of that year before the start of the regular season . While at University of California , Berkeley , he created a film entitled `` Countdown to Kickoff 2003 '' for his master 's thesis in Education . Fredrickson is featured prominently in the Stefan Fatsis book A Few Seconds of Panic .
The Prince Octavius ( 23 February 1779 -- 3 May 1783 ) was a member of the British Royal Family , the thirteenth child and eighth son of George III . Prince Octavius was born , on 23 February 1779 , at Buckingham Palace , Westminster , London , England . His father was George III , his mother Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz . His name derives from Latin octavus , the eighth , showing that he was the eighth son of his parents . Octavius was christened on 23 March 1779 , in the Great Council Chamber at St James 's Palace , by Frederick Cornwallis , The Archbishop of Canterbury . His godparents were The Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb Ã 1\/4 ttel ( husband of his first cousin twice-removed , for whom The Earl of Hertford , Lord Chamberlain , stood proxy ) , The Duke of Mecklenburg ( her first cousin once-removed , for whom The Earl of Ashburnham , Groom of the Stole , stood proxy ) and The Duchess of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach ( wife of her sixth cousin , for whom The Countess von Bruhl , Lady of the Bedchamber to The Queen , was proxy ) . Octavius ' father was extremely devoted to the little boy , who was too young to cause the kinds of trouble that his elder brothers were by the year of his birth . He was a beautiful winning ebullient child , with long golden curls and bright blue eyes . He was close to his nearest sister Sophia , who called Octavius `` her son '' , and went with her and their siblings Elizabeth , and Edward to Eastborne on the Sussex coast , where he could take in the fresh seaside air during the summer of 1780 . When he was nineteen months old , Octavius became an older brother with the birth of his younger brother Alfred . When Octavius was three , Alfred died and he again became the youngest surviving child . Six months later , Prince Octavius suddenly fell ill and died on 3 May 1783 , at Kew Palace , London , aged four years old . His death was unexpected , as unlike his brother Alfred , Octavius had had no apparent signs of illness until two days before his death . Octavius 's death devastated his father . Shortly afterward , King George said `` There will be no heaven for me if Octavius is not there . '' The day after his son 's death , the King passed through a room where Gainsborough was putting the finishing touches on a portrait . The King asked him to stop , but when he found out that the painting was of Octavius , allowed the painter to continue . When this same painting was exhibited a week later , Octavius ' sisters were so upset that they broke down and cried in front of everyone . Three months after Octavius ' death , his father was still dwelling on his son , writing to Lord Dartmouth that every day `` increases the chasm I feel for that beloved object ( Octavius ) . It is well known that , during King George 's madness , he mistook a pillow for the already dead Prince Octavius . '' Prince Octavius was mentioned in The Madness of King George in the scene when King George wakes his children up when he claims London is flooded , and says that his son has killed him ( Octavius was long dead by the time of the film 's setting ) .
Key 103 is an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting to the city of Manchester and the north west of England . Its output is principally contemporary pop and dance music . Formerly owned by Trans World Communications , EMAP and now by Bauer Radio and is part of the company 's Big City Network of stations . The station is based in Castlefield , Manchester . Originally named Piccadilly Radio , from its set up in 1974 , the station was renamed in August 1988 when it was decided to re-brand Piccadilly Radio 's FM frequency to the new name , with a younger target audience in mind . The original Piccadilly Radio continued to broadcast on the AM frequency of 1152 kHz . The station broadcasts on the analog frequency 103FM , from a 4 KW transmitter on Saddleworth Moor and broadcasts on DAB Digital Radio from City Tower ( formerly Sunley Tower ) on the CE Manchester multiplex . Key 103 's live broadcast can also be listened to from their website , but only from inside the UK . The station won three awards at the 2008 Sony radio awards . These consisted of Bronze in the entertainment category for the breakfast show ` Toolan in the Morning ' , Gold in the competition award for ` Sell Me The Answer ' and Gold in the Station of the Year category . As of 2008\/9 , Key 103 and its sister station Piccadilly Magic 1152 are the official commercial radio partners of Manchester United and Manchester City , broadcasting all of both clubs ' games live . Key 103 is broadcast on the FM frequency 103.0 from a Television and Radio Transmitter in Saddleworth . This is broadcast at a high frequency and extensive coverage can be heard throughout the North West of England , Cumbria and North Wales . The DAB digital Radio signal broadcast from the City tower on the CE Manchester multiplex .

`` Narrow-leaved sorrel '' and variants redirect here . These terms may also refer to curled dock ( R. crispus ) . Common sorrel or garden sorrel ( Rumex acetosa ) , often simply called sorrel , is a perennial herb that is cultivated as a garden herb or leaf vegetable ( pot herb ) . Other names for sorrel include spinach dock and narrow-leaved dock . Sorrel is a slender plant about 60 cm high , with roots that run deep into the ground , as well as juicy stems and edible , oblong leaves . The lower leaves are 7 to 15 cm in length , slightly arrow-shaped at the base , with very long petioles . The upper ones are sessile , and frequently become crimson . The leaves are eaten by the larvae of several species of Lepidoptera ( butterfly and moth ) including the blood-vein moth . It has whorled spikes of reddish-green flowers , which bloom in summer , becoming purplish . The stamens and pistils are on different plants ( dioecious ) ; the ripe seeds are brown and shining . Common sorrel has been cultivated for centuries . The leaves may be purÃ ed in soups and sauces or added to salads and shav ; they have a flavor that is similar to kiwifruit or sour wild strawberries . The plant 's sharp taste is due to oxalic acid , which is a poison . In small quantities sorrel is harmless ; in large quantities it can be fatal . In northern Nigeria , sorrel is known as yakuwa or sure ( pronounced suuray ) in Hausa or karassu in Kanuri . It is also used in stews usually in addition to spinach . In some Hausa communities , it is steamed and made into salad using kuli-kuli ( traditional roasted peanut cakes with oil extracted ) , salt , pepper , onion and tomatoes . The recipe varies according to different levels of household income . A very refreshing drink called sob ' o is made from a decoction of the plant calyx . In Romania , wild or garden sorrel , known as mÄ criÅ , is used to make sour soups , stewed with spinach , added fresh to lettuce and spinach in salads or over open sandwiches . In Russia and Ukraine it is called shchavel ' ( Ñ Ð Ð Ð Ð '' Ñ ) and is used to make soup . It is used as a soup ingredient in other countries , too ( e.g. , Lithuania , where it is known as rÅ `` gÅ tynÄ -- ) . In Hungary this is known as soska ( pronounced Shoshka ) . It is called kuzu kulaÄ Ä ( `` lamb 's ear '' ) in Turkish . In Polish it is called szczaw ( pronounced \/ Ê Ê Ê af \/ ) . Among Northern Sami it is known as juopmu and was traditionally added to reindeer milk as a flavoring and preservative . In parts of Belgium it is served mixed with mashed potatoes , or as part of a traditional dish containing eel and other green herbs . In rural Greece it is used with spinach , leeks , and chard in spanakopita .
Rene Rivkin ( 6 June 1944 â `` 1 May 2005 ) was an Australian entrepreneur , investor , investment adviser , and stockbroker . He was a well-known stockbroker in Australia for many years until his conviction for insider trading . Rivkin was born 6 June 1944 in Shanghai , China to Russian-Jewish parents in what was then Japanese-occupied China . His father , Walter , was a Georgian-born trader who had fled to China in the 1920s to escape the Bolsheviks . The elder Rivkin had also once been a champion boxer in Shanghai . The family emigrated to Australia in 1951 . Rivkin attended the selective Sydney Boys High School in Moore Park . In accordance with his father 's wishes , he went on to study law at the University of Sydney . He went on to become the youngest ever member of the Sydney Stock Exchange . Rivkin gained recognition with his publication of the Rivkin Report , in which he would advise what stocks to buy and sell , and provide market analysis . Rivkin sold his share of stockbroking firm Rivkin James Capel after an operation to remove a tumor and the 1987 stockmarket collapse . He was an investor in the plant that was destroyed in the Offset Alpine fire . In April , 2003 , following a long-running investigation by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ( ASIC ) , he was found guilty of insider trading after having purchased 50,000 Qantas shares after being made aware of information in relation to an impending merger of Qantas and Impulse Airlines . He was charged with using confidential and market-sensitive information , having purchased â `` on behalf of Rivkin Investments â `` 50,000 Qantas shares on April 24 , 2001 , just hours after speaking to the executive chairman of Impulse , Gerry McGowan . The trade resulted in a profit of $ 2,664.94 . Rivkin was convicted and sentenced to nine months periodic detention on weekends . His sentence was delayed so he could undergo urgent surgery for a meningioma . His period of custody was punctuated with time served at Long Bay Psychiatric Hospital . After serving two days of his sentence at Sydney 's Silverwater Correctional Centre , Rivkin collapsed and was hospitalised . Banned for life from having a stockbroking licence following the serving of his sentence , Rivkin lived quietly in his Point Piper mansion . After his divorce , he later moved to the Darling Point home of his elderly mother . Rivkin took his own life on May 1 , 2005 at his mother 's apartment .
Rheumatism or rheumatic disorder is a non-specific term for medical problems affecting the joints and connective tissue . The study of , and therapeutic interventions in , such disorders is called rheumatology . The term `` rheumatism '' is still used in colloquial speech and historical contexts , but is no longer frequently used in medical or technical literature ; there is no longer any recognized disorder simply called `` rheumatism '' . Some countries use the word rheumatism to describe fibromyalgia syndrome . The traditional term covers such a range of different problems that to ascribe symptoms to `` rheumatism '' is not to say very much . Nevertheless , sources dealing with rheumatism tend to focus on arthritis . However , `` non-articular rheumatism '' , also known as `` regional pain syndrome '' or `` soft tissue rheumatism '' can cause significant discomfort and difficulty . Furthermore , arthritis and rheumatism between them cover at least 200 different conditions . The term `` Rheumatic Diseases '' is used in MeSH to refer to connective tissue disorders . Palindromic rheumatism has been theorized to be a form of rheumatoid arthritis . Although these disorders probably have little in common in terms of their epidemiology , they do share two characteristics : they cause chronic ( though often intermittent ) pain , and they are difficult to treat . They are also , collectively , very common . A vast number of traditional herbal remedies were recommended for `` rheumatism '' . Modern medicine , both conventional and complementary , recognizes that the different rheumatic disorders have different causes ( and several of them have multiple causes ) and require different kinds of treatment . Nevertheless , initial therapy of the major rheumatological diseases is with analgesics , such as paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , members of which are ibuprofen and diclofenac . Often , stronger analgesics are required . There has long been said to be a link between `` rheumatic '' pain and the weather . There appears to be no firm evidence in favor or against ; a 1995 questionnaire given to 557 people by A. Naser and others at the Brigham and Women 's Hospital 's Pain Management Center concludes that `` changes in barometric pressure are the main link between weather and pain . Low pressure is generally associated with cold , wet weather and an increase in pain . Clear , dry conditions signal high pressure and a decrease in pain '' .

In computer graphics , a raster graphics image or bitmap is a data structure representing a generally rectangular grid of pixels , or points of color , viewable via a monitor , paper , or other display medium . Raster images are stored in image files with varying formats ( see Comparison of graphics file formats ) . A bitmap corresponds bit-for-bit with an image displayed on a screen , generally in the same format used for storage in the display 's video memory , or maybe as a device-independent bitmap . A bitmap is technically characterized by the width and height of the image in pixels and by the number of bits per pixel ( a color depth , which determines the number of colors it can represent ) . The printing and prepress industries know raster graphics as contones ( from `` continuous tones '' ) and refer to vector graphics as `` line work '' . The word `` raster '' has its origins in the Latin rastrum ( a rake ) , which is derived from radere ( to scrape ) . It originally referred to the raster scan of cathode ray tube ( CRT ) video monitors , which paint the image line by line by magnetically steering a focused electron beam . By association , it came also to refer to a rectangular grid of pixels . See also rastrum , a device for drawing musical staff lines . Raster graphics are resolution dependent . They can not scale up to an arbitrary resolution without loss of apparent quality . This property contrasts with the capabilities of vector graphics , which easily scale up to the quality of the device rendering them . Raster graphics deal more practically than vector graphics with photographs and photo-realistic images , while vector graphics often serve better for typesetting or for graphic design . Modern computer-monitors typically display about 72 to 130 pixels per inch ( PPI ) , and some modern consumer printers can resolve 2400 dots per inch ( DPI ) or more ; determining the most appropriate image resolution for a given printer-resolution can pose difficulties , since printed output may have a greater level of detail than a viewer can discern on a monitor . Typically , a resolution of 150 to 300 pixel per inch works well for 4-color process ( CMYK ) printing . Raster-based image editors , such as Painter , Photoshop , MS Paint , and GIMP , revolve around editing pixels , unlike vector-based image editors , such as CorelDRAW , Adobe Illustrator , or Inkscape , which revolve around editing lines and shapes ( vectors ) . When an image is rendered in a raster-based image editor , the image is composed of millions of pixels . At its core , a raster image editor works by manipulating each individual pixel . Most pixel-based image editors work using the RGB color model , but some also allow the use of other color models such as the CMYK color model . A bitmap or pixmap is pixel data storage structure employed by the majority of raster graphics file formats such as PNG . OpenRaster is a file format being developed under the auspices of the Create Project to give free software graphics editors a common raster graphics interchange format , that maintains as much of the working information that the applications use . ICO file format is an image file format for icons in Microsoft Windows . . ico files contain one or more small images at multiple sizes and color depths .
MartÃ n GastÃ n Demichelis ( ; born 20 December 1980 in Justiniano Posse , CÃ rdoba ) is an Argentine footballer who plays as a central defender for MÃ laga CF . He was also a defensive midfielder before Ottmar Hitzfeld chose to employ his defensive prowess more as a center back . His skills as a midfielder make him a ball-player from the back , often bringing the ball forward and showing good comfortable ball possession . A secure presence in the center of defense , he can also operate in a holding role in midfield . A commanding central defender , he is strong in the air and also possesses the ability to time covering tackles to perfection . Demichelis started playing professionally in 1998 at Buenos Aires based club River Plate , but he did not manage to find himself a spot in the starting line-up until 2001 . He had some good performances at River Plate , which resulted in a transfer to Bayern Munich in 2003 . Demichelis ' first season with Bayern Munich was not very positive , because he suffered a number of minor injuries , but under the command of coach Felix Magath , he found a place in the team 's starting line-up . MartÃ n has also played a vital role for Bayern in winning their three doubles in 2005 , 2006 and 2010 . After being dropped from the starting lineup against Wolfsburg in the opening game of the 2010 â `` 11 Bundesliga , he requested that Louis van Gaal omit him from the squad altogether , which van Gaal did . Demichelis thereafter voiced to the press that it would be probable that he and the club went separate ways . End of December 2010 , Demichelis agreed to a deal with Spanish side MÃ laga where he would reunite with his old manager from River Plate , Manuel Pellegrini . On 11 September 2007 , he scored his first international goal for Argentina in a friendly match against Australia , in which his header proved to be the winning scoreline 1 â `` 0 . On 22 June 2010 , he scored the first goal of the match for Argentina against Greece in the 2010 FIFA World Cup . Demichelis holds an Italian passport .
Pink is a mixture of red and white . Commonly used for Valentine 's Day and Easter , pink is sometimes referred to as `` the color of love . '' The use of the word for the color we know today as pink was first recorded in the late 17th century . Although pink is roughly considered just as a tint of red , in fact most variations of pink lie between red , white and magenta colors . This means that the pink 's hue is somewhat between red and magenta . Roseus is a Latin word meaning `` rosy '' or `` pink . '' Lucretius used the word to describe the dawn in his epic poem On the Nature of Things ( De Rerum Natura ) . The word is also used in the binomial names of several species , such as the Rosy Starling ( Sturnus roseus ) and Catharanthus roseus . In most Indo-European languages , the color pink is called rosa . In Persian , it is called '' Ø Ù Ø Ø Ù '' , meaning `` Color of the face '' . The color pink is named after the flowers called pinks , flowering plants in the genus Dianthus . The name derives from the frilled edge of the flowersâ '' the verb `` to pink '' dates from the 14th century and means `` to decorate with a perforated or punched pattern '' ( possibly from German `` pinken '' = to peck ) . As noted and referenced above , the word â pinkâ was first used as a noun to refer to the color we know today as pink in the late 17th century . The verb sense of the word â pinkâ continues to be used today in the name of the hand tool known as pinking shears . In the 17th century , the word pink or pinke was also used to describe a yellowish pigment , which was mixed with blue colors to yield greenish colors . Thomas Jenner 's A Book of Drawing , Limning , Washing ( 1652 ) categorizes `` Pink & blew bice '' amongst the greens ( p. 38 ) , and specifies several admixtures of greenish colors made with pinkâ '' e.g. `` Grasse-green is made of Pink and Bice , it is shadowed with Indigo and Pink ... French-green of Pink and Indico ( shadowed with ) Indico '' ( pp . 38 â `` 40 ) . In William Salmon 's Polygraphice ( 1673 ) , `` Pink yellow '' is mentioned amongst the chief yellow pigments ( p. 96 ) , and the reader is instructed to mix it with either Saffron or Ceruse for `` sad '' or `` light '' shades thereof , respectively ( p. 98 ) .

Zinc-aluminium ( ZA ) alloys are named as such because the main constituents are zinc and aluminium . Other alloying elements include magnesium and copper . This type of alloy was originally developed for gravity casting . Noranda , New Jersey Zinc Co. . Ltd. , St. Joe Mineral Co. and ILZRO were the main companies that pioneered the ZA alloys between the 1950s and the 1970s . They were designed to compete with bronze , cast iron and aluminium using sand and permanent mold casting methods . Distinguishing features of ZA alloys include high as-cast strength , excellent bearing properties , as well as low energy requirements ( for melting ) . ZA alloys make good bearings because their final composition includes hard eutectic zinc-aluminium-copper particles embedded in a softer zinc-aluminium matrix . The hard particles provide a low-friction bearing surface , while the softer material wears back to provide space for lubricant to flow , similar to Babbitt metal . The numbers associated with the name represent the amount of aluminium in the alloy ( i.e. ZA8 has 8 % aluminium ) .
Cataplexy is a sudden and transient episode of loss of muscle tone , often triggered by emotions . It is a rare disease ( prevalence of fewer than 5 per 10,000 in the community ) , but frequently affects people who have narcolepsy , a disorder whose principal signs are EDS ( Excessive Daytime Sleepiness ) , sleep attacks , sleep paralysis , hypnagogic hallucinations and disturbed night-time sleep . Cataplexy is sometimes confused with epilepsy , in which a series of flashes or other stimuli can cause superficially similar seizures . Cataplexy can also be present as a side effect of SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome . The term cataplexy originates from the Greek Î Î Ï Î ( kata , meaning `` downwards '' ) , and Ï Î '' Î Î 3\/4 Î Ï ( plÄ `` xis , meaning `` paralysis '' ) . Cataplexy manifests itself as muscular weakness which may range from a barely perceptible slackening of the facial muscles to the dropping of the jaw or head , weakness at the knees , or a total collapse . Usually the speech is slurred , vision is impaired ( double vision , inability to focus ) , but hearing and awareness remain normal . These attacks are triggered by strong emotions such as exhilaration , anger , fear , surprise , orgasm , awe , embarrassment , and laughter . A person 's efforts to stave off cataplectic attacks by avoiding these emotions may greatly diminish their quality of life , and they may become severely restricted emotionally if diagnosis and treatment is not begun as soon as possible . Cataplexy may be partial or complete , affecting a range of muscle groups , from those controlling facial features to ( less commonly ) those controlling the entire body . When cataplexy happens often , or cataplexy attacks make patients fall or drop things , it can have serious effects on normal activities . It can cause accidents and be embarrassing when it happens at work or with friends . For example , people with cataplexy may not pick up babies because they are afraid they may drop them . Despite its relation to narcolepsy , in most cases , cataplexy must be treated differently and separate medication must be taken . For many years , cataplexy has been treated with tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine , clomipramine or protriptyline . However these can have unpleasant side-effects and so have been generally replaced by newer drugs such as venlafaxine , a more recent antidepressant . A treatment option for cataplexy associated with narcolepsy is Xyrem ( sodium oxybate ) oral solution . Xyrem is a prescription medication manufactured by Jazz Pharmaceuticals , and is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for the treatment of cataplexy associated with narcolepsy and Excessive Daytime Sleepiness ( EDS ) associated with narcolepsy . The American Academy of Sleep Medicine ( AASM ) recently recognized Xyrem as a standard of care for the treatment of cataplexy , daytime sleepiness , and disrupted sleep due to narcolepsy in its Practice Parameters for the Treatment of Narcolepsy and other Hypersomnias of Central Origin . These recommendations are based upon careful review of the medical literature , and the designation â standardâ of care â reflects a high degree of clinical certaintyâ based on strong empirical evidence . Xyrem is the only medication specifically indicated and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for cataplexy associated with narcolepsy . Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may be used to manage both cataplexy and the REM sleep-onset symptoms of sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations . Emerging therapies include Hypnotic Psychotherapy , Hypocretin Gene Therapy , and Hypocretin Cell Transplantation for narcolepsy-cataplexy .

Wigtownshire or the County of Wigtown is a registration county in the Southern Uplands of south west Scotland . Until 1975 , the county was one of the administrative counties used for local government purposes , and is now administered as part of the council area of Dumfries and Galloway . The county town was historically Wigtown , with the administrative center moving to Stranraer - the largest town - on the creation of a county council in 1890 . As Wigtown , the county forms the lieutenancy area of the Lord Lieutenant of Wigtown . Wigtownshire borders Ayrshire to the north , and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright to the east . Together The Stewartry and Wigtownshire are referred to as Galloway : until the 19th century Wigtownshire was also sometimes known as West Galloway . Wigtownshire includes the southernmost point in Scotland , the Mull of Galloway , the Machars and the Rhins of Galloway peninsula . Major road links to the area comprise the A77 to the north , and the A75 to the east .

The 1952 Summer Olympics , officially known as the Games of the XV Olympiad , were an international multi-sport event held in Helsinki , Finland in 1952 . Helsinki had been earlier given the 1940 Summer Olympics , which were canceled due to World War II . It is famous for being the Olympic Games at which the most number of world records were broken . Helsinki was chosen as the host city over bids from Amsterdam and five American cities : Chicago , Detroit , Los Angeles , Minneapolis and Philadelphia , at the 40th IOC Session on June 21 , 1947 , in Stockholm , Sweden . A total of 69 nations participated in these Games , up from 59 in the 1948 Games . Thirteen nations made their first Olympic appearance in 1952 : The Bahamas , China , Gold Coast ( now Ghana ) , Guatemala , Hong Kong , Indonesia , Israel , Netherlands Antilles , Nigeria , Soviet Union ( USSR ) , Thailand , and Vietnam . Japan and Germany were both reinstated and permitted to send athletes after being banned for 1948 for their instigation of World War II . Due to the division of Germany , German athletes from Saar entered a separate team for the only time . Only West Germany would provide athletes for the actual Germany team , since East Germany refused to participate in a joint German team . These are the top ten nations that won medals at these Games .

Teltow-Fl Ã ming is a Kreis ( district ) in the southwestern part of Brandenburg , Germany . Neighboring districts are ( from the east clockwise ) Dahme-Spreewald , Elbe-Elster , the districts Wittenberg in Saxony-Anhalt , the district Potsdam-Mittelmark , and the Bundesland Berlin . The district is named after the two main regions . The Teltow is an agricultural belt south of Berlin . The FlÃ ming is a wooded hill chain in the south ; the portion located in this district is called the Lower FlÃ ming , while the Higher FlÃ ming is situated in Potsdam-Mittelmark . The district was formed in December 1993 by merging the previous districts Luckenwalde , JÃ 1\/4 terbog and Zossen , but also including small parts from other former districts such as Luckau . In the time from 1997 to 2001 , the district had the biggest increase in the gross economic product of all districts of Germany with a rate of +56.1 % . FlÃ ming-Skate is a 160 k long route specially for inline skating , the only such route in Germany .

Wheel gymnastics ( German : RhÃ nradturnen ) is a form of gymnastics which originated in Germany . Wheel gymnasts do exercises in a large wheel known as the RhÃ nrad , gymnastics wheel , gym wheel , or German wheel . There are three core categories of exercise : straight line , spiral , and vault . The Wheel was invented in 1925 by Otto Feick in SchÃ nau an der Brend . The son of a blacksmith , Feick was inspired by the memory of an event from his childhood in Reichenbach , when he had tied sticks between two beer barrel bands that his father had made and rolled down a hill . He filed for a patent as `` wheel-gymnastic and sports equipment '' . He had invented the wheel in Ludwigshafen am Rhein ca . 1920-1922 , on the grounds of the VSK Germania , a sports club , of which he was the founding chairman . The patent was issued on 8 November 1925 ; the name `` RhÃ nrad '' has been protected and registered since 1926 . In 1936 this sport was shown at the Olympic Games in Berlin , but was not presented as an Olympic discipline . The focus of wheel gymnastics remains largely in Germany .
Sierra Mist is a lemon-lime flavored caffeine-free soft drink , introduced by PepsiCo in 2000 and rolled out nationally in the United States in 2003 . PepsiCo owns the rights to the similar 7 Up brand outside the U.S. and therefore has not yet introduced Sierra Mist in international markets . Following initial test marketing , PepsiCo first introduced Sierra Mist in 2000 , replacing similar soft drinks such as lemon-lime Slice and the test-marketed Storm . The selection of the name `` Sierra Mist '' was based on favorable market research involving 2,000 people . `` Sierra Mist '' was selected from over 1,000 possible names . Diet Sierra Mist was also introduced in 2000 , and sales of both diet and original Sierra Mist totaled $ 100 million in its first year of production . At the time of its launch in 2000 , Sierra Mist was only distributed in certain regional markets , due to bottling and distribution agreements between Pepsi Bottling Group and 7 Up parent company Cadbury Schweppes . The PepsiCo bottlers continued to bottle 7 Up until existing agreements with Cadbury Schweppes expired in January 2003 , at which point its distribution was expanded nationwide in the U.S. . In 2004 the beverage had surpassed 7 Up on the basis of annual retail sales , placing it as the 2nd most-purchased lemon-lime soft drink in the U.S. ( Sprite being the 1st ) . In 2005 , Diet Sierra Mist was renamed Sierra Mist Free , intended as a descriptor of the beverage being `` free of '' sugar , calories , carbohydrates and caffeine . This name change was reverted back to the original name , Diet Sierra Mist , in November 2008 . In late 2006 , PepsiCo introduced Sierra Mist Cranberry Splash . It was only available during the Winter holiday season . Cranberry Splash returned in the fall and winter of 2007 , 2008 , 2009 , 2010 along with Diet Sierra Mist Cranberry Splash . In May 2007 Sierra Mist Lemon Squeeze was introduced . This limited edition featured a higher concentration of lemon flavor and was only available through September 2007 . Sierra Mist can and bottle labels were redesigned as a part of Pepsico 's broader redesign of its core carbonated soft drink brands in 2008 , with Sierra Mist Free reverting back to the Diet Sierra Mist name in the process . . The Sierra Mist logo was later redesigned again in March 2010 with a typeface similar to that of the current Pepsi design . Sierra Mist underwent a more significant rebranding in August 2010 , in response to shifting consumer preferences towards products made with natural ingredients - according to beverage industry and general news media reporting at the time . On August 29 , 2010 , Sierra Mist was replaced with Sierra Mist Natural , reflecting its use of sugar as a natural sweetener . Updated logos , bottle labeling and can designs were also implemented at the same time . From 2000 until 2010 Sierra Mist was sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup , and its other ingredients were listed as carbonated water , high-fructose corn syrup , citric acid , natural flavors , potassium benzoate , potassium citrate , ascorbic acid and calcium disodium EDTA . Diet Sierra Mist is sweetened with aspartame and acesulfame potassium . In August 2010 PepsiCo replaced the original Sierra Mist namesake product with Sierra Mist Natural , which is sweetened with sugar ( instead of high-fructose corn syrup ) and contains four other ingredients : carbonated water , citric acid , natural flavor and potassium citrate . In 2005 , a series of improv-based Sierra Mist commercials titled `` Mist Takes '' began airing . The commercials featured comedians Nicole Sullivan , Debra Wilson , Aries Spears , Jim Gaffigan and Michael Ian Black . In 2006 , Kathy Griffin , Tracy Morgan and Guillermo Diaz joined the cast . Diaz and other members of the cast of Otro Rollo starred in the Spanish-language versions of the commercials . In December 2007 , PepsiCo trademarked the names Sierra Mist : Undercover Orange and Sierra Mist Free : Undercover Orange . The two sodas launched under a limited-time release in the summer of 2008 ( with the faces of Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway on their labels ) , serving as a marketing tie-in with the release of the Warner Bros. film Get Smart on June 20 , 2008 . Sierra Mist : Undercover Orange and Sierra Mist Free : Undercover Orange were both clear sodas , like regular and Diet Sierra Mist , but had a mandarin orange flavor . Sierra Mist is an official partner and sponsor of Major League Soccer and two franchises within the league , the New England Revolution and D.C. United .
Rafflesia is a genus of parasitic flowering plants . It contains approximately 28 species ( including four incompletely characterized species as recognized by Willem Meijer in 1997 ) , all found in southeastern Asia , on the Malay Peninsula , Borneo , Sumatra , and the Philippines . Rafflesia was found in the Indonesian rain forest by an Indonesian guide working for Dr. Joseph Arnold in 1818 , and named after Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles , the leader of the expedition . It was discovered even earlier by Louis Deschamps in Java between 1791 and 1794 , but his notes and illustrations , seized by the British in 1803 , were not available to western science until 1861 . The plant has no stems , leaves or true roots . It is an endoparasite of vines in the genus Tetrastigma ( Vitaceae ) , spreading its absorptive organ , the haustorium , inside the tissue of the vine . The only part of the plant that can be seen outside the host vine is the five-petaled flower . In some species , such as Rafflesia arnoldii , the flower may be over 100 c in diameter , and weigh up to 10 k. Even the smallest species , R. baletei , has 12 cm diameter flowers . The flowers look and smell like rotting flesh , hence its local names which translate to `` corpse flower '' or `` meat flower '' ( but see below ) . The vile smell that the flower gives off attracts insects such as flies , which transport pollen from male to female flowers . Most species have separate male and female flowers , but a few have bisexual flowers . Little is known about seed dispersal . However , tree shrews and other forest mammals apparently eat the fruits and disperse the seeds . Rafflesia is an official state flower of Indonesia , also Sabah state in Malaysia , as well as for the Surat Thani Province , Thailand . The name `` corpse flower '' applied to Rafflesia is confusing because this common name also refers to the Titan Arum ( Amorphophallus titanum ) of the family Araceae . Moreover , because Amorphophallus has the world 's largest unbranched inflorescence , it is sometimes mistakenly credited as having the world 's largest flower . Both Rafflesia and Amorphophallus are flowering plants , but they are still distantly related . Rafflesia arnoldii has the largest single flower of any flowering plant , at least when one judges this by weight . Amorphophallus titanum has the largest unbranched inflorescence , while the Talipot palm ( Corypha umbraculifera ) forms the largest branched inflorescence , containing thousands of flowers ; this plant is monocarpic , meaning that individuals die after flowering . Comparison of mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) sequences of Rafflesia with other angiosperm mtDNA indicated that this parasite evolved from photosynthetic plants of the order Malpighiales . Another study from that same year confirmed this result using both mtDNA and nuclear DNA sequences , and showed that three other groups traditionally classified in Rafflesiaceae were unrelated . A more recent study found Rafflesia and its relatives to be embedded within the family Euphorbiaceae , which is surprising as members of that family typically have very small flowers . According to their analysis , the rate of flower size evolution was more or less constant throughout the family except at the origin of Rafflesiaceae , where the flowers rapidly evolved to become much larger before reverting to the slower rate of change . Since 2002 there has been a tremendous amount of activity by Filipino scientists who have discovered and named several new species of Rafflesia . But Before this time there were two species known : R. manillana and R. schadenbergiana , the latter of which was last seen in 1882 on Mt. Apo in Davao Province on Mindanao Island , but was thought to be extinct . The following gives a chronicle of these activities :
Rounder Records , originally of Cambridge , Massachusetts , but now based in Burlington , Massachusetts , is a record label founded in 1970 by Ken Irwin , Bill Nowlin and Marian Leighton-Levy , while all three were still university students . It once served as a major distributor and central sales location for other independent labels specializing in roots music , at one point representing as many as 450 other labels . In the 1990s , though , the company cut back on the distribution effort in order to focus on its own productions . In the early 2000s , shortly after the merger of the PolyGram and MCA label families , Rounder signed a manufacturing and distribution deal with Universal Music , which also purchased an interest in the label . Starting with blues , blues-rock , string band , and bluegrass , Rounder expanded to over 3,000 titles of folk , soul , soca , Cajun , and Celtic . The name was chosen partly because of its association with the band Holy Modal Rounders . The word rounder also means a hobo or tramp . One of their earliest successes was the blues-rock band George Thorogood and the Destroyers . One of the label 's projects is the Alan Lomax Collection , a series of releases of the work of the pioneering ethnomusiclogist and folklorist . Among Rounder 's artists , bluegrass superstar Alison Krauss ( who had been with the label for the duration of her career ) was offered a number of major label deals following her commercial breakthrough in the late 1990s , but Krauss opted to remain with Rounder . Rounder was one of the very first labels to become involved with compact discs , in 1985 . In 2004 , the company launched a book division known as Rounder Books . In 2010 , Rounder was purchased by the Concord Music Group . It will continue to be distributed by Universal , as all of Concord has a distribution deal with UMG .

A penetrometer is a device to test the strength of a material such as soil . There are many types of penetrometer . They are usually round or cone shaped . The penetrometer is dropped on the test subject or pressed against it and the depth of the resulting hole is measured . The measurements determine whether the soil is strong enough to build a road on . Scientists also use a penetrometer to measure how much moisture is in soil . Penetrometers are used on space probes such as the Cassini-Huygens probe , to measure the amount of moisture in soil on other planets .

The order Peramelemorphia includes the bandicoots and bilbies : it equates approximately to the mainstream of marsupial omnivores . All members of the order are endemic to the twin land masses of Australia-New Guinea and most have the characteristic bandicoot shape : a plump , arch-backed body with a long , delicately tapering snout , very large upright ears , relatively long , thin legs , and a thin tail . Their size varies from about 140 grams up to 2 kilograms , but most species are about the weight of a half-grown kitten : somewhere around one kilogram . The position of the Peramelemorphia within the marsupial family tree has long been puzzling and controversial . There are two morphological features in the order that appear to show a clear evolutionary link with another marsupial group : the type of foot , and the teeth . Unfortunately , these clear signposts point in opposite directions . All members of the order are polyprotodont ( have several pairs of lower front teeth ) -- in the case of the Peramelemorphia , three pairs . This suggests that they have evolved within Dasyuromorphia ( marsupial carnivores ) . On the other hand , they also have an unusual feature in their feet : the second and third toes are fused together . This condition is called syndactyly , and is characteristic of the Diprotodontia ( the order of marsupial herbivores that includes kangaroos , wombats , possums , and many others ) . Attempts to resolve this puzzle include the view that the bandicoot group evolved from the carnivores , retaining the polyprotodont dentition , and independently evolving a syndactyl hind foot ; the contrary view that syndactyly is so unusual that it is unlikely to have evolved twice and therefore the bandicoot group must have evolved from a possum-like diprotodont creature , and re-evolved its extra teeth . A third view suggests that the bandicoot group evolved from a primitive carnivore , developed the syndactylous hind foot as a specialisation for climbing , and the diprotodonts then split off and evolved the two-tooth jaw that gives them their name . Recent molecular level investigations do not so far appear to have resolved the puzzle , but do strongly suggest that whatever the relationship of the bandicoot group to the other marsupial orders may be , it is a distant one . To provide context , the table below also shows the other major branches of the Australasian marsupial tree .
Paul Hermann MÃ 1\/4 ller also known as Pauly Mueller ( January 12 , 1899 -- October 12 , 1965 ) was a Swiss chemist and Nobel laureate .

VÃ xjÃ is a city and the seat of VÃ xjÃ Municipality , Kronoberg County , Sweden with 64 200 inhabitants in 2010 . It is the administrative , cultural and industrial center of Kronoberg County . Furthermore it is the episcopal see of the Diocese of VÃ xjÃ . It has a population of about 64 200 , out of a municipal total of 83,000 inhabitants . The town is home to Linnaeus University . The city 's name is believed to be constructed from the words `` vÃ g '' ( road ) and `` sjÃ '' ( lake ) , meaning the road over the frozen VÃ xjÃ Lake that farmers took in the winter to get to the marketplace that later became the city . In contrast to what was believed a century ago , there is no evidence of a special pre-Christian significance of the site . The pagan cultic center of VÃ rend may have been located at Hov , a village nearby . Even though the city has been an Episcopal see since the 12th century , it did not get its city charter until 1342 , issued by Magnus Eriksson . During the Middle Ages VÃ xjÃ did not have many pious institutions . A Franciscan monastery was established in 1485 . There was a hospital of the Holy Ghost , first mentioned in 1318 . In the 14th century VÃ xjÃ got its first school , VÃ xjÃ katedralskola , that was much visited . By 1643 it received gymnasium status . At the beginning of Gustav Eriksson 's war of liberation , the peasantry joined forces under the guidance of the union-hostile bishop Ingemar Pedersson , the mountain men and the peasantry of Dalarna , HÃ lsingland and GÃ strikland , who urged fidelity to the their leader Gustav Eriksson . During the Dacke War , a peasant uprising , the city was in the hands of Nils Dacke and his supporters from the summer of 1542 until after New Year 1543 . The city residents and the clergy seem to have adopted a cautious neutrality , even though common sympathies rested with Dacke . Several times during the Northern Wars , Scanian Wars and thereafter , the city has been plagued by fire ( in 1277 , 1516 , 1570 , 1612 , 1658 , 1690 , 1749 , 1753 , 1799 , 1838 and 1843 ) . After the last fire in 1843 , when 1140 citizens were rendered homeless , VÃ xjÃ got its current street plan . Linnaeus University has 15,000 students ( 2008 ) . Industries include Alstom and Aerotech Telub . VÃ xjÃ houses Sweden 's National Glass Museum and claims to be the capital of the `` Kingdom of Crystal '' as well as of the `` Kingdom of Furniture '' . The Swedish Emigrant Institute was established in 1965 and resides in the House of Emigrants near the VÃ xjÃ lake in the heart of the city . It contains archives , library , museum , and a research center relating to the emigration period between 1846 and 1930 , when 1.3 million ( or 20 % ) of the Swedish population emigrated , mainly to the USA . Archives , dating to the 17th century , of birth and death records as well as household records are available on microfiche . Immediately north of VÃ xjÃ is Kronoberg Castle , a ruined fortress constructed in the 15th century . This castle was used as base by rebel Nils Dacke during the Dacke War . The fortress has thick walls and an interesting array of artillery portals that face out onto the lake HelgasjÃ n to the north . The city also holds another castle , Teleborg Castle built in 1900 and situated near the University .
The Brown Pelican ( Pelecanus occidentalis ) is the smallest of the eight species of pelican , although it is a large bird in nearly every other regard . It is 106 - in length , weighs from 2.75 t and has a wingspan from 1.83 t. The Brown Pelican occurs on coasts in the Americas from Washington and Virginia south to northern Peru and the mouth of the Amazon River , as well as the island of Saut d'Eau in Trinidad and Tobago . Some immature birds may stray to inland freshwater lakes . After nesting , North American birds move in flocks further north along the coasts , returning to warmer waters for winter . Their young are hatched in broods of about 3 , and eat around 150 lbs . of fish in the 8 â `` 10 month period they are cared for . This bird is distinguished from the American White Pelican by its brown body and its habit of diving for fish from the air , as opposed to co-operative fishing from the surface . It eats mainly fish and amphibians as well as crustaceans . Groups of Brown Pelicans often travel in single file , flying low over the water 's surface . The nest location varies from a simple scrape on the ground on an island to a bulky stick nest in a low tree . These birds nest in colonies , usually on islands . Pesticides like DDT and dieldrin threatened the Brown Pelican 's future in the southeast United States and California in the early 1970s . Pesticides also threatened the pelican population in Florida in this period . A research group from the University of Tampa headed by Dr. Ralph Schreiber conducted research in the Tampa Bay\/St Petersburg area and found that DDT caused the pelican eggshells to be too thin and incapable of supporting the embryo to maturity . As a result of this research , DDT usage was eliminated in Florida , followed by the rest of the US . Along with the American White Pelican , the Brown Pelican is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 . The International Union for Conservation of Nature 's Red List has listed the Brown Pelican as Least Concern since 1988 . The US government imposed a ban on the use of DDT in 1972 . Since then , the population of Brown Pelican has increased . Current estimates place the population at 650,000 individuals . Millions of barrels of crude oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill caused by the explosion in April 2010 of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico may drift ashore and threaten the subspecies of the Brown Pelican that lives in Louisiana . The Peruvian Pelican , Pelecanus thagus , used to be considered a subspecies of the Brown Pelican ( P. o. thagus ) . Due to its well-defined allopatry and because it is much larger and heavier than its relatives , it has been reclassified as a separate species . The Brown Pelican is the national bird of the Turks and Caicos Islands , and state bird of Louisiana . It is also one of the mascots of Tulane University and is on both Tulane 's and Louisiana State University 's seal . It is also on the Crest of the University of the West Indies .
Servants in Heaven , Kings in Hell is the fifth studio album by hip hop group Jedi Mind Tricks . It was released September 19 , 2006 through Babygrande Records . The first single , `` Heavy Metal Kings '' , featuring Ill Bill of La Coka Nostra , was released in early August through iTunes and a limited edition vinyl pressing . Additional guest appearances on the album are provided by Shara Worden of My Brightest Diamond , Sean Price , R.A. the Rugged Man , Block McCloud and Army of the Pharaohs members Chief Kamachi and Reef the Lost Cauze . As with previous Jedi Mind Tricks albums , many of the track titles appear to be lifted from previous songs by heavy metal groups . For example , `` When All Light Dies '' was previously the title of a song by Trivium ; `` Serenity in Murder '' is also the name of a Slayer track ; `` Razorblade Salvation '' is also a song by Sinergy ; and `` Black Winter Day '' is the name of a track by Amorphis . The album title , as well , could potentially be a reference to the Kreator track `` Servant in Heaven ( King in Hell ) '' from their Violent Revolution album . Servants in Heaven became the group 's most commercially successful release , being their first album to break into the Billboard 200 , and also landed in the top ten on the Independent Albums chart , and the top fifty on the Top R&B \/ Hip Hop Albums chart . The album was warmly received critically , especially when compared to their two previous efforts , Visions of Gandhi and Legacy of Blood , which both received mixed reviews . Allmusic gave the album a positive four star rating ; writer Marisa Brown stated : An exclusive version of the album was released at Trans World Entertainment chain stores . This version features three bonus tracks , a remixed version of `` Heavy Metal Kings '' , performed with California hardcore band Terror , the D-Tension mixtape track `` Pretty Little Whores '' , featuring Outerspace , and `` Blitz Inc. '' , featuring King Syze and Esoteric , as well as a bonus DVD , featuring the `` Heavy Metal Kings '' music video .
Protoclepsydrops was an early amniote , and its skeletal remains indicate that it may have been more closely related to synapsids than to sauropsids , making it a possible synapsid member . If so , it is the oldest synapsid known , though its status is unconfirmed because its remains were fragmentary . Protoclepsydrops lived slightly earlier than Archaeothyris . Like Archaeothyris , Protoclepsydrops resembled modern lizards . However , Protoclepsydrops still had primitive vertebrae with tiny neural processes typical of the first ( stem - ) amniotes .
A server log is a log file ( or several files ) automatically created and maintained by a server of activity performed by it . A typical example is a web server log which maintains a history of page requests . The W3C maintains a standard format ( the Common Log Format ) for web server log files , but other proprietary formats exist . More recent entries are typically appended to the end of the file . Information about the request , including client IP address , request date\/time , page requested , HTTP code , bytes served , user agent , and referrer are typically added . These data can be combined into a single file , or separated into distinct logs , such as an access log , error log , or referrer log . However , server logs typically do not collect user-specific information . These files are usually not accessible to general Internet users , only to the webmaster or other administrative person . A statistical analysis of the server log may be used to examine traffic patterns by time of day , day of week , referrer , or user agent . Efficient web site administration , adequate hosting resources and the fine tuning of sales efforts can be aided by analysis of the web server logs . Marketing departments of any organization that owns a website should be trained to understand these powerful tools .
Steropodon galmani was a prehistoric species of monotreme , or egg-laying mammal , that lived during the middle Albian stage , in the Lower Cretaceous period . It is the second-earliest known relative of the Platypus . Steropodon is known only from a single opalised jaw with three molars , discovered at the Griman Creek Formation , Lightning Ridge , New South Wales , Australia , by brothers David and Alan Galman . It was a large mammal for the Mesozoic , being 40 â `` 50 cm long . The lower molars are 5 â `` 7 mm in length , with a width of 3 â `` 4 mm . A length of 1 â `` 2 cm is more typical for Mesozoic mammals . Also from Lightning Ridge is Kollikodon ritchiei . The molars `` bear striking resemblance to the tribosphenic pattern characteristic of living therians ... '' ( Pascual ) . However , there are also differences : there is no entoconid , and an absence of wear seems to suggest that the upper molars ( as yet unknown ) did not have a protocone , and so implying that there was a double origin of tribosphenic teeth , one group represented by the living placentals and marsupials , and the other group being the monotremes bearing ` pseudo-tribosphenic ' teeth . Woodburne ( 2003 , p. 212 ) reports that the holotype is a right mandible named AM F66763 . The preserved molars are m1 â `` m3 . Page 237 includes : `` In Steropodon , the mandibular canal suggests the presence of a bill , with a bill also known in Obdurodon dicksoni and Ornithorhynchus anatinus . ''

Motorways often push down nearby residential land values , but proximity to a rapid transit station often triggers commercial and residential growth , with large office and housing blocks being constructed . A municipality is a local government administrative division composed of a defined territory and population . While there are many varieties of municipalities , most fall into one of two categories : ( 1 ) a single settlement , a city , town , or village , and ( 2 ) a land area similar to a township that may contain multiple settlements , or even just part of one , such as a city 's borough . A town municipality is typically governed by a mayor and a council , while others may have appointed prefects . A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision , as opposed to a special-purpose district . In most countries , a municipality is the smallest administrative subdivision to have democratically elected representation . Municipalities are sometimes referred to as `` communes '' ( for example , French commune , Italian comune , Romanian comunÄ , Swedish kommun and Norwegian\/Danish kommune ) . The term derives from the medieval commune . The term `` municipality '' is used in some countries to refer to the municipal administrative building known elsewhere as the town hall or city hall . The largest municipalities can be found in Australia , Brazil , Canada , Greenland , and Iceland .
A museum in Glarus is dedicated to her . The Neue ZÃ 1\/4 rcher Zeitung ( NZZ ) is a major German language Swiss daily newspaper based in Zurich . One of the oldest newspapers still published , it originally appeared as ZÃ 1\/4 rcher Zeitung , edited by Salomon Gessner , from January 12 , 1780 , and was renamed to Neue ZÃ 1\/4 rcher Zeitung in 1821 . The newspaper is well known for its detailed reports on international affairs , stock exchange , and the intellectual , in-depth style of its articles . Politically , it is positioned close to the liberal Free Democratic Party of Switzerland . It has a reputation as a quality newspaper and as the Swiss newspaper of record , with a small but influential circulation of 330,000 . As its average reader is now over 50 , its circulation is slowly declining . Aside from the switch from its Blackletter typeface in 1946 , the newspaper has changed little since the 1930s . The newspaper has , for example , only in the last 3 years or so added color pictures , much later than most mainstream papers . The emphasis is on international news , business , finance , and high culture . Features and lifestyle stories are kept to a minimum . In 2002 , a weekend edition called NZZ am Sonntag ( NZZ on Sunday ) was launched . The NZZ am Sonntag has its own editorial staff and contains more soft news and lifestyle issues than its weekday counterpart , as do most Swiss weekend newspapers . In 2005 , the complete run of the first 225 years of the newspaper was scanned from microfilm , a total of 2 million images comprising 70 terabytes , and its blackletter type was OCR ` ed at a total cost of 600,000 â ( or 0.30 â per image ) . The result is a searchable digital archive , which is however only publicly accessible on site .

A city named Chip existed near the community that became Fleming and it was quickly built up and served as a trading center for the nearby coal towns . The train that hauled the coal out of Fleming would make stops in Neon and it is an accepted legend by locals that a man on the train would yell instructions to people climbing on board the train saying `` Knee On '' This was soon changed to Neon and replaced the name Chip .

The Fiat Marea is a small family car available as a saloon and an estate ( Fiat Marea Weekend ) , produced by the Italian automaker Fiat . Launched in 1996 , the Marea models were essentially different body styles of Fiat 's hatchback offerings , the Bravo and Brava . The Marea replaced the earlier Tipo-based Fiat Tempra . While the Fiat Stilo Multiwagon is the successor of the Marea Weekend , the Fiat Linea is scheduled to replace the saloon version in 2007 . The Marea was originally manufactured in Fiat 's Cassino and Mirafiori plants in Italy . Later the Marea also superseded the Tempra in Brazilian ( Betim ) and Turkish ( in Bursa , with TofaÅ ) plants , which make vehicles mostly for local and other developing markets . In Europe , production and sales of the Marea ceased in 2002 , a year after the Bravo and Brava were replaced with the Fiat Stilo . The Marea Weekend was replaced by the Stilo Multiwagon , while the saloon was dropped altogether due to relatively low popularity of compact saloon cars in Europe . Nevertheless , the Marea ( in both body styles ) is still manufactured in Turkey and Brazil for local ( and other Latin American ) markets . The Brazilian version was facelifted in 2001 , when it gained a redesigned rear end with taillights taken from the Lancia Lybra . For 2006 the Marea was mildly revised again , gaining a new rear end , and a new grille , similar in style to other current Fiat models . In mid-2007 , Brazilian production of the Marea and Marea Weekend ceased ; their successor , Fiat Linea , will be produced from mid-2008 on , although it is not sure if it will feature an estate version . The Marea petrol and turbodiesel engines 1.2 L , 1.4 L , 1.6 L , 1.8 L and 2.0 L petrol and 1.9 L were sourced from the Brava and Bravo , and a 2.0 20v turbo option from the Fiat CoupÃ was also available . For a short time there was also a 2.4 turbodiesel available , dropped in 2001 , which has become sought after . A Marea BiPower 1.6 L dual fuel engine was later added to the range ; it may run on either petrol or compressed natural gas . The Marea was introduced in 1998 into the Brazilian market with only one engine : the 2.0 20v . Due to Brazilian production taxes the 2.0 20v engine had its electronic fuel injection remapped to limit the engine power to 128 b in the Marea SX and ELX models of 1999 . The engine retained its full power ( 142 bhp ) on the more expensive Marea HLX model . Simply exchanging the SX or ELX fuel injection chip with the HLX chip would bring back the original engine power . Fiat initially claimed it to be untrue explaining that other modifications had been made in the SX\/ELX models for cost-savings , but this was revealed to be false . In 2000 the 2.0 20v engine was replaced with the 2.4 20v ( 160 bhp ) engine in the HLX model , and the SX model started using the 1.8 16v engine ( 130 bhp ) , while the ELX injection was mapped as it had originally been for the HLX to give the 2.0 20v engine the original engine power ( 141 bhp ) . Later the 2.0 20v engine was dropped and the 1.6 16v ( 105 bhp ) engine was introduced ; this engine was the only one produced for model year 2007 , when the Marea production has been discontinued . All engines for the Fiat Marea in Brazil were petrol-based , with no diesel variants .

This article concerns the Hindu avatar . For the ancient kingdom , see Matsya Rajya . For other uses , see Matsya ( disambiguation ) . Matsya ( Fish in Sanskrit ) was the first Avatar of Vishnu in Hindu mythology . According to the Matsya Purana , the king of pre-ancient Dravida and a devotee of Vishnu , Satyavrata who later was known as Manu was washing his hands in a river when a little fish swam into his hands and pleaded with him to save its life . He put it in a jar , which it soon outgrew . He then moved it to a tank , a river and then finally the ocean but to no avail . The fish then revealed himself to be Vishnu and told him that a deluge would occur within seven days that would destroy all life . Therefore , Satyavrata was instructed to take `` all medicinal herbs , all the varieties of seeds , and accompanied by the seven saintsâ along with the serpent Vasuki and other animals . Lord Matsya is generally represented as a four-armed figure with the upper torso of a man and the lower of a fish .
He taught Arabic at Canning College , Lucknow . Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman was a Pakistani politician and an important Muslim figure during British India , as a leader of the All India Muslim League in the United Provinces ( now Uttar Pradesh ) .

A revival meeting ( or crusade ) is a series of Christian religious services held in order to inspire active members of a church body and to gain new converts . These meetings are often conducted by members of Protestant churches and those educated or influenced by them ; missionary works of such churches often conduct revivals in Africa and India . Generally speaking , a revival meeting consists of several consecutive nights of services conducted at the same time and location each night , most often the building belonging to the sponsoring congregation but sometimes a rented secular assembly hall , for more adequate space , to provide a setting that is more comfortable for non-Christians , or to reach an community where there are no churches . Tents were very frequently employed in this effort in the recent past , and occasionally still are , but less so due to the difficulties in heating and cooling them and otherwise making them comfortable , an increasing consideration with modern audiences . The length of such meetings varies . Until the last quarter-century they were frequently a week or more in duration , especially in the Southern United States . Currently three or four days is more typical , although occasionally some are still held , especially in Pentecostal groups , `` according to Holy Spirit time '' , that is until the visible results seem to slow or stop and attendance dwindles . Most groups holding revival meetings tend to be of a conservative or fundamentalist nature , although the phenomenon is far from unheard of in other Mainline groups , which used to conduct them with a far greater frequency and fervor in some instances than is now fashionable . Similar events may be referred to as `` crusades '' , especially when a particularly noted speaker like Billy Graham or Oral Roberts is involved . In the Churches of Christ such events are almost invariably referred to as gospel meetings rather than revival meetings . This group is one of the most likely to conduct such events in the 21st century . For the most part , aside from the large , spectacular `` crusades '' , most American Protestant groups other than Baptists and Pentecostals have become less active in holding revival meetings in recent years , but some of the vacuum has been filled by similar activities hosted by nondenominational community churches , most of which are conservative in theology . Many revivals are attempts to catch much of the flavor and fervor of the camp meeting without exposing their participants to the physical rigors of such an experience . This movement has been portrayed by director Richard Brooks in his 1960 film Elmer Gantry with Burt Lancaster ( who received the Academy Award for this film ) and Jean Simmons , adapted from Sinclair Lewis ' eponymous novel . There is a revival scene in the 1997 film The Apostle , starring Robert Duvall . Duvall 's portrayal of an evangelical minister earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination . The Academy Award winning documentary Marjoe reviews the career of child-evangelist Marjoe Gortner , giving a behind-the-scenes look at revivals he promoted as an adult . The film was never distributed in the Bible Belt , as Gortner exposed the money-making tricks charlatan evangelists engaged in . The movie Leap of Faith , starring Steve Martin , depicts a fake faith healer , his fraudulent traveling revival show , and the consequences when he accomplishes a genuine miracle . Borat Sagdiyev visited a revival meeting in his feature film . A tent revival meeting was attended in Blues Brothers 2000 . Neil Diamond 's Brother Love 's Traveling Salvation Show depicts a revival meeting .

Arnos Grove is a London Underground station on the Piccadilly line between Bounds Green and Southgate . It is in Travelcard Zone 4 and is located in Arnos Grove , near Arnos Park on Bowes Road , London . The station and surrounding neighborhood of Arnos Grove take their names from the Arnos Grove estate , which was north of the station . The station is the first surface station north after the long tunnel section from Barons Court via Central London . The station was opened on 19 September 1932 as the most northerly on the first section of the Piccadilly Line extension from Finsbury Park to Cockfosters . It was the terminus of the line until services were further extended to Oakwood on 13 March 1933 . Its name was chosen after public deliberation : alternatives were `` Arnos Park '' , `` Bowes Road '' and `` Southgate '' . Like the other stations Charles Holden designed for the extension , Arnos Grove was built in a modern European style using brick , glass and reinforced concrete and basic geometric shapes . A circular drum-like ticket hall of brick and glass panels rises from a low single-storey structure and is capped by a flat concrete roof . The design was inspired by the Stockholm City Library and Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund . A similar design was employed by Holden for the rebuilding of Chiswick Park on the District Line ( also in 1932 ) , although the drum there is supplemented with an adjacent brick tower . The center of the ticket hall is occupied by a disused ticket office ( a passimeter in London Underground parlance ) which houses an exhibition on the station and the line . Like Holden 's other stations on the extension , Arnos Grove is a Grade II listed building . The building is one of the 12 `` Great Modern Buildings '' profiled in The Guardian during October 2007 , and was summarised by architectural critic Jonathan Glancey as '' ... truly what German art historians would describe as a gesamtkunstwerk , a total and entire work of art . '' Three parallel train tracks pass through the station , with two double-sided platforms between the central track and the outer tracks . The edges of the platforms are labeled platform 1 and 2 , and platform 3 and 4 , in such a way that the two outer tracks are accessible from platforms 1 and 4 , and the central track , usually used by trains that terminate and reverse at Arnos Grove station , is accessible from platforms 2 and 3 . Platforms 1 and 2 are designated for trains to Cockfosters , platforms 3 and 4 for trains to Central London . When operational problems occur on the line , Arnos Grove station may act as a temporary terminus of a reduced service - either a shuttle service between Arnos Grove and Cockfosters or a truncated service from Central London . The station has a set of seven sidings to its south for stabling trains . In 2005 the station underwent a refurbishment program including improvements to signage , security and train information systems . Some of the original signs are in a ` petit-serif ' adaptation of the London Underground typeface , Johnston Sans . This type-face was designed by Charles Holden and Percy Delf Smith . The station is part of the Arnos Grove group of stations , comprising all seven stations from Cockfosters to Turnpike Lane , and the management office for the group is in Arnos Grove station . Linked to the station by a lineside passageway is Ash House , which is a drivers ' depot . Arnos Grove is often noted for its station cat ( a rarity on the London Underground network ) , called Spooky , who now occupies the station car park after being evicted due to the introduction of UTS gates . New Southgate railway station is a five minute walk from Arnos Grove or a two minute bus journey on the 232 and 382 bus routes .

The Rochester Lancers were a soccer team based in Rochester , New York that played in the American Soccer League from 1967 until 1969 and the North American Soccer League from 1970 to 1980 at Aquinas Stadium ( renamed Holleder Memorial Stadium in 1974 ) . They were owned by Bernie Rodin , who also owned the New York Arrows and the Baltimore Blast . After three years competing in the ASL , the club jumped to the newer NASL and won the league championship in their first season . They followed that up with a division title the next season and a second consecutive MVP award for forward Carlos Metidieri . They were the only NASL club in history to participate in an international tournament , in the 1971 CONCACAF Champions ' Cup where they finished in fourth-place . The Lancers could not sustain their early success through the rest of the decade . Posting only a couple of winning records and a few playoff appearances , the team folded after the 1980 season . However , starting in 1978 most of the Lancer lineup competed in the NASL 's off-season as the New York Arrows of the Major Indoor Soccer League ; under that name the squad lasted until 1984 and won several championships in the other league . A new team named after the Lancers are set to begin play in November of 2011 in the newly founded I-League .

The National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) , known between 1901 and 1988 as the National Bureau of Standards ( NBS ) , is a measurement standards laboratory which is a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce . The institute 's official mission is to : NIST had an operating budget for fiscal year 2007 ( October 1 , 2006-September 30 , 2007 ) of about $ 843.3 million . NIST 's 2009 budget was $ 992 million , but it also received $ 610 million as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act . NIST employs about 2,900 scientists , engineers , technicians , and support and administrative personnel . About 1,800 NIST associates ( guest researchers and engineers from American companies and foreign nations ) complement the staff . In addition , NIST partners with 1,400 manufacturing specialists and staff at nearly 350 affiliated centers around the country . NIST is headquartered in Gaithersburg , Maryland , and operates a facility in Boulder , Colorado . NIST 's activities are organized into laboratory programs , and extramural programs . Effective October 1 , 2010 , NIST was realigned by reducing the number of NIST laboratory units from ten to six . NIST Laboratories include : NIST 's Boulder laboratories are best known for NIST-F1 , housing an atomic clock . NIST-F1 serves as the source of the nation 's official time . From its measurement of the natural resonance frequency of caesium -- which is used to define the second -- NIST broadcasts time signals via longwave radio station WWVB at Fort Collins , Colorado , and shortwave radio stations WWV and WWVH , located at Fort Collins , Colorado and Kekaha , Hawaii , respectively . NIST also operates a neutron science user facility : the NIST Center for Neutron Research ( NCNR ) . The NCNR provides scientists access to a variety of neutron scattering instruments , which are used in many fields of research ( materials science , fuel cells , biotechnology , etc. ) . The SURF III Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility is a source of synchrotron radiation , in continuous operation since 1961 . SURF III now serves as the US national standard for source-based radiometry throughout the generalized optical spectrum . All NASA-borne extreme-ultraviolet observation instruments have been calibrated at SURF since the 1970s , and SURF is used for measurement and characterization of systems for extreme ultraviolet lithography . The Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology ( CNST ) performs research in nanotechnology , both through internal research efforts and by running a user-accessible cleanroom nanomanufacturing facility . This ` NanoFab ' is equipped with tools for lithographic patterning and imaging ( e.g. electron microscopes and atomic force microscopes ) . As part of its mission , NIST supplies industry , academia , government , and other users with over 1,300 Standard Reference Materials ( SRMs ) . These artifacts are certified as having specific characteristics or component content , used as calibration standards for measuring equipment and procedures , quality control benchmarks for industrial processes , and experimental control samples . NIST is currently developing government-wide identification card standards for federal employees and contractors to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to government buildings and computer systems . In 2002 the National Construction Safety Team Act mandated NIST to conduct an investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings 1 and 2 and the 47-story 7 World Trade Center . The investigation , directed by lead investigator Shyam Sunder , covered three aspects , including a technical building and fire safety investigation to study the factors contributing to the probable cause of the collapses of the WTC Towers ( WTC 1 and 2 ) and WTC 7 . NIST also established a research and development program to provide the technical basis for improved building and fire codes , standards , and practices , and a dissemination and technical assistance program to engage leaders of the construction and building community in implementing proposed changes to practices , standards , and codes . NIST also is providing practical guidance and tools to better prepare facility owners , contractors , architects , engineers , emergency responders , and regulatory authorities to respond to future disasters . The investigation portion of the response plan was completed with the release of the final report on 7 World Trade Center on November 20 , 2008 . The final report on the WTC Towers -- including 30 recommendations for improving building and occupant safety -- was released on October 26 , 2005 . NIST works in conjunction with the Technical Guidelines Development Committee of the Election Assistance Commission to develop the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines for voting machines and other election technology . SAMATE ( Software Assurance Metrics And Tool Evaluation ) is a NIST project focused on improving software assurance by developing methods to enable software tool evaluations , measuring the effectiveness of tools and techniques , and identifying gaps in tools and methods . Three researchers at NIST have been awarded Nobel Prizes for their work in physics : William D. Phillips in 1997 , Eric A. Cornell in 2001 , and John L. Hall in 2005 , which is the largest number for any US government laboratory . Other notable people who have worked at NIST include : Since 1989 , the director of NIST has been a Schedule-C Presidential appointee and is confirmed by the United States Senate , and since that year the average tenure of NIST directors has fallen from 11 years to 2 years in duration . Fourteen persons have officially held the position ( in addition to three acting directors who served temporarily ) . They are : NBS Director Allen V. Astin is the father of actor John Astin and the grandfather of actor Sean Astin .
A shear stress , denoted ( Greek : tau ) , is defined as a stress which is applied parallel or tangential to a face of a material , as opposed to a normal stress which is applied perpendicularly . = the shear stress ; F = the force applied ; A = the cross sectional area . Beam shear is defined as the internal shear stress of a beam caused by the shear force applied to the beam . V = total shear force at the location in question ; Q = statical moment of area ; t = thickness in the material perpendicular to the shear ; I = Moment of Inertia of the entire cross sectional area . This formula is also known as the Jourawski formula . Shear stresses within a semi-monocoque structure may be calculated by idealizing the cross-section of the structure into a set of stringers ( carrying only axial loads ) and webs ( carrying only shear flows ) . Dividing the shear flow by the thickness of a given portion of the semi-monocoque structure yields the shear stress . Thus , the maximum shear stress will occur either in the web of maximum shear flow or minimum thickness . Also constructions in soil can fail due to shear ; e.g. , the weight of an earth-filled dam or dike may cause the subsoil to collapse , like a small landslide . = mass moment of inertia ; = angular speed . Any real fluids ( liquids and gases included ) moving along solid boundary will incur a shear stress on that boundary . The no-slip condition dictates that the speed of the fluid at the boundary ( relative to the boundary ) is zero , but at some height from the boundary the flow speed must equal that of the fluid . The region between these two points is aptly named the boundary layer . For all Newtonian fluids in laminar flow the shear stress is proportional to the strain rate in the fluid where the viscosity is the constant of proportionality . However for Non Newtonian fluids , this is no longer the case as for these fluids the viscosity is not constant . The shear stress is imparted onto the boundary as a result of this loss of velocity . The shear stress , for a Newtonian fluid , at a surface element parallel to a flat plate , at the point y , is given by : where is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid ; is the velocity of the fluid along the boundary ; is the height above the boundary . In case of wind , the shear stress at the boundary is called wind stress . This relationship can be exploited to measure the wall shear stress . If a sensor could directly measure the gradient of the velocity profile at the wall , then multiplying by the dynamic viscosity would yield the shear stress . Such a sensor was demonstrated by A. A. Naqwi and W. C. Reynolds . The interference pattern generated by sending a beam of light through two parallel slits forms a network of linearly diverging fringes that seem to originate from the plane of the two slits ( see double-slit experiment ) . As a particle in a fluid passes through the fringes , a receiver detects the reflection of the fringe pattern . The signal can be processed , and knowing the fringe angle , the height and velocity of the particle can be extrapolated . A further technique recently proposed is that of slender wall-mounted micro-pillars made of the flexible polymer PDMS , which bend in reaction to the applying drag forces in the vicinity of the wall . The deflection of the pillar tips from a reference position is detected optically and serves as a representative of the wall-shear stress . It allows the instantaneous detection of the streamwise and spanwise wall-shear stress distribution in turbulent flow up to high Reynolds numbers .
Kim Yoon-ok ( born March 26 , 1947 ) is the current First Lady of the Republic of Korea .

Urinal deodorizer blocks , also often called urinal cakes , urinal mints , or urinal pucks , are the small disinfectant blocks found in urinals . The purpose of these blocks is to disinfect and deodorize restroom urinals , placed above the urinal drain ( often in the confines of a small plastic trap that prevents their loss down the drain when they dissolve to a small size ) . These are usually cylindrical tablets used to prevent bad odors in washrooms . The chemicals composing the block may vary . The original formulations were of naphthalene and later paradichlorobenzine ( pDCB ) , both now known to be hazardous to health by inhalation . Most urinal blocks are now paradichlorobenzene-free . The block 's functionality is enhanced by saturating it with a scenting compound and quaternary ammonium compounds . They come in a variety of shapes and sizes , and weigh from about 20 grams up to about 100 grams when new . Paradichlorobenzine and napthalene blocks do not actually dissolve in water or urine , but only sublimate into the air , creating an odor that masks the smell of urine . Urinal-deodorizer companies now produce water-soluble versions made from surfactants , which offer some active cleaning efficacy . The new water-soluble blocks improve the cleaning of the pipes to remove some of the cause of odor problems . Some recent formulations also include bacterial strains which , coupled with the surfactant cleaning power , can completely eradicate odors and blockages caused by the buildup of solids in the traps and pipes . Some manufacturers claim that these `` biological blocks '' can enable completely no-flush waterless urinals to be fitted .

Various productions such as the 2002 play Jatt and Bond use Maula Jat as their `` inspiration '' . The Blood of Hussain is a Pakistani film directed by Jamil Dehlavi and released in 1980 ( released in February 1981 in the UK ) . The film was banned throughout Pakistan as the military junta led by General Zia-ul-Haq toppled the government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto . The film is about the life and death of Hussain , the youngest son of a Pakistani family . He meets a holy soothsayer who foretells his destiny , which is to liberate the poor and oppressed against a tyrannical government . The struggle parallels that of Imam Hussain of the 7th century who was martyred by Yazid I , the Umayyad Caliph . The Blood of Hussain is known as To Aima tou agonisti in Greece , Husseins Herzblut in Germany and Le Sang d'Hussain in France . The film was banned by the Pakistani military ruler General Zia ul-Haq , after he seized power in a coup de Ã tat and became President of Pakistan in 1977 , as the film portrays a fictional military coup in a less than favourable light . The ban on the film has not been lifted , and the director later moved to the United Kingdom .

Large format lenses are photographic optics that provide an image circle large enough to cover large format film or plates . Large format lenses are typically used in large format cameras and view cameras . Photographic optics generally project a circular image behind the lens . On smaller format cameras the image circle generally covers only the intended film size with little room to spare . Large format lenses are an exception . For large format use the circular patch of image light usually extends beyond the minimum size circle needed to fully cover the rectangle of the film . The extra image offers some or a great deal of room to spare since large format cameras usually make use of camera movements that re-align the lens away from dead center on the film . The film is often positioned as far off center as just inside the periphery of the image circle . Large format lenses are usually designed to cover more than the actual film size to allow the use of camera movements for control of the plane of focus and perspective . Lenses of the same general construction are often given a name implying this design . For example , a Tessar always has four elements in three groups as described below , although Tessars have been produced with different focal lengths and maximum apertures for many decades . Sometimes a name does not identify a specific design ; Kodak 's Ektar lens brand name encompasses many different types . Sometimes different manufacturers use different names for lenses of the same type ; for example the VoigtlÃ nder Skopar is of Tessar design . And sometimes identical lenses are sold under different names and at different prices ; for example , lenses branded as Rodenstock and Caltar . Early lenses suffered from flare and low contrast , worsening as the number of lens-air interfaces increased . The introduction of and improvements in anti-reflective coatings vastly reduced flare ; some many-element lens designs which had been abandoned due to low contrast in spite of otherwise excellent performance became practical . Lenses designed for use with monochromatic film , first orthochromatic , then panchromatic , had less exacting requirements regarding chromatic aberrations than when color film is used . When using older lenses today one should check that chromatic aberrations and flare are acceptable for the application . A true telephoto lens is designed to require less bellows extension than a long-focus lens of the same focal length .
Colin Healy ( born 14 March 1980 in Cork ) is an international footballer for the Republic of Ireland , currently playing with Ipswich Town . Healy was born in Ballincollig in County Cork . He came from a sporting family , with his grandfather Paddy Healy having been a Gaelic footballer and hurler who won All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship medals with the Cork inter-county football and hurling teams respectively in 1945 and 1946 . His brother Pat plays with Ballinhassig in the Munster Senior League . Healy played local soccer with Ballincollig and then Wilton United . He attended the FAS\/FAI course in Cork run by former Celtic and Cork City midfielder Mick Conroy and from here he was taken to Celtic Park . He would go on to score three goals for Celtic , his first coming in a league game against Dundee in February 2000 , and followed this up with League Cup goals against Hearts and Stirling Albion . He played and scored a goal against Australia at the FIFA World Youth Championship finals in Nigeria in 1999 . Represented his country at the UEFA U-19 Championship in Sweden in 1999 where he won a bronze medal . During the Saipan incident between Mick McCarthy and fellow Cork man Roy Keane at the 2002 FIFA World Cup , Healy was called upon by McCarthy as the replacement should Keane be dropped from the squad . A succession of changes-of-heart by the Manchester United player led to the call-up being delayed and the deadline passing , with Healy unable to join the World Cup squad . Sunderland succeeded in signing Healy from Celtic in 2003 . In December 2003 he broke his leg in a match against a former loan club , Coventry City after a challenge by Moroccan international Youssef Safri . In October 2004 , he broke his leg again soon after resuming training with Sunderland after a challlange with then manager mick mcarthy . In January 2006 , it was announced that Healy 's contract with Sunderland had expired , and the midfielder left the club . Healy joined SPL club Livingston on 10 March 2006 until the end of the season . On 10 August 2006 Healy signed a one year contract with Barnsley . Having made only 10 appearances for Barnsley , he had his contract canceled by mutual consent . On 20 February 2007 he signed a two-year contract with hometown League of Ireland club Cork City , alongside former international colleague Gareth Farrelly . FIFA ruled both players to be unable to play for the club , citing a rule forbidding players from transferring between clubs more than twice in a 12 month period between July and June . FIFA rejected appeals made by both players . On 1 July 2007 both Healy and Gareth Farrelly became eligible to play for Cork City . On this date , they both played for the club 's under-21 team against Lifford of Ennis , Co Clare , winning the game 2 â `` 0 . Healy made his full Cork City debut against Bohemians when they were beaten in extra time in the Eircom League Cup Quarter Final held at Dalymount Park on 3 July 2007 . Healy signed a two-year contract for Cork in 2009 . In April 2009 , Healy scored his only goal for Cork at Tallaght Stadium . On 16 July 2009 it was confirmed that Cork City had accepted a Â # 100,000 bid from Hartlepool United to take Healy and fellow Cork City team-mate Denis Behan to Victoria Park , Hartlepool . However five days later , Hartlepool United manager Chris Turner confirmed that the deal had not happened due to late interest from Ipswich Town . Healy subsequently signed for Ipswich for an undisclosed fee . In January 2010 , he signed on-loan with Scottish Premier League club Falkirk . In February 2011 Healy scored his first goal for the club against Doncaster Rovers .
Playground slides are found in parks , schools , playgrounds and backyards . The slide may be flat , or half cylindrical or tubular to prevent falls . Slides are usually constructed of plastic or metal and they have a smooth surface that is either straight or wavy . The user , typically a child , climbs to the top of the slide via a ladder or stairs and sits down on the top of the slide and `` slides '' down the slide . In Australia the playground slide is known as a slippery slide or slippery dip . Sliding pond or sliding pon is a term used in the New York City area to denote a playground slide . A playground slide is called Ghasargundi in Marathi ( a language in India ) . An archaic word for the slide in Marathi is `` Fisal Patti '' . This word was used decades back by those could n't pronounce Ghasargundi well . A playground slide may be wrapped around a central pole to form a descending spiral forming a simple helter skelter . A playground slide ( and some professional slides ) may be covered or enclosed by a sheath of plastic . This allows slide participants to have more privacy and security when sliding . Larger versions of the playground slide are much higher with multiple parallel slideways . Participants may be provided with a sack to sit on to reduce friction for faster speeds and to protect clothing . A variation of a slide is used in waterparks and swimming pools and is called a water slide .

In mechanics , the normal force ( occasionally N ) is the component , perpendicular to the surface of contact , of the contact force exerted on an object by , for example , the surface of a floor or wall , preventing the object from penetrating the surface . The normal force is one of the components of the ground reaction force and may coincide with it , for example considering a person standing still on the ground , in which case the ground reaction force reduces to the normal force . In another common situation , if an object hits a surface with some speed , and the surface can withstand it , the normal force provides for a rapid deceleration , which will depend on the flexibility of the surface . In a simple case such as an object resting upon a table , the normal force on the object is equal but in opposite direction to the gravitational force applied on the object ( or the weight of the object ) , that is , , where m is mass , and g is the gravitational field strength ( about 9.81 Newtons\/kilogram on Earth ) . The normal force here represents the force applied by the table against the object that prevents it from sinking through the table , and requires that the table is sturdy enough to deliver this normal force without breaking . Where an object rests on an incline , the normal force is perpendicular to the plane the object rests on . Still , the normal force will be as large as necessary to prevent sinking through the surface , presuming the surface is sturdy enough . The strength of the force can be calculated as : where N is the normal force , m is the mass of the object , g is the gravitational field strength , and Î is the angle of the inclined surface measured from the horizontal . The normal force is one of several forces which act on the object . In the simple situations so far considered , the most important other forces acting on it are friction and the force of gravity . In general , the magnitude of the normal force , N , is the projection of the net surface interaction force , T , in the normal direction , n , and so the normal force vector can be found by scaling the normal direction by the net surface interaction force . The surface interaction force , in turn , is equal to the dot product of the unit normal with the stress tensor describing the stress state of the surface . That is , The parallel shear component of the contact force is known as the frictional force . For a person standing in an elevator either stationary or moving at constant velocity , the normal force on the person 's feet balances the person 's weight . In an elevator that is accelerating upward , the normal force is greater than the person 's ground weight and so the person 's perceived weight increases ( making the person feel heavier ) . In an elevator that is accelerating downward , the normal force is less than the person 's ground weight and so a passenger 's perceived weight decreases . If a passenger were to stand on a `` weighing scale '' , such as a conventional bathroom scale , while riding the elevator , the scale will be reading the normal force it delivers to the passenger 's feet , and will be different than the person 's ground weight if the elevator cab is accelerating up or down . The weighing scale measures normal force ( which varies as the elevator cab accelerates ) , not gravitational force ( which does not vary as the cab accelerates ) . It is impossible to measure true gravitational force without knowledge of the motion of one 's immediate environment . In Lagrangian Mechanics , the normal force plays an important part in its formalization . Suppose a smooth surface , , is defined by the explicit equation . Furthermore , suppose a particle must move along this surface . The equation of motion would be given by

Cam Fowler ( born December 5 , 1991 ) is a Canadian-American professional ice hockey defenseman currently playing for the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . He was selected twelfth overall by the Ducks in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft . A dual citizen , Fowler represents the United States internationally , and won a gold medal as a member of the American team at the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships . He was a member of the 2010 Windsor Spitfires team that won the OHL championship as well as the Memorial Cup . Fowler was born in Windsor , Ontario , the son of Perry and Bridget . Perry was a native of Newfoundland and Bridget is a native of Michigan , making Cam a dual citizen . An employee of the Ford Motor Company , Perry moved his family to Farmington Hills , Michigan before Cam 's second birthday . His younger sisters , Peyton and Emily , were both born in the United States . Fowler attended Farmington High School where he played baseball in addition to hockey . He also played travel baseball for the South Farmington Blues and had great potential to be a Division One College pitcher . Describing himself as being one of the weaker players on the team as a youth , Fowler 's potential as a hockey player did not emerge until his teenage years . He was recruited by numerous National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Division I schools from the age of 14 . Fowler signed a National Letter of Intent with the University of Notre Dame in November 2008 during the early signing period . The USA Hockey National Team Development Program ( USNTDP ) also recruited him to their organization . The Kitchener Rangers drafted Fowler with their first pick in the 2007 OHL Priority Selection ; however given he had already committed to Notre Dame and playing in the OHL would have cost him his eligibility to play in the NCAA , Fowler refused to sign with the Rangers and instead made a two-year commitment to play for the USNTDP . With the development team , he was a member of the gold medal-winning American team at the 2009 IIHF World U18 Championships where was named the best defenseman of the tournament and an all-star . The Rangers surrendered his OHL rights at about the same time Fowler was reconsidering his commitment to play in the NCAA . The Windsor Spitfires selected him with their first pick in the 2008 Priority Selection , after which he broke his agreement with Notre Dame and agreed to play for Windsor in the 2009 â `` 10 OHL season . Fowler made the decision with the belief that playing in the OHL would better prepare him for a National Hockey League ( NHL ) career . The decision upset university officials who alleged he was paid under the table by the OHL . Notre Dame coach Jeff Jackson alleged that the Rangers had offered Fowler a package worth $ 500,000 to break his commitment with the Fighting Irish and believed that Windsor had also made a financial offer to lure him away from the school . Fowler denied the accusations , stating he was `` completely honest '' with both Notre Dame and the Kitchener Rangers . Fowler joined the Spitfires in 2009 and emerged as one of the top offensive-defensemen in the league , scoring 55 points in 55 games . He added 14 points in the playoffs to help lead Windsor to its second consecutive J. Ross Robertson Cup championship . The Spitfires then won the 2010 Memorial Cup as Canadian Hockey League champions . Fowler left the Spitfires briefly during the season to play with the American team at the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships and won a gold medal after the United States defeated Canada 6 â `` 5 in overtime in the championship game . The NHL Central Scouting Bureau ranked Fowler as the 5th best North American prospect for the 2010 NHL Entry Draft in their final update . He had dropped two places , having been ranked at # 3 , behind Taylor Hall and Tyler Seguin , for most of the season . He is described by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau as an offensive quarterback on the powerplay who relies on his skating and puck control . He has been compared to NHL defencemen Chris Pronger and Dion Phaneuf , but does not play the same physical style as those two . Despite these accolades , Fowler 's draft night lasted longer than expected as he was drafted at twelfth overall by the Anaheim Ducks . Fowler started the 2010 â `` 11 NHL season on the Ducks opening lineup . He scored his first NHL goal on October 17 , 2010 against Jason LaBarbera of the Phoenix Coyotes .
Omaroseonee Manigault-Stallworth ( born February 15 , 1974 ) , usually known simply as Omarosa , is a two-time participant on Donald Trump 's television reality show The Apprentice . Manigault-Stallworth was born and raised in Youngstown , Ohio , where she attended Rayen High School , before earning a Bachelor 's degree in Broadcast Journalism in 1996 at Central State University in Wilberforce , Ohio , where she was a four year member of the women 's volleyball team . She later moved to Washington , D.C. in order to attend Howard University , where she pursued both a Master 's and Ph. D. in Communications . In 2000 , she married Aaron Stallworth , but the two separated in 2005 , and later divorced . Manigault-Stallworth worked in the office of then Vice President Al Gore during the Clinton Administration as a low-level staffer whose job was answering invitations . According to a People Magazine article she was transferred repeatedly due to her disruptive behavior . In August 2009 , Manigault-Stallworth enrolled in United Theological Seminary in Ohio to pursue a Doctor of Ministry degree . Manigault-Stallworth first came into the spotlight in 2004 after becoming a participant on NBC 's reality TV Series , The Apprentice , produced by Mark Burnett , and starring business mogul Donald Trump . With her controversial behavior , she soon became the `` woman America loved to hate '' and was named by E ! as reality TV 's No. 1 bad girl . However , Manigault-Stallworth claims the show 's producers manipulated the footage to make her look like the villain , and said , `` These shows are constructed . They do n't happen , nor do they portray actual reality . They are constructed reality . '' She added , `` Historically , African-Americans have been portrayed negatively on reality television . We do n't come across well . You 've got to start looking and saying , ` Is that really how all African-Americans are ? ' Because they are trying to say that this is representative of our people . '' Since her participation on the first season of The Apprentice , Manigault-Stallworth has gone on to appear on over 20 other reality shows , including VH1 's fifth season of The Surreal Life , NBC 's Fear Factor and Oxygen 's prank show Girls Behaving Badly . She has also been a guest on nearly every major talk show on TV , including a controversial appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show . It was on Oprah 's show where the often contentious Manigault-Stallworth accused fellow Apprentice participant , Ereka Vetrini , of calling her the `` n-word , '' a claim Vetrini has strenuously denied . In January 2008 , Manigault-Stallworth became the only former Apprentice participant to be invited back to The Celebrity Apprentice , where she quickly became embroiled in a personal feud with Piers Morgan . She was eventually fired in the tenth episode after serving as the project manager of the team that , according to Trump , suffered `` the biggest slaughter in the history of The Apprentice '' in a challenge to sell artwork against a team led by Morgan . In June , 2010 , Manigault-Stallworth and Donald Trump teamed up to create a new dating show called The Ultimate Merger , which included R&B singer\/producer Al B. Sure ! as one of the contestants . The show aired on TV One .

Czech Wikipedia is the Czech language edition of Wikipedia . It was created in November 2002 on a request of a Czech editor of the Esperanto Wikipedia . However , at that time , Wikipedia ran on UseMod software . The three pages the Czech version had at the time were lost during the switch to MediaWiki . The oldest currently available edit is from when the Main Page was recopied on 14 November 2002 . It reached 1000 articles , many about Esperanto topics , on 20 October 2003 . An April 2004 report noted that it had 180 registered users at that time . In June 2005 , the Czech Wikipedia reached 10,000 articles and it reached 20,000 in December of the same year . The Main Page was re-designed with more details after reaching this milestone . By November 2006 , it exceeded 30,000 articles , and became the 21st language version to exceed 100,000 articles in June 2008 . As of March 24 , 2011 there are more than 190,000 articles , 29 administrators , over 144,000 registered users , and dozens of very active contributors . In December 2009 , contributors to the Czech Wikipedia held a conference in Prague . In 2008 , the Czech NGO Wikimedia Ä eskÃ republika ( Wikimedia Czech Republic ) was founded to support the Czech Wikipedia by organizing events , helping communication with authors of free content , and promoting the Czech Wikipedia to the public .
Peter McCallum Dowding SC ( born 6 October 1943 in Melbourne ) was the 24th Premier of Western Australia , serving from 25 February 1988 until his resignation on 12 February 1990 after an internal party dispute . He was educated at three independent schools : Caulfield Grammar School , The Scots College and Hale School , in Melbourne , Sydney and Perth respectively . He earned a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Western Australia in 1964 . Dowding was elected as a member of Western Australia 's Legislative Council for the Australian Labor Party from 1979 to 1986 representing the North Province and , in 1986 , was elected as the member for Maylands in the Legislative Assembly . Having succeeded Brian Burke as premier on 25 February 1988 , during the time known as the WA Inc period , he was involved in unravelling a number of business transactions but , as the Government 's position in the polls deteriorated , he was challenged as premier and resigned on 12 February 1990 , being succeeded by Carmen Lawrence . A royal commission later found that : Mr Dowding , as premier , presided over a disastrous series of decisions designed to support Rothwells when it was or should have been clear to him and to those ministers closely involved that Rothwells was no longer a viable financial institution . This culminated in the decision to involve the Government , through WAGH , in the Kwinana petrochemical project as a means of removing the Government 's contingent liability for certain of the debts of Rothwells . Electoral advantage was preferred to the public interest . Dowding has worked for several law firms during his career , and has specialised as a barrister in the areas of family and native-title law . In 2002 , he was appointed as Senior Counsel in Western Australia . He was a recipient of a Centenary Medal in 2001 .
This article is about the Tibetan Buddhist teacher . Other entries use the acronym MARPA . For the PMA aircraft parts trade association see Modification and Replacement Parts Association . For the radar plotting aid , see Mini Automatic Radar Plotting Aid . Marpa Lotsawa ( 1012 â `` 1097 ) , sometimes known fully as Lhodak Marpa Choski Lodos or commonly as Marpa the Translator , was a Tibetan Buddhist teacher credited with the transmission of many Buddhist teachings to Tibet from India , including the teachings and lineages of Vajrayana and Mahamudra . Born as Marpa ChÃ kyi LodrÃ , in Lhodrak Chukhyer in the southern part of Tibet , to an affluent family , he began studying at a young age but was wild and untamed compared to other children . Marpa first received instruction for three years at Mangkhar with Drokmi Shakya Yeshe and mastered Sanskrit . He decided to travel to India to study with renowned Indian Buddhist masters . Marpa returned home to Lhodrak and converted his entire inheritance into gold to fund his travel expenses and to make offerings to teachers . Marpa journeyed first to Nepal where he studied with Paindapa and Chitherpa , two famous students of Naropa . Paindapa later accompanied Marpa to Pullahari , near Nalanda University , where Naropa taught . Marpa spent twelve years studying with Naropa and other great Indian gurus , most prominently Maitripada . After twelve years he set forth on his journey back to Tibet to teach and continue his dharma activities . Marpa was to travel to India twice more and Nepal three more times and studied with Naropa and other great teachers including Maitripa . On his third visit to India , Naropa , who was engaged in tantric practices , proved difficult to find . However eventually Marpa found him and received the final teachings and instructions from Naropa . It was then that Naropa prophesied that a family lineage would not continue for Marpa , but that his lineage would be carried on by his disciples . Marpa now had received the full transmission , so Naropa formally declared Marpa to be his successor although he had other major disciples including Paindapa , Chitherpa , Shri Shantibhadra or Kukuripa , and Maitripa . Upon his return to Tibet , Marpa spent many years translating Buddhist scriptures and made a major contribution to the transmission of the complete buddhadharma to Tibet . Marpa continued to practice and give teachings and transmissions to many students in Tibet . After his second visit to India Milarepa became his disciple , who inherited his lineage in full . Marpa lived with his wife Dakmema and their sons in Lhodrak in the southern part of Tibet . Marpa is said to have founded Stongdey Monastery in Zanskar in 1052 CE .
The Second Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians , often referred to as Second Corinthians ( and written as 2 Corinthians ) , is the 8th book of the New Testament . The letter , originally written in Koine Greek , is from Paul of Tarsus ( and Timothy ) to the Christians of Corinth . While there is little doubt among scholars that Paul is the author , there is discussion over whether the Epistle was originally one letter or composed from two or more of Paul 's letters . The abrupt change of tone from being previously harmonious to bitterly reproachful in 2 Corinthians 10-13 has led many to speculate that chapters 10-13 form part of the `` letter of tears '' which were in some way tagged on to Paul 's main letter . Those who disagree with this assessment usually say that the `` letter of tears '' is no longer extant . Some scholars also find fragments of the `` warning letter '' , or of other letters , in chapters 1-9 , for instance that part of the `` warning letter '' is preserved in 2 Cor 6:14 -7:1 , but these hypotheses are less popular . In Paulâ s second letter to the Corinthians he again refers to himself as an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God and reassures the people of Corinth will not have another painful visit but what he has to say is not to cause pain but to reassure them the love he has for them . It was shorter in length in comparison to the first and a little confusing if the reader is unaware of the social , religious , and economic situation of the community . Paul felt the situation in Corinth was still complicated and felt attacked . Some challenged his authority as an apostle and compares the level of difficulty to other cities he has visited who had embraced it , like the Galatians . He is criticized for the way he speaks and writes and finds it just to defend himself with some of his important teachings . He states the importance of forgiving others , and Godâ s new agreement that comes from the Spirit of the living God ( 2 Cor . This epistle , it has been well said , shows the individuality of the apostle more than any other . `` Human weakness , spiritual strength , the deepest tenderness of affection , wounded feeling , sternness , irony , rebuke , impassioned self-vindication , humility , a just self-respect , zeal for the welfare of the weak and suffering , as well as for the progress of the church of Christ and for the spiritual advancement of its members , are all displayed in turn in the course of his appeal .

RomÃ o et Juliette ( Romeo and Juliet ) is an opÃ ra in five acts by Charles Gounod to a French libretto by Jules Barbier and Michel CarrÃ , based on The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare . It was first performed at the ThÃ Ã cents tre Lyrique ( ThÃ Ã cents tre-Lyrique ImpÃ rial du ChÃ cents telet ) , Paris on 27 April 1867 . This opera is notable for the series of four duets for the main characters and the waltz song `` Je veux vivre '' for the soprano . Gounod 's opera Faust had become popular at the ThÃ Ã cents tre Lyrique since its premiere in 1859 ( it was performed over 300 times between 1859 and 1868 ) and this led to a further commission from the director Carvalho . Behind the scenes there were difficulties in casting the lead tenor , and Gounod was said to have composed the last act twice , but after the public general rehearsal and first night it was hailed as a major success for the composer . Its success was aided by the presence of dignitaries in Paris for the Exhibition , several of whom attended performances . A parody soon appeared at the ThÃ Ã cents tre DÃ jazet , entitled Rhum et eau en juillet ( Rum and water in July ) . The opera entered the repertoire of the OpÃ ra-Comique on 20 January 1873 ( with Deloffre and Carvalho returning to their roles from the premiere ) , where it received 391 performances in 14 years . On the 28 November 1888 RomÃ o et Juliette transferred to the Paris OpÃ ra , with Adelina Patti and Jean de Reszke in the leading roles . The opera was first seen in London ( with Patti and Mario ) on 11 July 1867 and in New York ( with Minnie Hauk ) at the Academy of Music on 15 November of that year . Sutherland Edwards , music critic of the St. James 's Gazette , wrote the following about the opera following its first performance in London in 1867 : Gounod 's RomÃ o et Juliette , in which the composer is always pleasing , though seldom impressive , might be described as the powerful drama of Romeo and Juliet reduced to the proportions of an eclogue for Juliet and Romeo . One remembers the work as a series of very pretty duets , varied by a sparkling waltz air for Juliet , in which Madame Patti displays that tragic genius , which belongs to her equally , with the highest capacity for comedy . ( Vaccai 's ) Romeo e Giulietta is an admirable opera for Giulietta ; in which Romeo is not forgotten . The libretto follows the story of Shakespeare 's play . A short chorus sets the scene of the rival families in Verona . Tybalt talks to Paris about Juliette , who appears with her father . RomÃ o , Mercutio , Benvolio and their friends enter , disguised , and Mercutio sings a ballad about Queen Mab , after which Juliette sings a joyful waltz song . The first meeting between RomÃ o and Juliette takes place , and they fall in love . But Tybalt re-appears and suspects that the hastily re-masked RomÃ o is his rival . While Tybalt wants immediate revenge , Capulet orders that the ball continue . After RomÃ o 's page Stephano has helped his master gain access , he reveals the two young lovers exchanging their vows of love . RomÃ o and Juliette , accompanied by Gertrude , go to the cell , and the wedding takes place . Laurent hopes that reconciliation between the houses of the Montagus and the Capulets may thus take place . Stephano sings to attract the occupants into the street . Gregoire and Stephano skirmish as men from each family appear . The duel is first between Tybalt and Mercutio , who falls dead , and then between RomÃ o , determined to avenge his comrade , and Tybalt . Tybalt is killed by RomÃ o , who is banished by the Duke . RomÃ o and Juliette are together and , after a long duet , RomÃ o departs for exile . Juliette 's father comes to remind her of Tybalt 's dying wish for Juliette to marry Count Paris . The friar gives Juliette a draught which will cause her to sleep , so as to appear as if dead and , after being laid in the family tomb , it is planned that RomÃ o will awaken her and take her away . ( A ballet scene in the grand hall of the palace was inserted at this point . ) RomÃ o breaks into the tomb after having taken poison because he believes that Juliette is dead . When she awakes from the friarâ s potion , the lovers ' last duet is heard before the poison takes effect on RomÃ o. As her bridegroom weakens Juliette stabs herself , to be united with her lover in death .

The city of Lincoln was founded in 1907 , and recently hosted a centennial celebration in July 2007 . Lincoln is also home to the Arkansas Country Doctor Museum , which includes a collection of medical instruments and personal artifacts from the 1930 to 1960 . Lincoln Elementary School , Lincoln Middle School , Lincoln High School , and Lincoln Academic Center of Excellent make up the Lincoln Consolidated School District . The school mascot is the Wolf . The school colors are maroon and white . In 2007 , the Lincoln Cheerleading team won the State Championship in Little Rock , Arkansas .
Class 80 was the TOPS classification allocated by British Rail to the prototype 25 kV AC electric locomotive . This locomotive was built by Metropolitan-Vickers , initially as a prototype Gas turbine-electric locomotive , numbered 18100 . British Rail allocated the number E1000 ( and later E2001 ) to the locomotive following its conversion from gas turbine propulsion . Its new electric propulsion meant it was rated at 2500hp , giving a maximum speed of 90mph and weighing 109 tons . In addition , it was also converted from Co-Co to A1A-A1A wheel arrangement when the center traction motor from each bogie was removed . The new traction motor rating ( with four motors ) was about the same as the original rating ( with six motors ) . This suggests that new traction motors were fitted . The conversion of the locomotive began in January 1958 when the locomotive was moved from storage at Dukinfield Works to the Bowesfield Works at Stockton-on-Tees . The work involved the removal of the gas turbine unit , main generator , fuel tank , air filters , the center traction motor from each bogie and all of the ancillary equipment used for the gas turbine unit . Once the locomotive had been stripped , the new electrical equipment was installed which included the transformer , the Stone-Faiveley Pantograph ( for which a section of the roof had to be lowered ) , a Brown Boveri air blast circuit breaker and the Hackbridge-Hewittic mercury arc rectifier units . The cabs of the locomotive were converted from Western Region right-hand drive to the standard British Rail left-hand drive arrangement . The rebuilt locomotive was completed and ready for trials in October 1958 . It retained its original BR black livery , with a silver stripe around the middle of the body and silver numbers . The locomotive was used to prepare the ground for the 25kV AC electrification being installed on the West Coast Main Line , including the testing of overhead line equipment and staff training . Once the production locomotives ( Class 81 onwards ) were in service , E2001 was no longer required . It was put into store at the end of 1961 , and lasted for over ten years at various locations . It was officially withdrawn in April 1968 and scrapped in November 1972 at J Cashmore in Great Bridge .
Year 1630 ( MDCXXX ) was a common year starting on Tuesday ( link will display the full calendar ) of the Gregorian calendar and a common year starting on Friday of the 10-day slower Julian calendar .
Authie is a commune in the Calvados department in the Basse-Normandie region in northwestern France .
The nasal cavity ( or nasal fossa ) is a large air filled space above and behind the nose in the middle of the face . The nasal cavity conditions the air to be received by the other areas of the respiratory tract . Owing to the large surface area provided by the nasal conchae , the air passing through the nasal cavity is warmed or cooled to within 1 degree of body temperature . In addition , the air is humidified , and dust and other particulate matter is removed by vibrissae , short , thick hairs , present in the vestibule . The cilia of the respiratory epithelium move the particulate matter towards the pharynx where it passes into the esophagus and is digested in the stomach . The lateral wall of the nasal cavity is mainly made up by the maxilla , however there is a deficiency that is compensated by : the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone , the medial pterygoid plate , the labyrinth of the ethmoid and the inferior concha . The nasal cavity is enclosed by the nasal bone above . The floor of the nasal cavity , which forms the roof of the mouth , is made up by the bones of the hard palate : the horizontal plate of the palatine bone posteriorly and the palatine process of the maxilla anteriorly . To the front of the nasal cavity is the nose , while the back blends , via the choanae , into the nasopharynx . The paranasal sinuses are connected to the nasal cavity through small orifices called ostia . The nasal cavity is divided in two by a vertical fin called the nasal septum . On the sides of the nasal cavity are three horizontal outgrowths called nasal conchae ( singular `` concha '' ) or turbinates . These turbinates disrupt the airflow , directing air toward the olfactory epithelium on the surface of the turbinates and the septum . The vomeronasal organ is located at the back of the septum and has a role in pheromone detection . Cilia and mucus along the inside wall of the nasal cavity trap and remove dust and pathogens from the air as it flows through the nasal cavity . The cilia move the mucus down the nasal cavity to the pharynx , where it can be swallowed . The nasal cavity is divided into two segments : the respiratory segment and the olfactory segment . There is a rich blood supply to the nasal cavity . In some animals , such as dogs , the capillary beds flowing through the nasal cavity help cool the blood flow to the brain . Blood supply comes from branches of both the internal and external carotid artery , including branches of the facial artery and maxillary artery . The named arteries of the nose are : Innervation of the nasal cavity responsible for the sense of smell is via the olfactory nerve , which sends microscopic fibers from the olfactory bulb through the cribiform plate to reach the top of the nasal cavity . There are two passages in the nasal cavity , not to be confused with nostrils . The entire nasal cavity is innervated by autonomic fibers . Sympathetic innervation to the blood vessels of the mucosa causes them to constrict , while the control of secretion by the mucous glands is carried on postganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers originating from the facial nerve . Diseases of the nasal cavity include viral , bacterial and fungal infections , nasal cavity tumors , both benign and much more often malign , as well as inflammations of the nasal mucosa .
Sodium telluride is the chemical compound with the formula Na2Te . This salt is the conjugate base of the thermally unstable acid hydrogen telluride , but it is usually prepared by reduction of tellurium with sodium . Na2Te is a challenging material to handle because it is very sensitive to air . Air oxidizes it initially to polytellurides , which have the formula Na2Tex ( x ) 1 ) , and ultimately Te metal . Samples of Na2Te , which are colourless when absolutely pure , generally appear purple or gray due to the effects of air oxidation . The synthesis is typically conducted using ammonia as the solvent . Na2Te , like many related compounds with the formula M2X , adopts the antifluorite structure . Thus , in solid Na2Te each Te2 â ' ion is surrounded by eight Na + ions and each Na + ion is surrounded by four Te2 â ' ions . Simple salts of the type M2X , where X is a monoatomic anion , are not typically soluble in any solvent because they have a high lattice energy . Upon addition of water - even moist air - or treatment with alcohols , Te2 â ' protonates : Na2Te + H2O NaHTe + NaOH Because of this reaction , many processes attributed to Na2Te may involve NaHTe ( CAS # 65312-92-7 ) , which is more soluble and formed readily . Na2Te finds use in organic synthesis , both as a reagent for reductions and as a source of Te in the synthesis of organotellurium compounds . Aryl halides are substituted to diaryl tellurides , as illustrated by the synthesis of dinaphthyltelluride : As a reducing agent , Na2Te converts nitro groups to amines and will cleave certain C-X bonds .
The small island of Pianosa , about in area , forms part of Italy 's Tuscan Archipelago . Its name comes from the Italian pianura ( plain ) . Its highest point stands 22 m above sea level . Pianosa is part of the Elba island municipality . On clear days , Elbans see Pianosa as a dark blue line over the lighter blue sea . Pianosa was the site of a maximum-security prison ( 1858 â `` 1998 ) , in later years holding especially dangerous Mafia criminals , although the island is not now inhabited for the whole year . It is part of the National Park of the Tuscan Archipelago . It is a Marine Protected Area â '' no fishing , diving or anchoring is allowed without special permit . During tourist season it is connected by boat to Elba . Cell phones do not work on the island . The island was first inhabited in the Upper Palaeolithic ( the Late Stone Age ) . The ancient Romans ' Planasia had buildings including a theater and catacombs on two levels . It was extensively cultivated by the Romans . It became noted in history when the princeps Augustus banished his grandson and ex-heir Agrippa Postumus there in AD 6 or 7 . Postumus remained there until his execution around the death of Augustus in 14 . In the Middle Ages the island 's ownership was disputed by Pisa and Genova . In 1399 , it became part of Piombino . There were small colonies during fishing season in the following centuries , as well as several military strongholds . Although it was once densely wooded , according to 18th century documents , humans and the animals they brought have destroyed the trees on the island , which is now largely grassland . Joseph Heller 's absurdist novel Catch-22 is set on a U.S. Army Air Corps bomber squadron base on Pianosa during World War II , but Heller conceded that he took literary license in making Pianosa big enough for a major military complex . Heller 's island also has a small community of Italian villagers , unlike the real island . Another , even smaller , island called Pianosa lies off the Adriatic coast of Italy , north of Monte Gargano .
Jorge Pinto de MendonÃ a ( June 6 , 1954 -- February 17 , 2006 ) was a Brazilian footballer most famous during 1970s and 1980s , playing in a striker role . Born in Silva Jardim , he scored 375 goals during his career ( 1971 -- 1990 ) . With Brazilian team he played 6 games without scoring any goals ( he was Zico reserve in 1978 FIFA World Cup ) . He won the SÃ # o Paulo State Championship in 1976 and was the top goalscorer in the same tournament in 1981 . After he retired he suffered of most problems financiary and familiar . In his last year he directed a project hospital children of Guarani . He died at 51 years old from a heart attack in Campinas .
A shovel is a tool for digging , lifting , and moving bulk materials , such as soil , coal , gravel , snow , sand , or ore. . Shovels are extremely common tools that are used extensively in agriculture , construction , and gardening . Most shovels are hand tools consisting of a broad blade with edges or sides that is fixed to a medium-length handle . Shovel blades are usually made of sheet steel or hard plastics and are very strong . Shovel handles are usually made of wood ( especially specific varieties such as ash or maple ) or glass-reinforced plastic ( fibreglass ) . Hand shovel blades made of sheet steel usually have a folded seam or hem at the back to make a socket for the handle . This fold also commonly provides extra rigidity to the blade . The handles are usually riveted in place . A T-piece is commonly fitted to the end of the handle to aid grip and control where the shovel is designed for moving soil and heavy materials . These designs can all be easily mass-produced . The term shovel is also applied to larger excavating machines called power shovels , which are designed for the same purpose , namely , digging , lifting , and moving material . Modern power shovels are the descendants of steam shovels . Loaders and excavators ( such as backhoes ) perform very similar work , etically speaking , but they are not classified as shovels emically . Hand shovels have been adapted for many different tasks and environments . They can be optimized for a single task or designed as cross-over or compromise multitaskers . Examples are given under `` Types '' . In neolithic times and earlier a large animal 's scapula ( shoulder blade ) was often used as a crude shovel . Manual shoveling ( often in combination with picking ) was the chief means of excavation in construction until mechanization via steam shovels and later hydraulic equipment ( excavators such as backhoes and loaders ) gradually replaced most manual shoveling . The same is also true of the history of mining and quarrying and of bulk materials handling in industries such as steelmaking and stevedoring . Railroad cars and cargo holds containing ore , coal , gravel , sand , or grains were often loaded and unloaded this way . These industries did not always rely exclusively on such work , but such work was a ubiquitous part of them . Until the 1950s , manual shoveling employed large numbers of workers . Groups of workers called labor gangs were assigned to whatever digging or bulk materials handling was needed in any given week , and dozens or hundreds of workers with hand shovels would do the kind of rapid excavating or materials handling that today is usually accomplished with powered excavators and loaders operated by a few skilled operators . Thus the cost of labor , even when each individual worker was poorly paid , was a tremendous expense of operations . Productivity of the business was tied mostly to labor productivity . It still often is even today ; but in the past it was even more so . In industrial and commercial materials handling , hand shoveling was later replaced not only with loaders and backhoes ( as in excavating ) but also with electrically actuated equipment such as conveyors , augers , and elevators . Given the central importance and cost of manual labor in industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the ( applied ) `` science of shoveling '' was something of great interest to developers of scientific management such as Frederick Winslow Taylor . Taylor , with his focus on time and motion study , took an interest in differentiating the many motions of manual labor to a far greater degree than others tended to . Managers might not care to analyze it ( figuring that brute work is brute work , case closed ) , and workers might not care to analyze it in any way that encouraged management to take away the prerogative in craft work for the craftsman to decide the details of his methods . Taylor realized that failing to analyze shoveling practice represented a missed opportunity to discover or synthesize best practices for shoveling , which could achieve highest productivity ( value for dollar spent ) . It was Taylor and colleagues in the 1890s through 1910s that greatly expanded the existing idea of varied shovel designs with different-sized scoops , one for each material , based on the material 's density . Under scientific management , it was no longer acceptable to use the same shovel for shoveling brown coal one day and gravel the next . Taylor advocated the higher capital cost of maintaining two shovels as more than paying for itself through the increase in worker productivity that it would lead to , which would mean less money being spent on wages for each unit of shoveling work accomplished . Unfortunately , despite Taylor 's valid insights about the possibility for applying science to manual labor ( including shoveling and the lifting and carrying of heavy objects ) and his valid insights about the inequality of talents between individuals , he did not really respect the human dignity of all workers , and tended to be contemptuous of people with low intelligence . The science of shoveling ( that is , hand shoveling ) has long since mostly faded out of commercial concern thanks to extensive mechanization , such as bulldozers and other equipment . Humans are once again mostly content to let one coal scoop handle various bulk materials of differing densities .
The Shapiro time delay effect , or gravitational time delay effect , is one of the four classic solar system tests of general relativity . Radar signals passing near a massive object take slightly longer to travel to a target and longer to return than it would if the mass of the object were not present . The time delay effect was first noticed in 1964 , by Irwin I. Shapiro . Shapiro proposed an observational test of his prediction : bounce radar beams off the surface of Venus and Mercury , and measure the round trip travel time . When the Earth , Sun , and Venus are most favorably aligned , Shapiro showed that the expected time delay , due to the presence of the Sun , of a radar signal traveling from the Earth to Venus and back , would be about 200 microseconds , well within the limitations of 1960s era technology . The first tests , performed in 1966 and 1967 using the MIT Haystack radar antenna , were successful , matching the predicted amount of time delay . The experiments have been repeated many times since then , with increasing accuracy . In a near-statical gravitational field of moderate strength ( say , of stars and planets , but not one of a black hole or close binary system of neutron stars ) the effect may be considered as a special case of gravitational time dilation . The speed of light in meters per given interval of `` local time '' ( calculated by the metric tensor ) is a constant , however the travel time of any electromagnetic wave , or signal , moving at 299,792,458 meters per `` second '' is affected by the time dilation in regions of the space through which it travels . This is because the coordinate time and locally calculated time diverge as the gravitational field potential increases ( by absolute value ) . is the unit vector pointing from the observer to the gravitating mass M. See Dot product . which is the extra distance the light has to travel , where is the Schwarzschild radius . Shapiro delay must be considered along with ranging data when trying to accurately determine the distance to interplanetary probes such as the Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft ( see the Voyager program , the Pioneer program , and the Pioneer anomaly ) . `` In the second place our result shows that , according to the general theory of relativity , the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuum , which constitutes one of the two fundamental assumptions in the special theory of relativity and to which we have already frequently referred , can not claim any unlimited validity . A curvature of rays of light can only take place when the velocity of propagation of light varies with position . Now we might think that as a consequence of this , the special theory of relativity and with it the whole theory of relativity would be laid in the dust . But in reality this is not the case . We can only conclude that the special theory of relativity can not claim an unlimited domain of validity ; its results hold only so long as we are able to disregard the influences of gravitational fields on the phenomena ( e.g. of light ) . '' â `` Albert Einstein ( The General Theory of Relativity : Chapter 22 â `` A Few Inferences from the General Principle of Relativity ) From the near-simultaneous observations of neutrinos and photons from SN 1987A , we know that the Shapiro delay for high-energy neutrinos is the same as that for photons to within 10 % ( consistent with recent estimates of the neutrino mass which imply that those neutrinos were moving at very close to the speed of light ) . Since gravitational waves have not been directly detected , we do n't have any data on the Shapiro delay for gravitational waves . In general relativity and other metric theories of gravity , the Shapiro delay for gravitational waves is expected to be same as that for light ( and neutrinos ) . However in theories such as Teves and other modified GR theories which reproduce Milgrom 's law and avoid the need for dark matter , the Shapiro delay for gravitational waves is much smaller than that for neutrinos or photons .
The last 25 years , the lowest temperature was -9 Â C and the highest was 43 Â C. Larderello is a frazione of the comune of Pomarance , in Tuscany in central Italy . It is a geologically active area , renowned for its geothermal productivity . The region has experienced occasional phreatic volcanic eruptions , caused by explosive outbursts of steam trapped below the surface . It possesses a dozen explosion craters 30-250 m in diameter . The largest is the Lago Vecchienna crater , now filled by a lake , which last erupted around 1282 . Larderello now produces 10 % of the world 's entire supply of geothermal electricity , amounting to 4,800 GWh per year and powering about a million Italian households . Its geology makes it uniquely conducive to geothermal power production , with hot granite rocks lying unusually close to the surface , producing steam as hot as 220 Â C ( 396 Â F ) . The region was known from ancient times for its volcanic nature and exceptionally hot springs . The Romans used its sulphur springs for bathing . Known as Montecerboli until the 19th century , it became one of the first places in the world where geothermal energy was exploited to support industry . In 1827 FranÃ ois de Larderel , a Frenchman , invented a way of extracting boric acid from the volcanic mud by using steam to heat cauldrons to separate the two . Leopold II , Grand Duke of Tuscany was an enthusiastic supporter of Larderel 's scheme and awarded him the title of Count of Montecerboli a decade later . A town , named Larderello in honor of Larderel 's work , was founded to house the workers in the boric acid production factory . The region was the site of a pioneering experiment in the production of energy from geothermal sources in 1904 , when five light bulbs were lit by electricity produced through steam emerging from vents in the ground - the first ever practical demonstration of geothermal power . Prince Piero Ginori Conti tested the first geothermal power generator on 4 July 1904 , at the Larderello dry steam field in Italy . It was a small generator that lit four light bulbs . Later , in 1911 , the world 's first geothermal power plant was built there . In 1911 , the world 's first geothermal power plant was built in the Valle del Diavolo ( `` Devil 's Valley '' ) , named for the boiling water that rises there . It was the world 's only industrial producer of geothermal electricity until 1958 , when New Zealand built a plant of its own in Wairakei .
A micrometre is one-millionth of a metre ( 1\/1000 of a millimetre , or 0.001 mm ) . Its unit symbol in the International System of Units ( SI ) is Î 1\/4 m. The term micron and the symbol Î 1\/4 , representing the micrometre were officially accepted between 1879 and 1967 , but officially revoked in 1967 . In practice it is still used , especially in American English , astronomy , and the semiconductor industry . The micrometre is a common unit of measurement for wavelengths of infrared radiation . The use of the term micron also helps differentiate the unit from the measuring device of the same name . A single strand of hair usually has a diameter of 20 to 180 Î 1\/4 m. Red blood cells are approximately 8 Î 1\/4 m in diameter .
In geology , a supercontinent is a landmass comprising more than one continental core , or craton . The assembly of cratons and accreted terranes that form Eurasia qualifies as a supercontinent today . Most commonly , paleogeographers employ the term supercontinent to refer to a single landmass consisting of all the modern continents . The earliest known supercontinent was Vaalbara . It formed from proto-continents and was a supercontinent by 3.1 billion years ago ( 3.1 Ga ) . Vaalbara broke up ~ 2.8 Ga ago . The supercontinent Kenorland was formed ~ 2.7 Ga ago and then broke sometime after 2.5 Ga into the proto-continent Cratons called Laurentia , Baltica , Australia , and Kalahari . The supercontinent Columbia or Nuna formed during a period of 2.0 -- 1.8 billion years and broke up about 1.5 -- 1.3 billion years ago . The supercontinent Rodinia formed about 1.1 billion years ago and broke up roughly 750 million years ago . One of the fragments included large parts of the continents now located in the southern hemisphere . Plate tectonics brought the fragments of Rodinia back together in a different configuration during the late Paleozoic era about 300 million years ago , forming the best-known supercontinent , Pangaea . Pangaea subsequently broke up into the northern and southern supercontinents , Laurasia and Gondwana , about 200 million years ago . The continental lithosphere is 80 â thick . When continents rift into separate plates , the thicker lithosphere gives way to thinner lithosphere of the oceans . Also , the transition from a continental rift to an oceanic rift is accompanied by block faulting , where blocks of continental crust drop down along extensional faults where the crust is being pulled apart . This results in a deep rift valley and a thinning of the crust . The African rift valley is an active rifting event . Rifting of a continent begins with hot-spot volcanism at rift valleys . Hot spots burn holes through the crust and cause it to weaken . The crust under a rift is only 30 â thick . Because the continental crust is so much thicker than the oceanic crust , it conducts heat less efficiently , making it function like an insulating blanket . If a supercontinent covers a portion of the earthâ s surface where heat from the mantle accumulates under the crust , it causes the land mass to dome upward . This creates a superswell . The continued bulging causes supercontinents to rift apart with individual , broken-off continents sliding off the superswell . The continents then move toward colder sinking regions in the mantle and become stranded over cool downflows of mantle rock . After the continents are separated , heat from the mantle is more easily conducted through the newly formed ocean basin . After so much heat has escaped , the continents halt their outward progress and begin to return to their places of origin . The landmasses surrounding the Pacific Basin apparently have not undergone continental collision . The Pacific Basin has narrowed and widened in response to the continental breakup dispersal and reconvergence in the area of the Atlantic Ocean . When todayâ s continents have reached their maximum dispersal ( millions of years from now ) , the crust of the Atlantic Ocean bordering the continents will grow dense enough to sink into the mantle ; creating subduction zones around the Atlantic Basin . This subduction into the mantle will begin the process of closing the Atlantic Basin . Eventually all continents will rejoin into another supercontinent over a large mantle downflow and the cycle of dispersal and rejoining will begin again . The cycle of rifting and patching repeats itself roughly every 450 million years .
Nobuyuki Abe was a general in the Imperial Japanese Army , Governor-General of Korea , and 36th Prime Minister of Japan from August 30 , 1939 to January 16 , 1940 . Abe was born into an ex-samurai family in Kanazawa city , Ishikawa Prefecture . His brother-in-law was Imperial Japanese Navy admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue . Abe attended Tokyo No. 1 Middle School ( Tokyo Metropolitan Hibiya High School ) followed by No. 4 High School . While still a student , he volunteered for military service during the First Sino-Japanese War . After the war , Abe graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy followed by the 19th class of the Army War College . Ultranationalist General Araki Sadao was one of his classmates . Abe became commander of the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment from 1918-1921 . In August 1918 , his regiment was sent to Siberia during Japan 's Siberian Intervention , but was never in combat . Abe was appointed commander of the 4th Infantry Division on December 22 , 1930 . He later served as instructor in the Army War College followed by chief of the Military Affairs Bureau and as Vice Minister of the Army . In 1933 , Abe was promoted to full general and became Commander in Chief of the Taiwan Army . In 1936 , he was placed on the reserve list . Abe Nobuyuki was not the obvious first choice as Prime Minister after the collapse of the Hiranuma Kiichiro cabinet . From the civilian side , Konoe Fumimaro or Hirota Koki were regarded as front-runners ; however the Army and the ultranationalists strongly supported General Ugaki Kazushige . After genrÅ Saionji Kinmochi declared his disinterest in any of the candidates , the Army was poised to have its way . However , Ugaki fell ill and was hospitalized . The interim War Minister General Abe Nobuyuki was a compromise . Abe had the advantage of belonging to neither the Toseiha nor the Kodoha political factions within the Army and was also supported as a relative political moderate by the Imperial Japanese Navy ; on the other hand he was despised by many senior Army officers for his total lack of any combat experience . Abe became Prime Minister on August 30 , 1939 . He concurrently held the portfolio of Foreign Minister during his term in office . During his short four month tenure , Abe sought to quickly end the Second Sino-Japanese War , and to maintain Japan 's neutrality in the growing European conflict . He was also opposed to efforts by elements within the Army to form a political-military alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy . Lacking in support from either the military or the political parties , Abe was replaced by Mitsumasa Yonai in January 1940 . Three months later after his replacement as Prime Minister , the Army sent Abe sent as a special envoy to China to advise the Japanese-supported regime of Wang Jingwei in Nanjing , and to negotiate a treaty ensuring Japanese economic and military rights in northern China . After his return to Japan , Abe joined the House of Peers in 1942 , and accepted the largely ceremonial position as president of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association . He was appointed the 10th ( and last ) Governor-General of Korea in 1944 and 1945 . After World War II , Abe was purged from public office , and arrested by the American occupation government . However , he was not charged with any war crimes and was soon released . His second son was Nobuhiro Abe .
If P , then Q. Not Q. Therefore , not P. It can also be referred to as denying the consequent , and is a valid form of argument , unlike similarly named but invalid arguments such as affirming the consequent or denying the antecedent . Modus tollens is sometimes confused with proof by contradiction or proof by contrapositive . Evidence of absence applies modus tollens . A related valid form of argument is modus ponens . where represents the logical assertion . though since the rule does not change the set of assumptions , this is not strictly necessary . ( `` P is a subset of Q. x is not in Q. Therefore , x is not in P. '' ) ( `` For any x if x is P then x is Q. Some object x is such that x is not Q. Therefore , some object x is not P. '' ) Strictly speaking these are not instances of modus tollens , but they may be derived using modus tollens using a few extra steps . The argument has two premises . The first premise is the conditional `` if-then '' statement , namely that P implies Q. The second premise is that Q is false . From these two premises , it can be logically concluded that P must be false . If the watch-dog detects an intruder , the dog will bark . `` The dog did nothing in the night-time . '' Therefore , no intruder was detected by the watch-dog . Supposing that the premises are both true ( the dog will bark if it detects an intruder , and does indeed not bark ) , it follows then that no intruder has been detected . This is a valid argument since it is not possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false . ( It is conceivable that there may be have been an intruder that the dog did not detect , but that does not invalidate the argument ; the first premise goes '' if the watch-dog detects an intruder . '' The thing of importance is that the dog detects or does n't detect an intruder , not if there is one . ) If I am the axe murderer , then I used an axe . I can not use an axe . Therefore , I am not the axe murderer . Modus tollens became well known when it was used by Karl Popper in his proposed response to the problem of induction , falsificationism . However , here the use of modus tollens is much more controversial , as `` truth '' or `` falsity '' are inappropriate concepts to apply to theories ( which are generally approximations to reality ) and experimental findings ( whose interpretation is often contingent on other theories ) . Every use of modus tollens can be converted to a use of modus ponens and one use of transposition to the premise which is a material implication . For example : If P , then Q. ( premise -- material implication ) If Q is false , then P is false . ( derived by transposition ) Q is false . ( premise ) Therefore , P is false . ( derived by modus ponens ) Likewise , every use of modus ponens can be converted to a use of modus tollens and transposition . The validity of modus tollens can be clearly demonstrated through a truth table . In instances of modus tollens we assume as premises that p â ' q is true and q is false . There is only one line of the truth table - the fourth line - which satisfies these two conditions . In this line , p is false . Therefore , in every instance in which p â ' q is true and q is false , p must also be false .

Narita Airport Station is a train station located beneath Terminal 1 of Narita International Airport in Narita , Chiba Prefecture , Japan . The station is shared between East Japan Railway Company ( JR East ) and Keisei Electric Railway . This station has a Midori no Madoguchi ticket office . Keisei has two island platforms : one serves one track ( No. 1 ) and the other serves two . Each of the two tracks of the latter has two positions for trains , which are separately numbered ( one is numbered 2 and 4 , and the other is 3 and 5 ) . On July 17 , 2010 , the Keisei Line platforms and concourses were segregated : one portion is for Sky Access trains ( including Skyliner ) and the other portion will be for Keisei Main Line trains . Passengers not using the Sky Access Line must pass through a second ticket barrier prior to entering the platforms . The purpose for this is to enforce the separate fare structure that will be in place for Sky Access trains . Originally built for the planned Narita Shinkansen , the station opened on 19 March 1991 . Before this , there was also a station named Narita Airport Station , which was served only by Keisei and connected with the airport terminal by bus . The former station was renamed Higashi-Narita Station on the same day the present airport station was opened . ã On July 17 , 2010 , the same day that Skyliner trains began operations on the Narita Sky Access Line , the layout of Keisei Line platforms and concourses was changed . For details , see `` Station layout '' section above .
Puerto Cabezas ( Bilwi in Miskito ) is a municipality in , and capital of , the North Atlantic Coast department ( RegiÃ n AutÃ noma del AtlÃ ntico Norte ) of Nicaragua .

Dr. Phil is a reality\/talk television show hosted by Phil McGraw . After McGraw 's success with his segments on The Oprah Winfrey Show , Dr. Phil debuted on September 16 , 2002 . On both shows McGraw offers advice in the form of `` life strategies '' from his life experience as a clinical psychologist . The show is in syndication throughout the United States and a number of other countries . The show 's syndication contracts specifically state that if Dr. Phil is on another station , it can not air at the same time as Oprah . Its ninth season premiered on September 13 , 2009 . The show is to be renewed through 2014 , or twelve seasons . Occasional prime time specials have aired on CBS . The program has been nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award every year since 2004 . Since September 8 , 2008 , Dr. Phil has been broadcast in HDTV with a revamped look and a new theme written and performed by McGraw 's son , Jordan . The show covers a wide variety of topics , including weight loss , financial planning , errant children , gift suggestions , children who have been diagnosed with autism , unhappily married couples , rebellious teenagers , mothers who dress far from their age , mothers who refuse to attend weddings , children being stars in their parents ' rights , dysfunctional families , mothers who refuse to give their married sons monies and support for charitable causes . Radio personality and ex-child star Danny Bonaduce , came to the show twice in a year to discuss his failing marriage ( and later divorce ) with Gretchen . On several shows , children and\/or adults have taken a lie detector exam . The show is generally serious in tone , leavened with humor from time to time . It has its occasional tense moments and often trashy scenes , like that of The Montel Williams Show , but without melees or aggressive fights on stage , in contrast to The Jerry Springer Show , The Steve Wilkos Show or Maury . He is noted for often bringing back families for multiple shows for follow-up `` therapy '' sessions in his segment called `` Dr. Phil Family . '' Generally , the program is filmed and guests appear in studio , but in 2006 , the Dr. Phil House began as an occasional series . McGraw and his production staff invite guests to a special house wired with numerous cameras and microphones . There , his staff monitor the conversations of the guests he is trying to help , and intervene as necessary to prevent physical violence . McGraw also provides on-the-spot advice and counseling to the `` house guests '' . This format of Dr. Phil is when McGraw sits down with people that are having big problems in the news the week the show airs . The `` Now '' episodes have a set with a desk like a news center , and open with another type of music ( `` breaking news '' music ) . It has the same dynamic . Themes have included rapists , criminals , or Hollywood stars ' issues . One episode included Britney Spears and her 2008 divorce and child custody battle . The show 's slogan is If it 's happening now , we 're going to deal with it now .

Mount Agung or Gunung Agung is a mountain in Bali , Indonesia . This stratovolcano is the highest point on the island . It dominates the surrounding area influencing the climate . The clouds come from the west and Agung takes their water so that the west is lush and green and the east dry and barren . The Balinese believe that Mount Agung is a replica of Mount Meru , the central axis of the universe . One legend holds that the mountain is a fragment of Meru brought to Bali by the first Hindus . The most important temple on Bali , Pura Besakih , is located high on the slopes of Gunung Agung . Gunung Agung last erupted in 1963-64 and is still active , with a large and very deep crater which occasionally belches smoke and ash . From a distance , the mountain appears to be perfectly conical , despite the existence of the large crater . From the peak of the mountain , it is possible to see the peak of Mount Rinjani on the island of Lombok , although both mountains are frequently covered in clouds . On February 18 , 1963 , local residents heard loud explosions and saw clouds rising from the crater of Mount Agung . On February 24 , lava began flowing down the northern slope of the mountain , eventually traveling 7 km in the next 20 days . On March 17 , the volcano erupted ( VEI 5 ) , sending debris 8 â `` 10 km into the air and generating massive pyroclastic flows . These flows devastated numerous villages , killing approximately 1500 people . Cold lahars caused by heavy rainfall after the eruption killed an additional 200 . A second eruption on flows which killed another 200 inhabitants . The lava flows missed , sometimes by mere yards , the Mother Temple of Besakih . The saving of the temple is regarded by the Balinese people as miraculous and a signal from the gods that they wished to demonstrate their power but not destroy the monument the Balinese faithful had erected . There are two routes up the mountain , one from Besakih which proceeds to a higher peak and starts at approximately 1100 m and another which commences higher from Pura Pasar Agung , on the southern slope of the mountain , near Selat and which is reputed to take four hours . There is no path between the two routes at the top . Cecilie Scott provides an account of the ascent from Pura Pasar Agung . Greg Slayden describes a climb from Besakih claimed to have taken a remarkable four and a half hours to the peak and Ken Taylor that took much longer and which included getting lost . Guides are available in Besakih and the mountain can also be climbed without a guide . The climb from Besakih is quite tough . It is sometimes tackled as a single climb generally starting about 10.00 pm for a dawn arrival at the peak and sometimes with an overnight camp about three quarters of the way up . It is far harder than the more popular Balinese climb up Gunung Batur . It is not a mountain that needs ropes and not quite high enough for altitude sickness but adverse weather conditions develop quickly and warm waterproof clothing is required and should be carried . There is no water available along the route . Proceed through the temple complex then continue on a path that travels continuously upwards on a steep narrow spur through open forest and jungle most of the way . There is little potential to get lost until the route opens up towards the top where the correct route doubles backwards . Many climbers miss this turn and continue up a small valley which can be climbed out of with some difficulty .
Eye for Eye ( 1987 ) is a science fiction novella by Orson Scott Card . It first appeared in the March 1987 issue of Asimov 's Science Fiction magazine . In 1990 it appeared in Cardâ s short story collection Maps in a Mirror and also as a Tor double novel , with The Tunesmith by Lloyd Biggle , Jr. . It won the Hugo Award for Best Novella in 1988 . Mick Winger has an unusual gift and with it has accidentally killed several people . When Mick gets angry at people , his power manifests itself by launching an attack upon them by giving them cancer , leukemia or related terminal illnesses . If made angry enough , his anger can outright kill the victim . Mick was raised in an orphanage and along his journey to manhood unintentionally killed several people who mistreated him , as well as nearly everyone he loved , though nearly every occurrence was accidental . The only intentional murder he describes while growing up is being nearly molested in a Denny 's bathroom . This is when he discovers the intensity of the attacks are greatly heightened when he 's touching a target . When fifteen , he fled child custody and set out on his own . When Mick becomes angry , he gets , as he describes it , `` sparkly . '' He can see sparks surrounding and enveloping him and then those sparks lashing out on the object of his anger . Unavoidably , those attacked by his `` sparks '' end up with terminal illnesses and soon die . The effect of his attack is much more pronounced if he is touching the victim . Until he was a young man , Mick had no idea he was different from other children . He discovered he was different when describing `` sparkiness '' with other children , who had no idea what he was talking about . Soon after setting out on his own , he encounters a young woman who not only knows about his gift , but who even seems to possess the same gift , although to a lesser extent . She however possesses the ability to `` call , '' to influence Mick so that he unintentionally heads straight for her , as well as intense sexual attraction , which she describes as simple pheromones that all people have , except that people like Mick , due to a different biochemical makeup ( though Mick does n't understand this when it is first explained to him ) , is far more susceptible to these pheromones than a normal human being . Eventually he is led back to his birth parents , who are members of a mysterious , secluded colony . Talking to his parents , who also possess his ability , he learns he is far more powerful than they or probably anyone else at the colony . Mick learns that what he sees as `` sparks '' his family only sees as dust ; he even begins to realize that he can see when people are lying . After being brought to the villages Patriarch , Papa Lem , Mick learns the intent of the colony and how they operate . Mick then refuses to `` spread his seed '' with the daughter of Papa Lem and returns to his parent 's house for the night . During the night , Mick is attacked by an agent of Papa Lem and others from the village . Mick ends up killing his father and setting fire to the village while at the same time learning new extents to his abilities . After fleeing the village on foot , Mick runs into the girl he met when he first set out on his own . The assailants from the village quickly catch up with the duo and start firing at them . The woman , unbeknown to Mick , is shot in the back of the head just as they reach their allies . Mick pulls the girl from her wrecked car and puts all his `` sparkiness '' into her just before passing out . Mick awakes in the lair of his new allies . Upon questioning , Mick learns that the girl is alive and that he had somehow healed her from the bullet wound . Mick is on his way to officially meet the young lady when the story abruptly ends .
The Philadelphia Atoms were a soccer team based out of Philadelphia that played in the North American Soccer League ( NASL ) . They played from 1973 to 1976 , at Veterans Stadium ( 1973-75 ) and Franklin Field ( 1976 ) . The Atoms were founded by Philadelphia construction mogul Thomas McCloskey in 1973 at the urging of Kansas City Chiefs and Dallas Tornado owner Lamar Hunt . Playing a largely American line-up , they won the NASL title in their first year of existence by defeating Huntâ s Dallas club 2-0 . After this championship match , Philadelphia goalkeeper and Delaware Valley native Bob Rigby became the first soccer player to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated . The Atoms could not sustain the success of their first season as the club missed the playoffs in each of their remaining three NASL campaigns . Attendance began to flag and , after the 1975 season , the team was sold to a group of Mexican clubs , which included Club Deportivo Guadalajara . Fielding a primarily Mexican side ( almost 20 years before Chivas USA would try a similar approach in Major League Soccer ) , attendances continued to wane and the club folded after the 1976 season . Although Clive Toye reports in his recent book that the franchise was sold to an ownership group from Montreal , he apparently confuses the fate of the next Philadelphia NASL team for that of the Atoms ; the Atoms were , in fact , going to be relocated to San Antonio by their Mexican owners , who planned to replace the San Antonio Thunder franchise ( which itself had just relocated to Honolulu to play as Team Hawaii ) . This plan never came to fruition , and the Philadelphia franchise was placed into receivership by the NASL . The franchise was removed from receivership two years later when the Philadelphia Fury began their three year run in Philadelphia in 1978 .
The in-game description simply states : `` Do n't call it a rat . '' A Mathematician 's Apology is a 1940 essay by British mathematician G. H. Hardy . It concerns the aesthetics of mathematics with some personal content , and gives the layman an insight into the mind of a working mathematician . In the book 's title , Hardy uses the word `` apology '' in the sense of a formal justification or defense ( as in Plato 's Apology of Socrates ) , not in the sense of a plea for forgiveness . Hardy felt the need to justify his life 's work in mathematics at this time mainly for two reasons . Firstly , at age 62 , Hardy felt the approach of old age ( he had survived a heart attack in 1939 ) and the decline of his mathematical creativity and skills . By devoting time to writing the Apology , Hardy was admitting that his own time as a creative mathematician was finished . In his foreword to the 1967 edition of the book , C. P. Snow describes the Apology as `` a passionate lament for creative powers that used to be and that will never come again '' . In Hardy 's words , `` Exposition , criticism , appreciation , is work for second-rate minds . The function of a mathematician is to do something , to prove new theorems , to add to mathematics , and not to talk about what he or other mathematicians have done . '' Secondly , at the start of the Second World War , Hardy , a committed pacifist , wanted to justify his belief that mathematics should be pursued for its own sake rather than for the sake of its applications . He wanted to write a book in which he would explain his mathematical philosophy to the next generation of mathematicians ; that would defend mathematics by elaborating on the merits of pure mathematics solely , without having to resort to the attainments of applied mathematics in order to justify the overall importance of mathematics ; and that would inspire the upcoming generations of pure mathematicians . Hardy was an atheist , and makes his justification not to God but to his fellow man . One of the main themes of the book is the beauty that mathematics possesses , which Hardy compares to painting and poetry . For Hardy , the most beautiful mathematics was that which had no practical applications in the outside world ( pure mathematics ) and , in particular , his own special field of number theory . Hardy contends that if we were to define useful knowledge as knowledge which is likely to contribute to the material comfort of mankind in the near future if not right now , so that mere intellectual satisfaction is irrelevant , then we will have that the great bulk of higher mathematics is useless . He justifies the pursuit of pure mathematics with the argument that its very `` uselessness '' on the whole meant that it could not be misused to cause harm . On the other hand , Hardy denigrates much of the applied mathematics as either being `` trivial '' , `` ugly '' , or `` dull '' , and contrasts it with `` real mathematics '' , which is how he ranks the higher , pure mathematics . Hardy expounds by commenting about a phrase attributed to Carl Friedrich Gauss that `` Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics '' . Some people believe that it is the extreme non-applicability of number theory that led Gauss to the above statement about number theory ; however , Hardy points out that this is certainly not the reason . If an application of number theory were to be found , then certainly no one would try to dethrone the `` queen of mathematics '' because of that . What Gauss meant , according to Hardy , is that the underlying concepts that constitute number theory are deeper and more elegant compared to those of any other branch of mathematics . Another theme is that mathematics is a `` young man 's game '' , so anyone with a talent for mathematics should develop and use that talent while they are young , before their ability to create original mathematics starts to decline in middle age . This view reflects Hardy 's increasing depression at the wane of his own mathematical powers . For Hardy , real mathematics was essentially a creative activity , rather than an explanatory or expository one . Hardy 's opinions were heavily influenced by the academic culture of the universities of Cambridge and Oxford between World War I and World War II . Some of Hardy 's examples seem unfortunate in retrospect . For example , he writes , `` No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity , and it seems unlikely that anyone will do so for many years . '' Since then , the application of relativity was part of the development of nuclear weapons , while number theory figures prominently in public-key cryptography . However , Hardy 's more prominent examples of elegant mathematical discoveries with no use ( proofs of the infinity of primes and the irrationality of the square root of two ) still hold up . The applicability of a mathematical concept is not the reason that Hardy considered applied mathematics somehow inferior to pure mathematics , though ; it is the simplicity and prosiness that belongs to applied mathematics that led him to describe them as he did .

Szczecin Lagoon or Bay of Szczecin , also Oder lagoon , is a lagoon in the Oder estuary , shared by Germany and Poland . It is separated from the Pomeranian Bay of the Baltic Sea by the islands of Usedom and Wolin . The lagoon is subdivided into the Kleines Haff ( `` small lagoon '' ) in the West and the Wielki Zalew ( , `` great lagoon '' ) in the East . An ambiguous historical German name was Frisches Haff , which later exclusively referred to the Vistula Lagoon . From the South , the lagoon is fed by several arms of the Oder river and smaller rivers like Ziese , Peene , Zarow , Uecker , and Ina . In the North , the lagoon is connected to the Baltic Sea 's Bay of Pomerania with the three straits Peenestrom , Å wina and Dziwna , which divide the mainland and the islands of Usedom and Wolin . The lagoon covers an area of 687 kmÂ , its natural depth is in average 3.8 meters , and 8.5 meters at maximum . The depth of shipping channels however can exceed 10.5 meters . Thus , the lagoon holds about 2.58 km3 of water . The annual average water temperature is 11 Â C. 94 % of the water loads discharged into the lagoon are from the Oder river and its confluences , amounting for an average annual 17 km3 or 540 m3 per second . All other confluences contribute a combined annual 1 km3 . Since no reliable data for an inflow from the Baltic Sea exist , the combined inflow is an estimated 18 km3 from a catchment area of 129,000 km2 , residing in the lagoon for an average 55 days before being discharged into the Pomeranian Bay . The nutrients thereby transported into the lagoon have made it hypertrophic to eutrophic . The straits Peenestrom , Å wina and Dziwna are responsible for 17 % , 69 % , and 14 % of the discharge , respectively . The average salinity is between 0.5 and 2 psu , yet at times more salty water penetrates through the Swine locally rising the salinity to 6 psu . In 1880 , the Kaiserfahrt ( `` Emperor 's passage '' ) channel on Usedom was opened , a water route with a depth of 10 meters connecting the lagoon with the Baltic Sea by bypassing the eastern part of the Swine , allowing large ships to enter the lagoon and the seaport of Stettin quicker and safer . The canal , approximately 12 km long and 10 meters deep , was dug by the German Empire between 1874 and 1880 , during the reign of the first Kaiser Wilhelm ( 1797 â `` 1888 ) after whom it was named . Also , the work resulted in a new island named Kaseburg ( KarsibÃ r ) being cut off from Usedom . After 1945 , the areas east of Oder Neisse line became part of Poland , including the former German seaport cities of Stettin ( Szczecin ) and SwinemÃ 1\/4 nde ( Å winoujÅ cie ) on the western bank of the river Oder was granted to Poland which renamed the canal after the Piast dynasty . The German-Polish border also divides the bight called Neuwarper See near Rieth . The lagoon has served as an important fishing grounds for centuries , as a major transportation pathway since the 18th century , and as a tourist destination since the 20th century . Today the lagoon offers a great selection of passenger ship tours , a wide range of water sports and some notable beaches . Tourists can discover winegrowing , the narrow-gauge railway , museums , castles , many hiking and cycling routes and a small village reviving the life of the former Slavic settlements . The lagoon suffers from heavy pollution , mainly from the Oder river , resulting in eutrophication . High concentrations of aluminium and iron sediments have been found in the river causing rapid algae growth inside the lagoon . However , long-term nutrient concentrations show a high inter-annual variability and have declined during recent years .
Paolo Barison ( 23 June 1936 in Vittorio Veneto â `` 17 April 1979 in Andora ) was an Italian association football player . During his club career he played for S.S.C. Venezia , Genoa C.F.C. , A.C. Milan , U.C. Sampdoria , A.S. Roma , and S.S.C. Napoli . He earned 9 caps and scored 6 goals for the Italy national football team , and played in the 1966 FIFA World Cup .
Guy Rupert Berryman ( 12 April 1978 , in Kirkcaldy , Scotland ) is a Scottish musician best known as the bassist for the groups Coldplay and Apparatjik . Berryman is left-handed but chooses to play the bass the orthodox way . Berryman started an engineering degree at University College London . Soon after , he dropped out of his engineering course and switched to a seven-year architecture program . He dropped out of his architecture degree after one year to focus on playing bass with Coldplay . While his bandmates were still continuing their degrees , Berryman worked as a barman in a local London pub . He is called the `` most handsome one in the band '' with Chris Martin usually commenting on his dark and yet handsome appearance . Jonathan Ross has also stated `` Guy , I think you 're the best looking one in the band ! '' During the Twisted Logic Tour for the promotion of Coldplay 's third album , X&Y , Berryman took candid pictures of the band with disposable cameras and threw them to the audience . Berryman was educated at an independent school in Scotland , The Edinburgh Academy , and Kent , at Kent College Canterbury , before attending University College London . In 2004 , Berryman married Joanna Briston , his childhood sweetheart , in a low key ceremony in the City of Westminster . They have one daughter , Nico , born on 17 September 2006 . Briston used to run a clothing shop called Jezebell in London , which has closed due to debt with running the business . The opening of the store was attended by bandmates Jonny Buckland and Will Champion , and their partners . In March 2007 , Coldplay 's spokesman confirmed that Guy and Joanna separated after three years of marriage . They are now divorced , but see each other frequently for the wellbeing of their daughter Nico . Berryman is an avid marathon runner and likes to run in the nearest parks or around the neighborhoods of the hotels whenever the band is touring . He also has an interest in photography , fashion and electronic gadgets . He is a fan of his local football team Raith Rovers F.C. Berryman owns a vintage retro style juke box and collects Motown and Stax 7 '' singles to play on it . He jokes that he knows `` every secondhand vinyl shop in every major U.S. city '' . Berryman once said to have been starstruck by the late James Brown in concert . According to an article released by MSN UK in April 2008 , Berryman has an estimated wealth of Â # 25 million . Mark Berryman , Guy 's brother , is currently living in Scandinavia . Mark has been with the band from day one and has been an integral part of Coldplay 's success . Guy and Mark are well known to have to have been the main promoters of the band during the early years in Canterbury . Mark is married in Scandinavia and the father of twins . Mark has moved on to run an import export business . On June 7 , 2010 , The Sun reported that Berryman and his brother Mark would be forming a company for antiques . In 2004 , Guy ( and Will Champion ) collaborated with Magne Furuholmen of a-ha , Guy 's big musical hero , on his solo album Past Perfect Future Tense playing the song Kryptonite . In 2008 , Berryman participated to the Movie Soundtheme of Umi no Shanghai . He also played the bass guitar in Furuholmen 's A Dot of Black in the Blue of Your Bliss . In the same year he collaborated with Magne Furuholmen , Jonas Bjerre ( of Mew ) and Martin Terefe under the band name of Apparatjik for the theme to the BBC2 series , Amazon . The theme is available along with exclusive tracks from various other artists on the Survival International charity album , Songs for Survival . Apparatjik has recently announced on their Twitter and Facebook pages that a new track called `` Electric Eye '' will be available on the 30th of November , as a free download on their website . Apparatjik made their very first live performance at the eleventh edition of club transmediale , an annual festival in Berlin , due to take place between 28 January and 7 February 2010 . This first ever performance of Apparatjik took place inside a specially constructed cube at the WMF on Monday , February 1 , 2010 . ( 1 ) On the same day , they released of their debut album , titled We Are Here . Berryman was credited with providing photographs for the inner sleeve of the album Foot of the Mountain , released by Norwegian pop band a-ha in 2009 .

relating to an established procedure or set of specific behaviors . Presentation is the practice of showing and explaining the content of a topic to an audience or learner . A presentation program , such as Microsoft PowerPoint , Apple Keynote , OpenOffice.org Impress or Prezi , is often used to generate the presentation content . The development of information technology has made the use of these solutions possible , but overhead transparencies are still used widely . In recent years it has become increasingly common for employers to request job applicants who are successfully shortlisted to deliver one or more presentations at their interview . The purpose of the presentation in this setting may be to either demonstrate candidates ' skills and abilities in presenting , or to highlight their knowledge of a given subject likely to relate closely to the job role for which they have applied . It is common for the applicant to be notified of the request for them to deliver a presentation along with their invitation to attend the interview . Usually applicants are only given a title for their presentation and a time limit which the presentation should not exceed . Be sure to hone up on current presentation etiquette before preparing slide presentations .
Howard G. `` Ward '' Cunningham ( born May 26 , 1949 ) is an American computer programmer who developed the first wiki . A pioneer in both design patterns and Extreme Programming , he started programming the software WikiWikiWeb in 1994 and installed it on the website of his software consultancy , Cunningham & Cunningham ( commonly known by its domain name , c2 . He currently lives in Beaverton , Oregon and is the chief technology officer for AboutUs . He has co-authored a book about wikis , titled The Wiki Way , and also invented Framework for Integrated Tests . He was a keynote speaker at the first three instances of the WikiSym conference series on wiki research and practice . Cunningham received his Bachelor 's degree in interdisciplinary engineering ( electrical engineering and computer science ) and his master 's degree in computer science from Purdue University . He is a founder of Cunningham & Cunningham , Inc. . He has also served as Director of R&D at Wyatt Software and as Principal Engineer in the Tektronix Computer Research Laboratory . He is founder of the Hillside Group and has served as program chair of the Pattern Languages of Programming conference which it sponsors . Cunningham was part of the Smalltalk community . From December 2003 until October 2005 , he worked for Microsoft Corporation in the `` patterns & practices '' group . From October 2005 to May 2007 , he held the position of Director of Committer Community Development at the Eclipse Foundation . In May 2007 , he joined AboutUs as its chief technology officer . Cunningham is well-known for a few widely disseminated ideas which he originated and developed . The most famous among these are the wiki ( named after WikiWikiWeb ) and many ideas in the field of software patterns . He owns the company Cunningham & Cunningham Inc. , a small consultancy that has specialized in object-oriented programming . In a 2006 interview with internetnews.com Cunningham described his thinking about patenting the Wiki concept when he first created it . He has a current interest in tracking the number and location of wiki page edits as a sociological experiment and may even consider the degradation of a wiki page as part of its process to stability . â There are those who give like Chalmers , and those who take , like Weir & Barlow . You can tell by reading what they write . â Cunningham is also well known for his contributions to the developing practice of object-oriented programming , in particular the use of pattern languages and ( with Kent Beck ) CRC ( Class-Responsibility Collaboration ) cards . He is also a significant contributor to the Extreme Programming software development methodology . A great deal of this work was collaboratively carried out in the first wiki site itself .
May is the fifth month of the year in the Gregorian Calendar and one of seven Gregorian months with the length of 31 days . May is a month of autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and spring in the Northern Hemisphere . Therefore May in the Southern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent of November in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa . The month May has been named for the Greek goddess Maia , who was identified with the Roman era goddess of fertility , Bona Dea , whose festival was held in May . Conversely , the Roman poet Ovid provides a second etymology , in which he says that the month of May is named for the maiores , Latin for `` elders , '' and that the following month ( June ) is named for the iuniores , or `` young people '' ( Fasti VI .88 ) . In both common Western calendrical systems , no other month begins on the same day of the week as May . This month and June are the only two months that have this trait , though the first day of August in a common year and the first day of October in a leap year are also unique . No other month ends on the same day of the week as May . ( See : Months in various calendars ) Third Saturday is the Preakness , second jewel in the triple crown of horse racing . Last Monday
See Konica Cup ( football ) . Current J. League identity and\/or standing in the Japanese football league system follows each name . Many of these clubs would only be promoted to the top flight after the J. League was created . Pierre Michael Littbarski ( born 16 April 1960 in Berlin ) is a German football manager and former player . He was mainly a winger or attacking midfielder and is best known for his brilliant dribbling abilities . He was a FIFA World Cup winner with West Germany in 1990 . He was also runnerâ `` up twice in 1982 and 1986 with West Germany . He was caretaker manager of VfL Wolfsburg after taking over from Steve McClaren from 7 February 2011 to 17 March 2011 . Littbarski spent most of his playing career at 1 . FC KÃ ln , winning the German Cup once , in 1983 , and was three times runner up in the Bundesliga ( 1982 , 1989 and 1990 ) . He has also played for Racing Club de Paris in Ligue 1 as well as for JEF United and Brummel Sendai in Japan . In his career , he was initially used as a deep-lying striker before being utilised as an attacking midfielder . `` Litti '' , as he was nicknamed by German fans , was widely known for his excellent dribbling abilities and humorous attitude , being one of the fan favorites in German Bundesliga during this decade . In 1985 his goal versus Werder Bremen was elected `` Goal of the Year '' . Littbarski earned his first cap for West Germany on October 14 , 1981 in the 1982 World Cup qualification against Austria . West Germany manager Jupp Derwall started him in a three-man front line alongside Klaus Fischer and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge . Littbarski 's international career got off to a promising start , as he scored both the opening and the second goals in that game . His third international goal came at the 1982 World Cup , in the second round match against Spain , a 2 â `` 1 victory . Against France in the semi-final , Littbarski scored the opening goal and , later , on a penalty kick in the deciding post-overtime shoot-out . The now legendary match ended in a 3 â `` 3 draw , with the Germans eventually winning 5 â `` 4 on penalties . Littbarski was also involved in the dramatic equalizer , crossing to Horst Hrubesch , who headed to Fischer , who in turn scored with an overhead bicycle kick . West Germany lost 3 â `` 1 to Italy in the final . Littbarski played the whole match , receiving a yellow card in the 88th minute . At the UEFA Euro 1984 , West Germany , with Littbarski , were eliminated in the group stage after a string of poor performances . The 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico , while successful for West Germany , proved less so for Littbarski personally . He was benched by manager Franz Beckenbauer , and had to watch the semiâ `` finals and the finals from the bench . Eventually , West Germany finished again as runnersâ `` up , this time losing 3 â `` 2 to Argentina . The German players had high hopes for the UEFA Euro 1988 on their home soil . However , the hosts lost 2 â `` 1 to the Netherlands in the semiâ `` finals . Littbarski did not score any goals in the tournament . In 1990 , Littbarski enjoyed a successful final appearance at the FIFA World Cup , as West Germany won their third title , defeating Argentina 1 â `` 0 in the final in Rome . Littbarski scored his only goal in the group stage against Colombia but started three of the four games at the knockout stage , including the final . In 1999 he started his coaching career with Yokohama FC of Japan Football League and he led the club to the promotion to J. League Division 2 . He has also been the manager of Yokohama FC ( twice ) , as well as assistant manager of Bayer 04 Leverkusen and manager of MSV Duisburg . He was manager of Australian A-League side Sydney FC between 2005 and 2006 , and led them to the FIFA Club World Championship in 2005 , and a win in the inaugural A-League Championship . He was famous amongst Sydney FC supporters and the media for his stylish brown suits . Sydney under Littbarski were criticised for boring football , but the results could seldom be argued with and Sydney FC went on to claim the inaugural A-League Championship under his reign . Littbarski and Sydney FC severed ties on Wednesday , 5 May 2006 , with Littbarski announcing he would not re-sign for the club following disputes over a cut-price contract offer . In December 2006 , Littbarski was appointed the manager of Avispa Fukuoka , a J-League side that was newly demoted to the second division after the 2006 season . In July 2008 , he left the club and was replaced by Yoshiyuki Shinoda . On 26 July 2008 it was announced that he became the new manager of Iranian side Saipa F.C.

LuisÃ # o 's younger siblings , Alex Silva and Andrei Silva , are also footballers , and defenders . Cristiano Marques Gomes ( born 3 June 1977 in Guarulhos , SÃ # o Paulo ) or simply Cris , is a Brazilian footballer . He currently plays for Olympique Lyonnais as a center back and has also represented his country . Also nicknamed `` the policeman '' by way of reference to his authoritarian nature on the pitch and his 4 months experience in a police department in Guarulhos . He has also won the Ligue 1 with Olympique Lyonnais in 2005 to 2008 , the Brazilian Championship in 1998 with Corinthians and in 2003 with Cruzeiro . He also won the Copa do Brasil in 1995 with Corinthians and 2000 with Cruzeiro EC and the Copa America in 2004 with Brazil . Cris spent a three year spell in SÃ # o Paulo playing for Corinthians ( 1995 -- 98 ) before joining Cruzeiro . There he won his first cap for the national team , playing on 4 April 1999 against the USA in Brasilia ( a match won 7 -- 0 by Brazil ) . In 2000 , the Brazilian magazine Placar named Cris as the leading player in his position during the Brazilian Championship , awarding him the Silver Ball title . In 2002 , he secured a transfer to Europe , moving to Bayer Leverkusen in Germany . However , this move did not prove successful as he struggled to adapt to his new surroundings both on and off the field . The following year saw him return to his native country , rejoining Cruzeiro as part of their Brazilian Championship winning team of that year . In August 2004 , he left Brazil once more , this time moving to Olympique Lyonnais for a transfer fee close to â 3.5 million . Having been involved in a brawl during a match in June earlier that year Cris ran the risk of a six month suspension that the Brazilian Football Federation eventually decided not to extend to matches outside of Brazil . This affair , along with the physical duel he enjoyed with Thierry Henry during the France-Brazil international at the Stade de France on 20 May 2004 ( a match that finished goalless ) , earned Cris the reputation of a rough , rugged defender . After an unconvincing first spell in Europe Cris quickly imposed himself at the heart of Olympique Lyonnais ' defense , proving himself an international class defender . His first season in Ligue 1 saw the club crowned league champions and Cris was selected in the Ligue 1 Players ' team of the year . His second season was one of consolidation : Cris again had an excellent season with Lyon leaving no doubt as to his overall class . He was crowned '' Ã toile d'or '' '' ( Gold Star ) by the magazine France Football . The newspaper L'Equipe considered him the best defender of the 2005 -- 06 season and he was once more voted into the Ligue 1 team of the year by his fellow professionals . This excellent season earned him an upwardly revised salary as well as a one year extension to his contract , tying him to the French club until 2010 . Cris recently extended his contract an additional year keeping him at Lyon until 2011 . Newly appointed OL manager Alain Perrin appointed Cris as the new captain starting from the 2007 -- 08 Ligue 1 season . On 11 August 2007 , Cris was injured in a game between Lyon and Toulouse , tearing ligaments in his right knee during a collision with Johan Elmander . Cris made his return to the squad on 1 March 2008 in a 1 -- 0 win over Lille . The match was held at the Stade de France . He has 16 caps with the Brazilian national team , the first one obtained in July 2001 . Cris was part of the Brazilian squad that capture their 7th Copa AmÃ rica title back in 2004 . He was also rewarded for his magnificent club form on 15 May 2006 by Carlos Alberto Parreira who selected him in the national squad for their 2006 World Cup Campaign in Germany .

Surrender is when soldiers , nations or other combatants stop fighting and eventually become prisoners of war , either as individuals or when ordered to by their officers . A white flag is a common symbol of surrender , as is the gesture of raising one 's hands empty and open above one 's head . When the parties agree to terms the surrender may be conditional , i.e. if the surrendering party promises to submit only after the victor makes certain promises . Otherwise it is a surrender at discretion ( unconditional surrender ) ; the victor makes no promises of treatment other than those provided by the laws and customs of war â '' most of which are laid out in the Hague Conventions ( 1907 ) and the Geneva Conventions . Normally a belligerent will only agree to surrender unconditionally if completely incapable of continuing hostilities . The Third Geneva Convention states that prisoners of war should not be mistreated or abused . United States Army policy requires that surrendered persons should be secured and safeguarded while being evacuated from the battlefield . Entire nations can also surrender in an attempt to end a war or military conflict . This is done through the signing of an armistice , an unconditional capitulation or peace treaty .

Haute-Corse is a French department . It constitutes the northern part of the island of Corsica . The department was formed on September 15 , 1975 , when the department of Corse was divided into Haute-Corse and Corse-du-Sud . The department corresponds exactly to the former department of Golo which existed between 1793 and 1811 . The department is surrounded on three sides by the Mediterranean Sea and on the south by the department of Corse-du-Sud . The inhabitants of the entire island of Corsica are called Corsicans . The Corsicans are a fiercely independent people . However , a July 6 , 2003 referendum on increased autonomy was voted down by a very thin majority : 50.98 percent against to 49.02 percent for . This was a major setback for French Minister of the Interior Nicolas Sarkozy , who had hoped to use Corsica as the first step in his decentralization policies . The President of the General Council is Paul Giacobbi , who has held the office since 1998 .
Deniz Baykal ( born 20 July 1938 in Antalya , Turkey ) is a Turkish politician . He was a long-time leader of the Republican People 's Party ( CHP ) . Baykal was born to HÃ 1\/4 seyin Hilmi and Feride in Antalya and of Circassian descent . He was educated at the University of Ankara 's Faculty of Law . He later studied at the University of California , Berkeley and Columbia University , New York in the U.S. as a research fellow , and finished his PhD by 1963 in Ankara . He became an Associate Professor in the University of Ankara 's Faculty of Science , where he lectured until he became a professional politician . He quit his career as an academic in 1973 , when he was elected as a member of the Turkish parliament from the Republican People 's Party . He served as the Minister of Finance , Energy and Foreign Affairs in various times throughout his career , as well as Deputy Prime Minister . He became the Republican People 's Party 's General Secretary in 1988 , and in 1992 he was elected as the leader of the party , a post he held until May 2010 . Today , his social democratic and secular Republican People 's Party is the second biggest of the country and is the major opposition party in the parliament . Baykal remains a staunch supporter of a strong response to terrorism . He resigned as leader of the Republican People 's Party on May 10 , 2010 . Criticism of his private life after an alleged video-tape showing him in the same bedroom with his former secretary , and a member of parliament Nesrin Baytok , was leaked to the media played a major role in his resignation . The ` Baykal Era ' within the People 's Republican Party also ended in support when the Party Leader 's cabinet was reformed in a party congress which took place in December 2010 . All those in opposition to the new leadership were swiftly removed , and a new administration , mostly consisting of brand-new names some were not even former members of the party , were placed in important positions . This ` New ' , and controversial , CHP will be tested in the upcoming 2011 General Elections , where Deniz Baykal will be running for a seat in the parliament again from his hometown , Antalya .

See William ( name ) for more information on the history of the name William . People known as Bill include : The Low Countries are the historical lands around the low-lying delta of the Rhine , Scheldt , and Meuse rivers , including the modern countries of Belgium , the Netherlands , Luxembourg and parts of northern France and western Germany . The term is more appropriate to the era of the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern Europe when strong centrally governed nations were slowly forming and territorial governance was in the hands of a noble or of a noble house . Historically the region has its origins in Middle Francia , more precisely its northern part which became the Duchy of Lower Lotharingia . After the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia the Low Countries were brought under the rule of various stronger neighbors . Their possessions can be renamed into the Burgundian Netherlands and their succeeding Habsburg Netherlands , also called the United Seventeen Provinces ( up to 1581 ) , and later for the Southern parts as the Spanish Netherlands and Austrian Netherlands , whereas the northern parts formed the autonomous Dutch Republic . At times they reached a form of unity as the United Seventeen Provinces in the 16th Century , and later the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in the 19th Century . The term is not particularly current in modern contexts because the region does not exactly correspond to the sovereign states of the Netherlands , Belgium and Luxembourg , for which an alternative term , Benelux , was employed after the Second World War , but only to describe them as a trading union . Before early modern nation building , the Low Countries referred to a wide area of northern Europe as a low-lying triangular river delta for the rivers Rhine , the Meuse ( river ) , the Scheldt , and the Ems ( river ) . This area roughly stretches from French Gravelines and Dunkirk at its southwestern point , to the area of Dutch Delfzijl and German Eastern Frisia at its northeastern point , and to Luxembourg and French Thionville in the southeast . The Low Countries were the scene of the early northern towns , newbuilt rather than developed from ancient centres , that mark the reawakening of Europe in the 12th century . In that period , they became one of the most densely populated regions of Europe , together with northern Italy . A collection of several regions rather than one homogeneous region , all the low countries still shared a great number of similarities . The low countries were part of the Roman provinces of Belgica , Germania Inferior and Germania Superior . They were inhabited by Belgic tribes , before these were replaced by Germanic tribes in the 4th and 5th century . They were governed by the ruling Merovingian dynasty . By the end of the 8th century , the Low Countries formed a part of Francia and the Merovingians were replaced by the Carolingian dynasty . In 800 the Pope crowned and appointed Charlemagne Emperor of the re-established Roman Empire . After the death of Charlemagne , Francia was divided in three parts among his three grandsons . The Low Countries became part of Middle Francia , which was ruled by Lothair I. After the death of Lothair , the Low Countries were coveted by the rulers of both West Francia and East Francia . Each tried to swallow the region and to merge it with their spheres of influence . Thus , the Low Countries consisted of fiefs whose sovereignty resided with either the Kingdom of France or the Holy Roman Empire . The further history of the Low Countries can be seen as a continual struggle between these two powers . Gradually , separate fiefs came to be ruled by a single family through royal intermarriage . This process culminated in the rule of the House of Valois , who were the rulers of the Duchy of Burgundy In 1477 the Burgundian holdings in the area , the Burgundian Netherlands passed through an heiress -- Mary of Burgundy -- to the Habsburgs . In the following century the `` Low Countries '' corresponded roughly to the Seventeen Provinces covered by the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549 of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V , which freed the provinces from their archaic feudal obligations . After the northern Seven United Provinces of the seventeen declared their independence from Habsburg Spain , the provinces of the Southern Netherlands were recaptured ( 1581 ) and are sometimes called the Spanish Netherlands . In 1713 , under the Treaty of Utrecht following the War of the Spanish Succession , what was left of the Spanish Netherlands was ceded to Austria and thus became known as the Austrian Netherlands . The United Kingdom of the Netherlands ( 1815-1830 ) temporarily united the Low Countries again . In English , the plural form Netherlands is used for the present-day country , but in Dutch that plural has been dropped ; one can thus distinguish between the older , larger Netherlands and the current country .
Mauricio AndrÃ s Pellegrino ( born October 5 , 1971 in Leones , CÃ rdoba ) is a former Argentine footballer , who played as a central defender , and who also spent time as a coach . Pellegrino played for Club AtlÃ tico VÃ lez Sarsfield during a large portion of the 90 's , as the Buenos Aires-based lived its golden era , winning four league titles and the 1994 Intercontinental and Libertadores Cups . In 1998 -- 99 , he had his first abroad experience , joining Louis van Gaal 's FC Barcelona ; he made his Spanish first division debut on September 12 , in a 1 -- 0 win against CF Extremadura , and would be fairly used during the campaign , which ended with league conquest . Pellegrino had his best years with another Spanish side , Valencia CF , partnering countryman Roberto Ayala in the heart of the back-four , while helping the Che to two league titles during his tenure , with the addition of the 2003 -- 04 UEFA Cup . His main dark spot occurred during the 2000 -- 01 UEFA Champions League final , as he missed the decisive penalty shootout attempt against FC Bayern Munich ( 1 -- 1 after 120 minutes ) - he also played in the previous season 's decisive match , which also ended in defeat , against Real Madrid ( 0 -- 3 ) . Overall though , in his six years at Valencia , he was a very important first-team member , and amassed nearly 200 official appearances for the club . In January 2005 , after having been frozen out by Claudio Ranieri , Pellegrino joined former Valencia boss Rafael BenÃ tez at Liverpool on a free transfer , signing a six-month contract . This move made him the first Argentine player in the history of the club . He played 12 times for the Reds in the Premier League - 13 overall - but his performances were not enough to secure a longer contract , and he was released by the club at the end of the season . After being released , he returned to Spain , having an unassuming stint with Deportivo AlavÃ s ( 13 matches , first division relegation ) . After retiring in June 2006 , Pellegrino stayed connected with Valencia , coaching its Cadete-B ( which is their youth team ) ; after a short stint there he decided to return to Liverpool , who still had BenÃ tez in charge , on June 30 , 2008 , as first-team coach , a position he remained in until the summer of 2010 , as the pair moved to F.C. Internazionale Milano . In December 2010 , as BenÃ tez was fired from his post , Pellegrino was also dismissed . Pellegrino gained three caps for Argentina , all during 1997 . He was picked for the squad at that year 's Copa AmÃ rica .

The Principality of Khachen , also known as Khamsa ( meaning five in Arabic ) , was a medieval Armenian principality in the territory of historical Artsakh ( present-day Nagorno-Karabakh ) . The marches of Artsakh and Utik were attached to the Kingdom of Armenia in Antiquity but in the early medieval period were often under Georgian and Albanian control under Sassanid or Arab suzerainty . From the 12th century the Armenian Khachen principality dominated the region . The Byzantine emperor Constantine VII addressed his letters to the prince of Khachen with the inscription `` To Prince of Khachen , Armenia . '' According to AbÅ `` Dulaf , an Arab traveller of the time , Khachen was an Armenian principality immediately south of Barda ` a . The Armenian princely family of Hasan Jalalyan began ruling much of Khachen and Artsakh in 1214 . In 1216 , the Jalalyans founded the Gandzasar monastery which became the seat of a local Catholicos forced to Khachen from Partav ( Barda ) by the steady Islamization of the city . The Khamsa ( The Five ) principalities maintained Armenian autonomy in the region throughout the Persian-Ottoman Wars . In 1603 the Persians established a protectorate over the Khamsa and sponsored the establishment of a local khanate in 1750 . The name Khamsa , which was used by Arabs for the state , refers to the five Armenian Melikdoms who ruled the state .
Heinrich Hermann Robert Koch ( ; 11 December 1843 â `` 27 May 1910 ) was a Prussian physician . He became famous for isolating Bacillus anthracis ( 1877 ) , the Tuberculosis bacillus ( 1882 ) and the Vibrio cholerae ( 1883 ) and for his development of Koch 's postulates . He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his tuberculosis findings in 1905 . He is considered one of the founders of microbiology , inspiring such major figures as Paul Ehrlich and Gerhard Domagk . Heinrich Hermann Robert Koch was born in Clausthal , Prussia one of the German states as the son of a mining official . He studied medicine under Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle at the University of GÃ ttingen and graduated in 1866 . He then served in the Franco-Prussian War and later became district medical officer , Wollstein ( Wolsztyn ) , Prussian Poland . Working with very limited resources , he became one of the founders of bacteriology , the other major figure being Louis Pasteur . After Casimir Davaine showed the direct transmission of the anthrax bacillus between cows , Koch studied anthrax more closely . He invented methods to purify the bacillus from blood samples and grow pure cultures . He found that , while it could not survive outside a host for long , anthrax built persisting endospores that could last a long time . These endospores , embedded in soil , were the cause of unexplained `` spontaneous '' outbreaks of anthrax . Koch published his findings in 1876 , and was rewarded with a job at the Imperial Health Office in Berlin in 1880 . In 1881 , he urged the sterilization of surgical instruments using heat . In Berlin , he improved the methods he used in Wollstein , including staining and purification techniques , and bacterial growth media , including agar plates ( thanks to the advice of Angelina and Walther Hesse ) and the Petri dish , named after its inventor , his assistant Julius Richard Petri . These devices are still used today . With these techniques , he was able to discover the bacterium causing tuberculosis ( Mycobacterium tuberculosis ) in 1882 ( he announced the discovery on 24 March ) . Tuberculosis was the cause of one in seven deaths in the mid-19th century . In 1883 , Koch worked with a French research team in Alexandria , Egypt , studying cholera . Koch identified the vibrio bacterium that caused cholera , though he never managed to prove it in experiments . The bacterium had been previously isolated by Italian anatomist Filippo Pacini in 1854 , but his work had been ignored due to the predominance of the miasma theory of disease . Koch was unaware of Pacini 's work and made an independent discovery , and his greater preeminence allowed the discovery to be widely spread for the benefit of others . In 1965 , however , the bacterium was formally renamed Vibrio cholera Pacini 1854 . In 1885 , he became professor of hygiene at the University of Berlin , then in 1891 he was made Honorary Professor of the medical faculty and Director of the new Prussian Institute for Infectious Diseases ( eventually renamed as the Robert Koch Institute ) , a position from which he resigned in 1904 . He started traveling around the world , studying diseases in South Africa , India , and Java . He visited what is now called the Indian Veterinary Research Institute ( IVRI ) , Mukteshwar on request of the then Government of India to investigate on cattle plague . The microscope used by him during that period was kept in the museum maintained by IVRI . Koch 's pupils found the organisms responsible for diphtheria , typhoid , pneumonia , gonorrhoea , cerebrospinal meningitis , leprosy , bubonic plague , tetanus , and syphilis , among others , by using his methods . Robert Koch died on 27 May 1910 from a heart-attack in Baden-Baden , aged 66 . The crater Koch on the Moon is named after him . The Robert Koch Prize and Medal were created to honor Microbiologists who make groundbreaking discoveries or who contribute to global health in a unique way . The now-defunct Robert Koch Hospital at Koch , Missouri ( south of St. Louis , Missouri ) , was also named in his honor . A hagiographic account of Koch 's career can be found in the 1939 Nazi propaganda film Robert Koch , der BekÃ mpfer des Todes ( The fighter against death ) , directed by Hans Steinhoff and starring Emil Jannings as Koch . Because the construction efforts were jeopardized by malaria outbreaks on Veliki Brijun Island which occurred during summer months and even Kupelwieser himself fell ill with the disease . , so at the turn of the century , the Austrian steel industrialist Paul Kupelweiser had invited the famous physician Robert Koch , who at the time studied different forms of malaria and quinine-based treatments . Koch accepted the invitation and spent two years , from 1900 to 1902 , on the Brijuni Islands Archipelago . According to Kochâ s instructions , all the ponds and swamps where malaria-carrying mosquitoes hatched were reclaimed and patients were treated with quinine . Malaria was thus eradicated by 1902 and Kupelwieser erected a monument to Koch , which still stands in vicinity of the 15th century Church of St. German on Veliki Brijun Island .

A quiz is a form of game or mind sport in which the players ( as individuals or in teams ) attempt to answer questions correctly . In some countries , a quiz is also a brief assessment used in education and similar fields to measure growth in knowledge , abilities , and\/or skills . Quizzes are usually scored in points and many quizzes are designed to determine a winner from a group of participants - usually the participant with the highest score . The first appearance of the word is from 1784 and means an odd person . This sense survives today in the word `` quizzical '' . It was also used in the term quizzing glass , a common accoutrement of British Regency dandies . It later acquired a meaning of to make fun of , or to mock . How it acquired its current meaning of a test is unknown , but that sense did not appear until 1867 and then it was in the United States . The OED2 has a citation from 1847 where the word appears : `` She com back and quiesed us '' , which could be a clue to its origin . American Heritage says it may be from the English dialect verb quiset , meaning to question . In any case it is probably from the same root as question and inquisitive . There is a well-known myth about the word `` quiz '' , which says that in 1791 a Dublin theater owner named James Daly made a bet that he could introduce a word into the language within twenty-four hours . He then went out and hired a group of street urchins to write the word `` quiz '' , which was a nonsense word , on walls around the city of Dublin . Within a day , the word was common currency and had acquired a meaning ( since no one knew what it meant , everyone thought it was some sort of test ) and Daly had some extra cash in his pocket . However , there is no evidence to support the story , and the term was already in use before the alleged bet in 1791 . Quizzes may be held on a variety of subjects ( general knowledge , ` pot luck ' ) or subject-specific . The format of the quiz can also vary widely . Popularly known competition quizzes include A quiz is usually a form of a student assessment , but often has fewer questions of lesser difficulty and requires less time for completion than a test . This use is typically found in the USA , Canada , and some colleges in India . Additionally , a personality quiz may be a series of multiple-choice questions about the respondent without right or wrong answers . The responses to these questions are tallied according to a key , and the result purports to reveal some quality of the respondent . This kind of `` quiz '' was originally popularized by women 's magazines such as Cosmopolitan . They have since become common on the internet , where the result page typically includes code which can be added to a blog entry to publicize the result . These postings are common on LiveJournal . There are also many online quizzes , many webmasters have quiz sections on their websites and forums , phpBB2 has one MOD ( modification ) which allows users to submit quizzes , this is the Ultimate Quiz MOD . Most of the online quizzes are to be taken lightly . The results do not often reflect the true personality or relationship . They are also rarely psychometrically valid . However , they may occasion reflection on the subject of the quiz and provide a springboard for a person to explore his or her emotions , beliefs , or actions .

The square yard is an imperial\/US customary ( non-metric ) unit of area , formerly used in most of the English-speaking world but now generally replaced by the square metre outside of the U.S. , Canada and the U.K. . It is defined as the area of a square with sides of one yard ( three feet , thirty-six inches , 0.9144 metres ) in length . ( Gaj in Hindi )

Luigi de Agostini ( born April 7 , 1961 ) is an Italian former football defender , who represented the Italian national football team at Euro 1988 and the 1990 FIFA World Cup . De Agostini was born in Udine . His professional career began with his hometown club , Udinese , where he rarely played , forcing him to move to Serie C1 for Trento for a year . He was immediately back in the Serie A next year , however this time for Catanzaro before he moved back to Udinese , this time much more prominent . In 1986 , he was signed on for Hellas Verona , though it was the year after that before he found his greatest success , while signed with Juventus . During his five-year stay with Juventus , he achieved his first international cap , ( a 0-0 draw against Norway on May 28 , 1987 ) won both the Italian Cup and the UEFA Cup , and participated in Euro '88 ( scoring against Denmark ) and the Italia '90 World Cup . Unfortunately , his time with Juventus also included his last game for the Italian national team on September 25 , 1991 , a 1-2 loss to Bulgaria . He scored for Juventus as they beat Fiorentina in the 1990 UEFA Cup Final . After that , Luigi moved to Inter Milan for a year , then transferred to Reggiana to end his career . De Agostini is now the Team Manager at his old club , Udinese . His job entails acting as a middleman between the team 's manager , Giovanni Galeone , and the squad of players .
The LÃ 1\/4 beck law was the constitution of a municipal form of government developed at LÃ 1\/4 beck in Schleswig-Holstein after it was made a free city in 1226 . The law provides for self-government . It replaced the personal rule of tribal monarchs descending from ancient times or the rule of the regional dukes and kings that had been established by Charlemagne . The latter held all of his aristocratic vassals personally responsible for the defense , health and welfare of the tribesmen settled on their estates , including the towns . The LÃ 1\/4 beck Law in theory made the cities to which it applied independent of royalty . LÃ 1\/4 beck set about spreading its form of government to other cities around the Baltic Sea . Eventually about 100 adopted a government based on the law . It still serves as a foundation for German town laws in many of those cities . Later in the 13th century , cities governed by the LÃ 1\/4 beck Law formed into a powerful trade association , the Hanseatic League , which amounted to a confederacy with headquarters at LÃ 1\/4 beck . An official LÃ 1\/4 beck law transcript was never available or used until the revised edition of 1586 was printed by printer Johann Balhorn , but rather LÃ 1\/4 beck was the a leader in German cities giving rights to town citizens and overturning aristocratic privilege . This was the basis for the Dortmund code in Westphalia , the Goslar code in Saxony and the Magdeburg rights in East-Central and East European towns . References to ` German Law ' in the Middle Ages mean laws sprung from the LÃ 1\/4 beck law at root . The LÃ 1\/4 beck law provided that a city should be governed by a Rat ( Council ) , having 20 Ratsherrn ( council members ) . They were not elected by the citizens , but they would appoint a new member on their own from the city 's merchant guilds , considering a key of representation of the guilds in the Rat of the city . The period of office was in principle 2 years , but the Rat could ask a Ratsherr to stay in office , which usually happened , so that the election was for life . The Rat then elected up to four BÃ 1\/4 rgermeister ( burgomaster , mayor ) out of its own row , who shared the power of government . The `` first burgomaster '' , usually the eldest of them , acted as a primus inter pares . These rules were in force up to the middle of the 19th century . The burgomasters stayed in office as long as they could , but there are quite a few examples from the Middle Ages in which burgomasters of Hanseatic League cities were sentenced to death for unsuccessful politics . This model of a city government provided that only the most experienced , influential and personally most successful merchants - and a few lawyers , called Syndics - became member of the Rat . It was also a rule that a father and his son , or brothers , could never be members of the Rat at the same time , so that influential families could not get a larger influence on the city 's politics .

Eastern European Summer Time ( EEST ) is one of the names of UTC +3 time zone , 3 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time . It is used as a summer daylight saving time in some European , North African , and Middle Eastern countries . During the winter , the Eastern European Time ( UTC +2 ) is used . Since 1996 European Summer Time has been observed from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October ; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union . In one year 1991 EEST was used also in Moscow and Samara time zones of Russia .

Samuel Dexter ( May 14 , 1761 - May 4 , 1816 ) was an early American statesman who served both in Congress and in the Presidential Cabinet . Born in Boston , Massachusetts , to the Rev. Samuel Dexter , the 4th minister of Dedham , he graduated from Harvard University in 1781 and then studied law at Worcester under Levi Lincoln , Sr. , the future Attorney General of the United States . After he passed the bar in 1784 , he began practicing in Lunenburg , Massachusetts . He was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives and served 1788 to 1790 . He was elected to the 3rd Congress by way of the United States House of Representatives and then elected as Federalist to the United States Senate . In December 1799 , he memorably wrote the memorial eulogy to George Washington upon the first president 's death . His house in Dedham stands to today . He served for less than a year as he was appointed United States Secretary of War by President John Adams in 1800 . During his time at this station he urged congressional action to permit appointment and compensation of field officers for general staff duty . Upon Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott , Jr. 's resignation in December 1800 , Adams appointed Dexter as interim Secretary . He then briefly conducted the affairs of the War Office . He administered the oath of office to Chief Justice John Marshall , and later declined the ambassadorship to Spain . He returned to Boston in 1805 and resumed the practice of law . He left the Federalist party to espouse Republican views on the War of 1812 , and he was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Massachusetts in 1814 and 1815 . He was an ardent supporter of the temperance movement and presided over its first formal organization in Massachusetts . He died on May 4 , 1816 shortly before his 55th birthday and is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge , Massachusetts . Simon Newton Dexter was his nephew . Samuel W. Dexter , founder of Dexter , Michigan , was his son . The USRC Dexter ( 1830 ) was named in his honor .

The creation was put on a stick in 1934 . In 1921 Nelson entered into an agreement with Russell Stover to market and produce the product . The handwritten agreement is part of a display at the Monona County Historical Museum in Onawa . Onawa was the site of a POW camp for captured German soldiers , sometime between 1944 and 1946 . Historical documents indicate there were never more than 50 POWs in camp . A larger camp existed near the central Iowa town of Algona , and housed as many as 5,400 German POWs .
`` All My Loving '' is a song by The Beatles , written by Paul McCartney ( credited to Lennon\/McCartney ) , from the 1963 album With The Beatles . Though it was not released as a single in the United Kingdom or the United States , it drew considerable radio airplay , prompting EMI to issue it as the title track of an EP . The song was released as a single in Canada , where it became a number one hit . The Canadian single was imported into the US in enough quantities to peak at number 45 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April 1964 . According to journalist Bill Harry , McCartney wrote the lyrics while shaving , though McCartney told biographer Barry Miles that he wrote them while on a tour bus . He also said , `` It was the first song I 'd ever written the words first . I never wrote words first , it was always some kind of accompaniment . I 've hardly ever done it since either . '' The lyrics follow the `` letter song '' model as used on `` P.S. I Love You '' , the B-side of their first single . After arriving at the location of the gig , he wrote the music on a piano backstage . McCartney originally envisioned it as a country & western song , and George Harrison added a Nashville-style guitar solo . John Lennon 's rhythm guitar track uses quickly strummed triplets similar to `` Da Doo Ron Ron '' by The Crystals , a song that was popular at the time . The Beatles recorded the song on 30 July 1963 in eleven takes with three overdubs . The master take was take fourteen overdubbed on take eleven . It was remixed on 21 August ( mono ) and 29 October ( stereo ) . A slightly longer stereo edition of the song , featuring a hi-hat percussion introduction not found on the common stereo or mono mixes was released in Germany and the Netherlands in 1965 on a compilation album entitled Beatles ' Greatest . `` All My Loving '' was originally released in the UK on 22 November 1963 on With the Beatles . The first US release was on Meet the Beatles ! , released 20 January 1964 . The song was the title track of the All My Loving EP released in the UK on 7 February 1964 . `` All My Loving '' was the Beatles 's opening number on their debut performance on The Ed Sullivan Show on 9 February 1964 ; the recording was included on Anthology 1 . The group also performed `` All My Loving '' three times for BBC radio , once in 1963 and twice in 1964 . The final version , which was recorded on 28 February 1964 , was included on Live at the BBC . The song was used twice in films by the group - it plays in the background at the end of the nightclub scene in A Hard Day 's Night ( though without the drum opening and the coda ) , while an instrumental version appears in the movie Magical Mystery Tour . According to Alan Weiss , a TV producer who happened to be there , `` All My Loving '' was playing on the sound system at Roosevelt Hospital emergency room when Lennon was pronounced dead after being shot on 8 December 1980 . `` All My Loving '' has been praised by multiple critics . Ian MacDonald said , `` The innocence of early Sixties British pop is perfectly distilled in the eloquent simplicity of this number '' and described the song as helping McCartney be seen as more of an equal to Lennon . Richie Unterberger of Allmusic said it `` was arguably the best LP-only track The Beatles did before 1964 '' and that if it was released as a single in America it would have been a huge hit . Personnel per Ian MacDonald In live performances , George Harrison joined Paul McCartney on lead vocal for the verse following the guitar solo in order to better reproduce the double tracked McCartney vocal heard in the LP version .
Jordan had particularly stressed that this series would be significantly shorter than The Wheel of Time saga ( about 6 books long and essentially two trilogies ) . Brian Thomas Burke ( born in Perth , 25 February 1947 ) was Labor premier of Western Australia from 25 February 1983 until his resignation on 25 February 1988 . Burke was imprisoned for seven months in 1994 , after being convicted of `` false pretence '' regarding travel expenses . In following decades , Burke continued to maintain his Labor party contacts and parliamentary influence , using them to further his career as a pro-business lobbyist . Burke worked both sides of politics in partnership with disgraced former ministerial colleague Julian Grill and assisted by former senator , Noel Crichton-Browne , to influence Liberal parliamentarians . The son of federal Labor parliamentarian Tom Burke , Brian Burke started his career as a journalist , initially at the West Australian newspaper and later in radio and television . He entered politics in 1973 , winning the Legislative Assembly seat of Balcatta at a by-election . His elder brother Terry held the seat of Perth from 1968-1987 . In 1981 , Brian Burke defeated Ron Davies to become opposition leader . At the February 1983 state election , he became the state 's 23rd premier ( and its third youngest after John Scaddan and Newton Moore ) , ending almost nine years of conservative coalition government which had commenced under Sir Charles Court , and was completed by Ray O'Connor ( 1982 â `` 1983 ) . On 25 February 1983 , Burke 's 36th birthday , the governor commissioned the Burke ministry . The Burke government abolished capital punishment in Western Australia in 1984 . His premiership was characterised by very close associations with businessmen such as Laurie Connell and Alan Bond and arranging joint government and business deals . As a result of the 1987 stock market crash , major corporate collapses including that of Connell 's merchant bank Rothwells unwound some of those deals which , in turn , caused major losses to the state . The corporate deals and the attempted government-sponsored rescue of Rothwells under subsequent premier Peter Dowding were widely styled in media and civil society as `` WA Inc '' . Burke resigned as premier and as member for Balga on 25 February 1988 , on the fifth anniversary of his becoming premier and his own 41st birthday . A packed public gallery attended his resignation speech and both he and his deputy Mal Bryce , who resigned on the same day , were given a rare standing ovation in the House . Burke was able to play the part of kingmaker , convincing party colleagues to support the Dowding-Parker ticket for the leadership . Burke then accepted an appointment as Australia 's ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See . As a result of the allegations , the WA Inc royal commission was established in 1991 , and led to Burke being charged with various offences for which he was sentenced to two years ' imprisonment . He served seven months in jail in 1994 for travel expense rorts before being released on parole . In March 1997 he was sentenced to three years ' jail for stealing $ 122,585 in campaign donations . He served six months before the convictions were quashed on appeal . He was stripped of his honor as a Companion of the Order of Australia . Burke has since been active as a consultant and lobbyist for Western Australian business interests . His continued involvement in state Labor branch politics has been a subject of controversy since before Labor returned to power in 2001 . Former premier Geoff Gallop banned cabinet ministers from contact with Burke , but this was lifted by his successor Alan Carpenter when he took office in February 2006 . On 9 November 2006 , Burke resigned from the Labor party after public criticism from Labor premier Alan Carpenter , in part due to evidence provided to the Corruption and Crime Commission ( CCC ) . Norm Marlborough MLA , the Minister for Small Business and the South-West in the Carpenter Ministry , was forced to resign from the Ministry and from the parliament on 10 November 2006 after the Corruption and Crime Commission revealed he had kept a `` secret mobile phone '' to stay in touch with Burke . This triggered a by-election for Marlborough 's seat of Peel , although Labor retained the seat . Burke subsequently stood trial on five charges of telling lies to the CCC inquiry and on 1 April 2010 was found guilty of deliberately giving false testimony .
Salicaceae is a family of flowering plants . Recent genetic studies by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group ( APG ) has greatly expanded the circumscription of the family to contain 57 genera . In the Cronquist system the Salicaceae was treated in its own order Salicales , and contained only three genera ( Salix , Populus and Chosenia ) , but APG includes it in the Malpighiales . The additional genera were previously treated in the Flacourtiaceae , but had a mixed history before that and have been treated in Bembiciaceae , Caseariaceae , Homaliaceae , Poliothyrsidaceae , Prockiaceae , Samydaceae , and Scyphostegiaceae . The Samydaceae ( including Caseariaceae ) appear rather distinct and might be a valid family however . Gerrardina is now considered the sole genus of a separate family , Gerrardinaceae .

Strontium-90 ( 90Sr ) is a radioactive isotope of strontium , with a half life of 28.8 years . Natural strontium is nonradioactive and nontoxic , but 90Sr is a radioactivity hazard . 90Sr undergoes Î â ' decay with decay energy of 0.546 MeV to an electron and the yttrium isotope 90Y , which in turn undergoes Î â ' decay with half life of 64 hours and decay energy 2.28 MeV for beta particles to an electron and 90Zr ( zirconium ) , which is stable . Note that 90Sr\/Y is almost a perfectly pure beta source ; the gamma photon emission from the decay of 90Y is so weak that it can normally be ignored . 90Sr finds extensive use in medicine and industry , as a radioactive source for thickness gauges and for superficial radiotherapy of some cancers . Controlled amounts of 90Sr and 89Sr can be used in treatment of bone cancer . As the radioactive decay of strontium-90 generates significant amount of heat , and is cheaper than the alternative 238Pu , it is used as a heat source in many Russian\/Soviet radioisotope thermoelectric generators , usually in the form of strontium fluoride . It is also used as a radioactive tracer in medicine and agriculture . The results of a study of hundreds of thousands of teeth collected by Dr. Louise Reiss and her colleagues as part of the Baby Tooth Survey showed that children born after 1963 had levels of 90Sr in their deciduous teeth that was 50 times higher than that found in children born before the advent of large-scale atomic testing . The findings helped convince U.S. President John F. Kennedy to sign the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with the United Kingdom and Soviet Union , which ended the above-ground nuclear weapons testing that placed the greatest amounts of nuclear fallout into the atmosphere . A set of 85,000 teeth that had been uncovered in storage in 2001 were given to the Radiation and Public Health Project . By tracking the individuals who had participated in the tooth-collection project , the RHPR published results in a 2010 issue of the International Journal of Health Service that showed that those children who later died of cancer before the age of 50 had levels of strontium 90 in their stored baby teeth that was twice the level of those who were still alive at 50 . 90Sr is a product of nuclear fission . It is present in significant amount in spent nuclear fuel and in radioactive waste from nuclear reactors and in nuclear fallout from nuclear tests . For thermal neutron fission as in today 's nuclear power plants , the fission product yield from U-235 is 5.8 % , from U-233 6.8 % , but from Pu-239 only 2.1 % . Together with caesium isotopes 134Cs , 137Cs , and iodine isotope 131I it was among the most important isotopes regarding health impacts after the Chernobyl disaster . Strontium-90 is a `` bone seeker '' that exhibits biochemical behavior similar to calcium , the next lighter Group 2 element . After entering the organism , most often by ingestion with contaminated food or water , about 70-80 % of the dose gets excreted . Virtually all remaining strontium-90 is deposited in bones and bone marrow , with the remaining 1 % remaining in blood and soft tissues . Its presence in bones can cause bone cancer , cancer of nearby tissues , and leukemia . Exposure to 90Sr can be tested by a bioassay , most commonly by urinalysis . Accidental mixing of radioactive sources containing strontium with metal scrap can result in production of radioactive steel . Discarded radioisotope thermoelectric generators are a major source of 90Sr contamination in the area of the former Soviet Union . In the long-running 2000 AD strip Strontium Dog , Strontium 90 is the radioactive isotope which gave Johnny Alpha his mutant powers , which enables him to emit powerful Alpha rays from his eyes allowing him to see through rock , flesh and also into people 's brains allowing him to tell when they are lying . In the 1954 science fiction film Godzilla , a Japanese scientist claims that Strontium 90 is responsible for the resurrection of the pre-historic monster . In the 1963 science fiction series Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea , Strontium 90 is used as pellets injected into uranium 235 reactors to give the Seaview a boost to power in an emergency . It is also responsible for Emily 's head exploding in The Fringe , which can not happen with exposure to any type of radioactive material . Against All Authority have a song titled The Source of Strontium 90 . Strontium-90 is the isotope that was used to make Nuka-Cola Quantum in the Fallout ( video game ) s.
Green Park tube station is a London Underground station located on the north side of Green Park , close to the intersection of Piccadilly and the pedestrian Queen 's Walk . It is in Travelcard Zone 1 . The station is served by the Piccadilly line , between Piccadilly Circus and Hyde Park Corner , the Victoria line , between Victoria and Oxford Circus , and the Jubilee line , between Bond Street and Westminster . The station was opened on 15 December 1906 by the Great Northern , Piccadilly and Brompton Railway ( GNP&BR ) , the precursor of the Piccadilly line . The station was originally named Dover Street due to its location in that street . When the station was rebuilt in 1933 with escalator access to the platforms , a new sub-surface ticket hall was built to the west under the roadway and new station entrances were constructed on the corner of Piccadilly and Stratton Street and on the south side of Piccadilly . The station name was changed at this time . With the rebuilding of the station and similar works at Hyde Park Corner , the little-used Piccadilly line station between the two at Down Street was taken out of use . The Victoria line platforms opened on 7 March 1969 ; interchange between that line and the Piccadilly line was via the ticket hall ( without having to pass through the exit barriers ) . Even today changing between the Jubilee and Victoria lines and the Piccadilly line involves a long walk . The Jubilee line platforms opened on 1 May 1979 , at which time the next station south on the Jubilee Line was its then southern terminus , Charing Cross ; those platforms were closed when the Jubilee line was extended on a new alignment towards Westminster ; at the same time interchange facilities at Green Park were improved . When traveling south from Green Park on the Jubilee Line , Green Park Junction , where the new line diverges from the old , is visible from the train . While passenger services no longer operate to Charing Cross on the Jubilee Line , the old line is used regularly to reverse trains when the eastern part of the line is closed due to engineering works . On 9 October 1975 , terrorists belonging to the Provisional Irish Republican Army detonated a bomb outside Green Park tube station , killing a 23-year old Graham Ronald Tuck . Similar attacks during The Troubles resulted in deaths at West Ham station in 1976 and Victoria Station in 1991 . Commencing in May 2009 , the station is undergoing major engineering works to provide step free access lifts from the ticket hall to the Victoria line platforms and a new passageway to the Piccadilly platforms from the lower lift lobby . A further lift will be available from street level to the ticket hall . This will enable the entire station to be accessible without one step . There will also be a new ramp from the ticket hall into the park featuring a living wall . The work is scheduled for completion in spring 2012 . The opening scene of the 1997 film version of Henry James 's The Wings of the Dove was set on the east-bound platforms at both Dover Street and Knightsbridge stations , both represented by the same studio mock-up , complete with a working recreation of a 1906 Stock train . London Buses routes 9 , 14 , 19 , 22 , 38 and C2 serve the station .
Thomas Gainsborough ( christened 14 May 1727 -- 2 August 1788 ) was an English portrait and landscape painter . Thomas Gainsborough was born in Sudbury , Suffolk . He was the youngest son of John Gainsborough , a weaver and maker of woolen goods . At the age of thirteen he impressed his father with his penciling skills so that he let him go to London to study art in 1740 . In London he first trained under engraver Hubert Gravelot but eventually became associated with William Hogarth and his school . One of his mentors was Francis Hayman . In those years he contributed to the decoration of what is now the Thomas Coram Foundation for Children and the supper boxes at Vauxhall Gardens . In the 1740s , Gainsborough married Margaret Burr , an illegitimate daughter of the Duke of Beaufort , who settled a Â # 200 annuity on the couple . The artist 's work , then mainly composed of landscape paintings , was not selling very well . He returned to Sudbury in 1748 -- 1749 and concentrated on the painting of portraits . In 1752 , he and his family , now including two daughters , moved to Ipswich . Commissions for personal portraits increased , but his clientele included mainly local merchants and squires . He had to borrow against his wife 's annuity . In 1759 , Gainsborough and his family moved to Bath . There , he studied portraits by van Dyck and was eventually able to attract a better-paying high society clientele . In 1761 , he began to send work to the Society of Arts exhibition in London ( now the Royal Society of Arts , of which he was one of the earliest members ) ; and from 1769 on , he submitted works to the Royal Academy 's annual exhibitions . He selected portraits of well-known or notorious clients in order to attract attention . These exhibitions helped him acquire a national reputation , and he was invited to become one of the founding members of the Royal Academy in 1769 . His relationship with the academy , however , was not an easy one and he stopped exhibiting his paintings there in 1773 . In 1774 , Gainsborough and his family moved to London to live in Schomberg House , Pall Mall . In 1777 , he again began to exhibit his paintings at the Royal Academy , including portraits of contemporary celebrities , such as the Duke and Duchess of Cumberland . Exhibitions of his work continued for the next six years . In 1780 , he painted the portraits of King George III and his queen and afterwards received many royal commissions . This gave him some influence with the Academy and allowed him to dictate the manner in which he wished his work to be exhibited . However , in 1783 , he removed his paintings from the forthcoming exhibition and transferred them to Schomberg House . In 1784 , royal painter Allan Ramsay died and the King was obliged to give the job to Gainsborough 's rival and Academy president , Joshua Reynolds . Gainsborough remained the Royal Family 's favorite painter , however . At his own express wish , he was buried at St. Anne 's Church , Kew , where the Family regularly worshipped . In his later years , Gainsborough often painted relatively simple , ordinary landscapes . With Richard Wilson , he was one of the originators of the eighteenth-century British landscape school ; though simultaneously , in conjunction with Sir Joshua Reynolds , he was the dominant British portraitist of the second half of the 18th century . He died of cancer on 2 August 1788 at the age of 61 and is interred at St. Anne 's Church , Kew , Surrey ( located on Kew Green ) . He is buried next to Francis Bauer , the famous botanical illustrator . Gainsborough was noted for the speed with which he applied his paint , and he worked more from his observations of nature ( and of human nature ) than from any application of formal academic rules . The poetic sensibility of his paintings caused Constable to say , `` On looking at them , we find tears in our eyes and know not what brings them . '' He himself said , `` I 'm sick of portraits , and wish very much to take my viol-da-gam and walk off to some sweet village , where I can paint landskips ( sic ) and enjoy the fag end of life in quietness and ease . '' His most famous works , such as Portrait of Mrs. Graham ; Mary and Margaret : The Painter 's Daughters ; William Hallett and His Wife Elizabeth , nee Stephen , known as The Morning Walk ; and Cottage Girl with Dog and Pitcher , display the unique individuality of his subjects . Gainsborough 's only known assistant was his nephew , Gainsborough Dupont . In the last year of his life he collaborated with John Hoppner in painting a full length portrait of Charlotte , Countess Talbot .
`` Somewhere Out There '' ( often mistakenly called `` Falling Back To Me '' or `` Gravity '' ) is a 2002 single by Canadian rock band Our Lady Peace from their fifth studio album , Gravity . It was the most successful single from the album , and is also the most internationally successful single ever released by Our Lady Peace . The correct title of the song is indeed `` Somewhere Out There '' , however the specific chorus lyrics `` defying gravity '' and the fact that the album is titled Gravity , led some to believe that the title of the song was `` Gravity '' . The song is mislabeled as such in some search engines , lyric websites , and P2P file-sharing programs . The song is one of Our Lady Peace 's most successful singles to date , having been very popular both in Canada and the United States . Many critics praised the single , but some also criticized it for being `` too mainstream '' , saying that the artistic uniqueness that Our Lady Peace possessed in former albums was absent here . In one of Our Lady Peace 's most recent albums , A Decade , which includes many of Our Lady Peace 's greatest hits , `` Somewhere Out There '' is featured . The song is also featured on Now That 's What I Call Music ! 11 . `` Somewhere Out There '' was culled from two sets of lyrics written by Raine Maida during Christmas , 2001 . `` Bob called me in Toronto the night before Christmas and asked if I had any other song ideas that we should consider before we headed back to Hawaii to finish the album in January , '' he explained . `` The phone call propelled me to write seven new songs during the ten days we had off at Christmas . When we got back to Maui , he combined a verse from one song and a chorus from another and ` Somewhere Out There '' was born . Four versions of the single were released . In the United States and Canada ( SAMPCS11757 ) , a one-track promotional CD was sent to radio stations only . In Europe and Australia , where the single was commercially released on September 9 , 2002 ( Columbia 672965 2 ) , three live bonus tracks , `` Starseed '' , `` Whatever '' , and `` 4 AM '' were included . They were recorded in June 2001 in Syracuse , New York during the Spiritual Machines tour . `` 4 AM '' is sung entirely by the audience . The single was released in Europe on September 16 , 2002 with `` Whatever '' omitted . The fourth version , released in 2003 as part of the promotion for Live , contains the live version of `` Bring Back the Sun '' from that album ( Columbia 79943 ) . The Music Video was directed by Eric Heimbold . It was filmed between April 25 and 26 , 2002 in Montreal . It shows the band performing for fans on a rounded stage lit up in a very dark studio . Most of the video focuses on a woman who climbs to the top of a speaker tower and then throws herself off , being caught by the crowd . The video was officially released on May 22 , 2002 . This is also Steve Mazur 's first appearance in the band since former lead guitarist Mike Turner left to form Fair Ground . In 2007 , the beginning riff of the song was featured in a TV ad for the Fox television network . The song was played during the end credits of the 2005 film White Noise .
Prince Edward , Duke of York ( Edward Augustus ; 25 March 1739 -- 17 September 1767 ) , was the younger brother of George III of the United Kingdom , the second son of Frederick , Prince of Wales and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha . The young prince was baptised Edward Augustus , at Norfolk House , by The Bishop of Oxford , Thomas Secker , and his godparents were his great-uncle The King in Prussia ( for whom The Duke of Queensberry stood proxy ) , The Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb Ã 1\/4 ttel ( who was represented by Lord Carnarvon ) , and his maternal aunt The Duchess of Saxe-Weissenfels ( for whom Lady Charlotte Edwin , a daughter of the late 4th Duke of Hamilton , stood proxy ) . Edward showed an interest in naval affairs and sought permission to serve with the Royal Navy . He participated in the naval descents against the French coast taking part in the failed Raid on St Malo , which ended in the Battle of St. Cast in 1758 . He was created Duke of York and Albany and Earl of Ulster by his paternal grandfather , George II , on 1 April 1760 . When Edward 's brother ascended the throne on 25 October 1760 as George III , he named Edward a privy counsellor . From the time his brother became king and until the birth of the king 's first child , George , Prince of Wales on 12 August 1762 , the duke was heir presumptive to the British throne . In the late summer of 1767 , on his way to Genoa , Edward fell ill and had to be landed in the harbor of Monaco . Despite the care and attention he was given , he died in the Palace of HonorÃ III , Prince of Monaco , on 17 September . The state bedchamber where the ill duke died has since been known as the York Room . After his death , his body was returned to London aboard , and is interred in Westminster Abbey . In 1762 , James Boswell published â The Cub at Newmarketâ , a poem which he dedicated to Prince Edward , without getting his permission . Boswell met the prince at the Newmarket races in 1760 during his first visit to London . The cub referenced in the work is Boswell himself . The dedication reads : Edward was granted use of the arms of the kingdom , differenced by a label argent of five points , the center bearing a cross gules , the other points each bearing a canton gules .

Harry Power ( 1819 â `` 1892 ) was an Australian Bushranger . It is believed , by some , that Ned Kelly served as his accomplice while a teenager . Henry Johnson , also known as Harry Power , was born in Waterford , Ireland on 18 May 1819 and grew up in Ashton-under-Lyne , Lancashire , England , where he worked in the cotton mills . On the 31 August 1840 at the Salford Assizes he was sentenced to transportation for 7 years in Australia for stealing a pair of shoes . They also suspected him of wounding a trooper . He left England on 15 January 1842 and arrived at Hobart aboard the Isabella on 21 May 1842 . He was freed in 1848 and moved to Sydney . By now he was calling himself Harry Power . In 1855 he was arrested for injuring a police officer . It seems that the officer suspected that Power 's horse had been stolen and demanded proof of ownership . Since he did not have any proof , Power wounded the officer and escaped . He was caught and sentenced to 14 years . He was released after serving six years , but was again jailed in 1864 for horse stealing . Escaping from Pentridge Prison in 1869 , the 50-year-old Power turned to highway robbery and became known as a Bushranger . He was highly successful and a reward of Â # 5000 was offered for his capture ( a large sum of money at that time ) . There were claims that during these robberies Power had a youthful assistant who took care of the horses . Suspicion fell on the then 16-year-old Ned Kelly . Power himself was captured on the 5 July 1870 . There is some suggestion that Kelly 's relatives may have betrayed him to the police . He was arrested while on their land . Power was not released from prison until February 1885 , aged 66 . For a while he worked as a tour guide for the old Prison Hulk Success , on which he had once served a sentence , and was by then a museum . In 1892 Harry Power fell in and drowned in the Murray River at Swan Hill , Victoria . Power 's Lookout Reserve near Whitfield , Victoria is named after Harry Power .
Stephen Paul Keirn ( born September 10 , 1951 ) is an American retired professional wrestler . He is best known for being part of the tag team The Fabulous Ones , with Stan Lane , and later for a run in the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) as Skinner , a gimmick that portrayed him as a tobacco spitting alligator hunter from the Everglades . During his time in WWF , Steve was also one of a number of wrestlers to play the role of the masked Doink the Clown . He is currently signed with World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) , and works as President of Florida Championship Wrestling , WWE 's developmental territory , as Steve Keirn . Much of Keirn 's early career was spent wrestling as part of a tag team . While wrestling in Championship Wrestling from Florida ( CWF ) , he held the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship twelve times ; three with Bob Backlund , Jimmy Garvin , and Brian Blair , and nine times with Mike Graham . In addition , the team of Keirn and Graham won the NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship three times . In 1980 and 1981 , Keirn focused on his career as a singles wrestler . He won many titles in Florida and Georgia , including the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Title by defeating Chavo Guerrero Sr. . This title reign was recognized by New Japan Pro Wrestling , as well as the Los Angeles and Florida NWA territories , but not by the NWA as a whole , which considered the title vacant and held a tournament to crown a new champion . The title Keirn held was later renamed the NWA International Junior Heavyweight Title . Keirn also won the NWA National Television Championship twice , defeating Terry Funk and Kevin Sullivan . In 1981 , Keirn began wrestling with the Tennessee-based Continental Wrestling Association ( CWA ) . He was successful as a singles wrestler , winning a tournament to claim the AWA Southern Heavyweight Championship . He also held the NWA Mid-America Heavyweight Championship on two occasions . As in CWF , Keirn found his greatest success in the tag team division . He held the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship 17 times , including 14 reigns as one half of the Fabulous Ones with Stan Lane . Keirn and Lane also teamed to win the CWA World Tag Team Championship twice . The Fabulous Ones competed in various promotions over the next decade . In 1984 , the team won the Southwest Championship Wrestling World Tag Team Championship while wrestling in Australia . In the United States , they won the NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship twice . In 1991 , the pair wrestled in the United States Wrestling Association , defeating Tony Anthony and Doug Gilbert to win the USWA Tag Team Championship . In the summer of 1991 , Keirn debuted in the WWF as Skinner , an alligator hunter from the Florida Everglades . He was portrayed as a generally nasty individual , always chewing on tobacco and sometimes spitting it on his opponent . He carried an alligator claw to the ring with him , which he would often use as a weapon against his opponents . He competed in the 1991 King of the Ring tournament , defeating Virgil in the first round but losing to Bret Hart in the second round . While still being billed as undefeated , he challenged Hart for the WWF Intercontinental Championship at This Tuesday in Texas on December 3 , 1991 but lost by submission . At WrestleMania VIII , Skinner was defeated in one minute and eleven seconds by Owen Hart . While in the WWF , Keirn also portrayed Doink the Clown on occasion . At WrestleMania IX , Keirn helped the original Doink defeat Crush by attacking Crush dressed as Doink during the match . Along with Bobby Eaton , Keirn wrestled in World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) in 1994 in a tag team known as `` Bad Attitude '' . Despite the tag team success both Keirn and Eaton enjoyed in the past ( with The Fabulous Ones and the Midnight Express respectively ) , the team made little impact , losing dark matches to Brian and Brad Armstrong at Bash at the Beach 1994 and Fall Brawl 1994 . While in WCW , Keirn was also involved in an angle in which masked men attacked Hulk Hogan . Several times in October 1994 , Keirn wore a black mask to attack Hogan during and after Hogan 's matches . Since the late 1980s , Keirn has run a wrestling school to train wrestlers . Originally located in Tampa , Florida , Keirn 's `` Professional Wrestling School of Hard Knocks '' is now located in Brandon , Florida . Keirn helped train many wrestlers , including Mike Awesome , Dennis Knight , Joe `` Destiny '' Clapp , Diamond Dallas Page , Dustin Rhodes and Tracy Smothers . The school has since been incorporated into the WWE 's developmental territory , Florida Championship Wrestling ( FCW ) . Keirn makes regular appearances on the FCW television show where he is referred to as the President of FCW .

The airport is owned by the City of Monroe and is located three nautical miles ( 6 km ) east of its central business district . The airport is advertised as the birthplace of Delta Air Lines ; the airport 's logo is a variant on the Delta logo . During World War II , the United States Army Air Force Flying Training Command used the airport as a cadet training center beginning in August 1942 . The airport was named Selman Army Airfield , named after a Navy Pilot , Lieutenant Augustus J. Selman , U.S.N. , a native of Monroe , LA , died at Norfolk , VA , on November 28 , 1921 , of injuries received in an airplane crash in the line of duty The Army Air Force Pre-Flight School ( Bomber-Navigation ) transferred to Selman AAF from Maxwell Field , Alabama .

Selman Field was the largest navigation school in the United States in its time and the nation 's only complete navigation courseâ '' from start to finishâ '' during World War II . Of the hundreds of fields that were operated by the Army Air Forces , it was only at Selman that a cadet could get his entire trainingâ '' pre-flight and advancedâ '' and wind up with a commission and navigators wings without ever leaving the field . Over 15,000 navigators were trained at Selman Field , who flew in every theater of operations during the war . The vast majority of aircraft flown at Selman AAF were Beech C-45s , also known as the AT-7 . BT-13s were flown for basic flying training , and TC-47 and TC-46s were used beginning in late 1944 . It closed on until 1 September 1945 . After that Selman AAF was used as a separation center for returning overseas personnel until being inactivated on 31 May 1946 .

Lorca is a town in southeast Spain , in the autonomous community of Murcia and 36 miles SW of the city of Murcia . It has a population of 90,924 ( year 2008 ) , up from the 2001 census total of 77,477 . Lorca is the municipality with the second-largest surface area ( after CÃ ceres ) in Spain with 1,675.21 kmÂ ( 646.8 sq mi ) . The region around Lorca was already inhabited by the Iberians during the Bronze age ( El Argar culture ) . Lorca was probably called Eliocroca by the Romans and Lurka by the Arabs . The old part of the town , made up of narrow streets and alley-ways , achieved its present shape under Islamic rule . During the Reconquista , Lorca was a dangerous border town , caught between the Spanish kingdom of Castile and the Moorish kingdom of Granada . The square tower of homage of the town fortress can be seen from many points of the town . It was named Torre Alfonsina after King Alfonso X of Castile .

Note that the number 4 000 000 is an obvious error . The Los Cipreses archaeological park include findings from the Bronze Age El Argar culture . After most of the land and water supplies had been held for centuries by a minority of landowners and by Roman Catholic religious orders , Lorca began a period of sluggish economic growth during the 1960s . Still today , its economy is largely based on agriculture and stockbreeding ( pigs and brown cows ) , although its service industries make it the commercial capital of the surrounding area . It also has saltpeter , gunpowder , and lead-smelting works . In recent years , Lorca has experienced a population growth because of peasant immigration , mostly coming from Ecuador and Morocco . Lorca formed around the GuadalentÃ n river ( in Arabic `` mud river '' ) in a quite arid valley . In fact , agriculture heavily depends on water transferred from the Tagus river in Central Spain .
The 1986 Formula One season was the 37th FIA Formula One World Championship season . It commenced on March 23 , 1986 , and ended on October 26 after sixteen races . The season culminated in a points battle between the Williams duo of Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell versus McLaren 's Alain Prost at the final race , the 1986 Australian Grand Prix . Mansell 's tyre blew in spectacular fashion and Piquet , in the lead at the time of the incident , was brought in for an unscheduled pit stop soon afterward by Williams to prevent the same happening to his tyres . This enabled Prost to secure his second consecutive drivers championship . For the first ( and to date only ) year , turbocharged engines were compulsory due to a ban on naturally aspirated ( atmospheric ) engines . The law banning atmospheric engines was rescinded in 1987 , in preparation for a ban on all forced induction engines for 1989 . Forget everything after . The 1986 turbo Formula One cars ... really were rockets . And to handle them , I think , you had to be a man . - Gerhard Berger Drivers did not finish the Grand Prix , but were classified as they completed over 90 % of the race distance . Drivers ' Championship points were awarded on a 9-6-4-3-2-1 basis to the top six finishers in each round .

Montgomery County ( county code MG ) is a county located in southeast Kansas , in the Central United States . As of the 2010 census , the county population was 35,471 . Its county seat is Independence , and its most populous city is Coffeyville . The Coffeyville Micropolitan Statistical Area includes all of Montgomery County . Montgomery County was established February 26 , 1867 . It was named in honor of Richard Montgomery , an American Revolutionary War general killed in 1775 while attempting to capture Quebec City , in Canada , after successfully capturing two forts and the city of Montreal . When Kansas was admitted to the Union as a state in 1861 , the Osage Indian reservation occupied a large tract of land near the southern border . The reservation had been established in 1825 . After the Civil War ended , the Osage lands were coveted as the largest and last reserve of good land in the eastern part of the state . As early as 1866 , the Osages were forced to cede tracts at the eastern and northern edges of the reservation . This treaty conceded white settlement on land in the eastern part of what is now Montgomery County . For a brief time , the Osages attempted to maintain a boundary at the Verdigris River . The Verdigris flows from north to south through the center of Montgomery County . From the west the Elk River joins the Verdigris at a confluence slightly northwest of the geographical center of the county . In 1867 Frank and Fred Bunker established a primitive cattle camp on the west side of the Verdigris south of the confluence . Like the Osages , the Bunkers thought they were beyond the boundaries of civilization . Early in 1869 , however , settlers began to cross the Verdigris River , `` at first under protest of the Indians , but the immense throng of settlers soon made all protests futile . '' Montgomery County was surveyed and organized in 1869 ; the governor appointed commissioners June 3 .

LeÃ nidas , born in Rio de Janeiro , started his career at SÃ # o CristÃ vÃ # o. In 1931 and in 1932 , he played for Bonsucesso . He joined PeÃ arol in Uruguay in 1933 . After one year , he came back to Brazil to play for Vasco da Gama . He helped them win the Rio State Championship . After playing in the World Cup in 1934 he joined Botafogo and won another Rio State Championship in 1935 . On the following year , he joined Flamengo , where he stayed until 1941 . Once again , in 1939 , he won Rio State Championship . He also fought prejudice , being one of the first black players to join the then-elitist Flamengo team . Leonidas joined SÃ # o Paulo in 1942 and stayed at the club until his retirement from playing in 1950 . LeÃ nidas is regarded to be the inventor of the `` Bicycle Kick '' . He self entitled himself as the inventor of it . Although some say it was invented by another Brazilian player : Pretonilho de Brito , and that LeÃ nidas only perfected it . The first time LeÃ nidas used this technique was on April 24 , 1932 , in a match between Bonsucesso and Carioca . In Flamengo he used this play only once , in 1939 , against Argentinian team Independiente . The unusual volley gained huge fame at the time , propelling it into the football mainstream . For SÃ # o Paulo he used the bicycle kick in two opportunities : the first one on June 14 , 1942 , in the defeat against Palestra Italia ( current Palmeiras ) . Most famous of all , he used it on November 13 , 1948 , in the massive 8 â `` 0 victory over Juventus . The play ( and the goal ) was captured in an image and is regarded to be the most famous picture of the player . In the 1938 World Cup , he also used the bicycle kick , which delighted the watching spectators . When he did it , the referee was so shocked by the volley that he was unsure whether it was within the rules or not . He played 19 times for the Brazilian national team , scoring 21 goals . He scored twice on his debut for the Brazilian national team . In 1938 , he was the World Cup 's top scorer with 7 goals , scoring at least three times in the 6 â `` 5 extra time win over Poland . Brazil manager Adhemar Pimenta decided to rest him for the semi-final against Italy . The Italians won the game 2 â `` 1 . The scores contain links to the article on the 1934 FIFA World Cup and the round in question . The matchesâ numbers reflect the number of World Cup matches LeÃ nidas played during his career . The scores contain links to the article on the 1938 FIFA World Cup and the round in question . When there is an special article on the match in question , the link is in the column for round . He joined SÃ # o Paulo as manager in 1953 , before leaving football to become a radio reporter and then the owner of a furniture store in SÃ # o Paulo . LeÃ nidas died in 2004 in Cotia , SÃ # o Paulo , because of complications due to Alzheimer 's disease , from which he had been suffering since 1974 . He is buried in the CemitÃ rio Morada da Paz of SÃ # o Paulo .

They are linked to the uplift , erosion and surface weathering of previously deposited sediments and require conditions similar to primary and diagenetic red beds for their formation . Wesel is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia , Germany . It is the capital of the Wesel district . Wesel is situated at the confluence of the Lippe River and the Rhine . Suburbs of Wesel include Lackhausen , Obrighoven , Ginderich , Feldmark , BÃ 1\/4 derich , FlÃ 1\/4 ren and Blumenkamp . The city originated from a Franconian manor that was first recorded in the 8th century . In the 12th century , the Duke of ClÃ ves took possession of Wesel . The city became a member of the Hanseatic League during the 15th century . Within the Duchy of Cleves , Wesel was second only to Cologne in the lower Rhine region as an entrepÃ t. It was an important commercial center : a clearing station for the transshipment and trading of goods . In 1590 the Spanish captured Wesel after a four-year siege . The city changed hands between the Dutch and Spanish several times during the Eighty Years War . In 1672 a French force under Louis II de Bourbon , Prince de CondÃ captured the city . Wesel was inherited by the Hohenzollerns of the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1609 but they were unable to take control of Wesel until the Treaty of Nijmegen in 1678 . Although the city had been heavily fortified the Prussians evacuated the city during the Seven Years War and it was occupied by the French . It was returned to Prussia at the end of the war . Friedrich Wilhelm von Dossow was the Prussian Governor of Wesel during the 18th century . Wesel was ceded to the French in 1805 under the Treaty of SchÃ nbrunn . The French heavily fortified the city constructing a rectangular fort called the Citadelle Napoleon at BÃ 1\/4 derich and the Citadelle Bonaparte on an island in the Rhine off Wesel . Though blockaded by the Allies in 1813 the city remained in French hands until after the Battle of Waterloo . After the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century , the city became part of the Prussian Rhine Province and the Citadelle Napoleon was renamed Fort BlÃ 1\/4 cher . During World War II , as a strategic depot , Wesel became a target of Allied bombing . On the 16 , 17 and 19 February 1945 , the town was attacked with impact and air-burst bombs , which destroyed 97 % of the city . The Wehrmacht blew up bridges along the Rhine and Lippe to prevent Allied forces from advancing . The Wehrmacht also destroyed the 1,950m-long railway bridge , the last Rhine bridge remaining in German hands , on 10 March . On 23 March , Wesel came under the fire of over 3,000 guns when it was bombarded anew , in preparation for Operation Plunder . The shelling was assisted by a raid of RAF bombers and a larger raid that night . At 2100 hours on the 23rd , ten individual bombers each dropped a 10,000 kg bomb on Wesel , the heaviest bombs dropped in World War II ( p. 141 Kurowski , Hitler 's Last Bastion ) . Before the town was finally taken by Allied troops , 97 % of its structures were destroyed . In the ensuing attacks by Allied forces , the town was taken for minimal casualties . Operation Varsity - the largest airborne landings of the war - dropped 18,000 troops into the area to take the hills behind Wesel . The British 1st Commando Brigade was already attacking Wesel carried into action by LVT Buffalos . The remainder of the Allied force crossed the Rhine in more amphibious vehicles . From almost 25,000 in 1939 , the population was reduced to 1,900 by May 1945 . In 1946 Wesel became part of the new state North Rhine-Westphalia of West Germany . One of Germany 's highest radio masts is situated in the district of BÃ 1\/4 derich on the left bank of the Rhine .
His style of writing is said to be unequaled among the Fathers of the Church . The Flag of Cyprus came into use on August 16 , 1960 under the ZÃ 1\/4 rich and London Agreements , whereby a constitution was drafted and Cyprus was proclaimed an independent state . The national flag features a map of the entirety of the island , with two olive branches below ( a symbol of peace ) on white ( another symbol of peace ) . The olive branches signify peace between the Turks and Greeks . The map on the flag is a copper-orange color , symbolizing the large deposits of copper ore on the island ( chiefly in the form of chalcopyrite , which is yellow in color ) , from which it may have received its name . Cyprus was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1571 , which initiated Turkish settlement on the island . It then fell under British control in 1878 . The flag , adopted at independence in 1960 , deliberately chose peaceful and neutral symbols in an attempt to indicate harmony between the rival Greek and Turkish communities , an ideal that has not yet been realized . In 1974 , Turkish forces invaded and occupied the northern part of the island , forming the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus , a de-facto state recognized only by Turkey and the non sovereign Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in Azerbaijan . They also introduced a flag similar to the Turkish , with inverted colors and two red stripes . The part which is occupied by the Turkish forces also tends to fly the national flag of Turkey , whilst in southern Cyprus , the national flag of Greece is often used together with the flag of Cyprus . Before the flag of Cyprus was introduced , the flags of Greece and Turkey were used . The current flag was created as the result of a design competition in 1960 . Under the constitution , the flag should not include either blue or red colors ( the colors of the flag of Greece and the flag of Turkey ) , nor portray a cross or a crescent . All participants deliberately avoided use of these four elements in an attempt to make the flag `` neutral '' . The winning design was based on a proposal by Ä smet GÃ 1\/4 ney , a Turkish Cypriot painter . The design was chosen by Makarios III , the first President of the Republic , with the consent of Fazil KÃ 1\/4 Ã Ã 1\/4 k , the first Vice-President . Under the constitution of Cyprus , the flag of Cyprus may be flown by state institutions , public corporations , and citizens of the country . State institutions , public bodies and corporations may fly the flag of Cyprus along with both the flag of Greece and the flag of Turkey . Private citizens may fly the flag of Cyprus alongside either the Greek flag , the Turkish flag , or both . Despite the attempt at a neutral design to promote unity amongst the constituent communities , this flag is most often used only by the Greek Cypriots , since it is associated by the Turkish Cypriots with the Greek-dominated Republic of Cyprus . Following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and the establishment of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus , Turkish-Cypriots use the Flag of Northern Cyprus . ( See also Flag of India , Flag of Ireland , and Flag of Bosnia-Herzegovina . ) The color of the map is copper ( Pantone 144-C ) . Both the crest and the two olive-tree leaves are olive green ( Pantone 336-C ) . The background is white . Ratio : 3:5 Flags produced on Cyprus often differ from the original specifications , both regarding the size of the map and the colors used . The government announced in October 2005 , that it would take steps to `` start from scratch '' and assure that only flags complying with the official specifications would be produced . Under the terms of the Annan Plan for Cyprus , a United Nations proposal to settle the Cyprus dispute , a new national flag would have been adopted by a reconstituted confederal republic of Cyprus . Unlike the current official flag , this version consciously incorporates colors representing Greece ( blue ) and Turkey ( red ) alongside a large copper-yellow band for Cyprus ; the heraldic blazon is per fess Azure and Gules , a Spanish fess Or fimbriated Argent .

Neuss is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia , Germany . It is located on the west bank of the Rhine opposite DÃ 1\/4 sseldorf , and owes its success to its location at the crossing of historic and modern trade routes . Neuss was founded by the Romans in 16 BC as a military fortification ( castra ) with the current city to the north of the castra , on the confluence of the rivers Rhine and Erft , with the name of Novaesium . Later a civil settlement was founded in the area of today 's center of the town during the 1st century AD . Novaesium , together with Trier ( Augusta Treverorum ) , is one of the three oldest Roman settlements in Germany . 451 settled by Huns . Neuss grew during the Middle Ages because of its prime location on several routes , by the crossing of the great Rhine valley , and with its harbor and ferry . During the 10th century , the remains of the martyr and tribune Saint Quirinus , not to be confused with the Roman god Quirinus , had been relocated to Neuss . This resulted in pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Quirinus even from countries beyond the borders of the Holy Roman Empire . Neuss was first documented as a town in 1138 . One of the main events in the town 's history is the siege of the town in 1474 â `` 75 by Charles the Bold , Duke of Burgundy , that lasted for nearly a year . The citizens of Neuss withstood the siege and were therefore rewarded by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III . The town was granted the right to mint its own coins and to carry the imperial coat of arms , the imperial eagle and the crown , in the town 's own coat of arms . Neuss became a member of the Hanseatic League , although it was never accepted by the other members of the League . In 1586 , more than two-thirds of the city was destroyed by fire , and several wars during the reign of King Louis XIV of France resulted in worsening finances for Neuss . Its importance as a place for trading declined rapidly , and from the mid-17th century onwards , Neuss became a place only important for its agriculture . Until the late 18th century , Neuss belonged to the Electorate of Cologne . From 1794 to 1814 , Neuss was part of France during the reign of Napoleon . In 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars , Neuss became part of the Kingdom of Prussia , and was reorganized as a district with the municipalities of Neuss , Dormagen , Nettesheim , Nievenheim , Rommerskirchen and Zons . The town had a population of 6,333 at that time . It was part of the Prussian Province of JÃ 1\/4 lich-Cleves-Berg ( 1815 â `` 22 ) and its successor , the Rhine Province ( 1822 â `` 1946 ) . Neuss regained its economic power in the 19th century , with expansion of the harbor in 1835 , and increasing industrial activity . The city 's boundaries were expanded in 1881 . Neuss became part of the new state of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946 . In 1968 the spelling of the name was changed from NeuÃ to Neuss . In 1975 the town of Neuss and the district of Grevenbroich were joined to form the district of Rhein-Kreis Neuss with a population of 440,000 and its seat of government in Neuss .
Damages and deaths from a storm include when the storm was a precursor wave or extratropical low . `` The Saga Begins '' is a parody by `` Weird Al '' Yankovic of `` American Pie '' by Don McLean , released from the 1999 album Running with Scissors , and later appearing on the compilation album entitled The Saga Begins . The title derives from a tagline that appeared in teaser trailers and the film poster for Star Wars Episode I : The Phantom Menace : `` Every saga has a beginning '' . Set to the tune of `` American Pie , '' `` The Saga Begins '' recounts the plot of Star Wars Episode I : The Phantom Menace , from Obi-Wan Kenobi 's point of view . Yankovic gathered most of the information he needed to write the song from Internet spoilers . Although LucasFilm declined a request for an advance screening , Yankovic eventually attended a costly pre-screening for charity . He did such an accurate job that after the pre-screening , he ended up making only very minor alterations . McLean not only approved the song but also has said since that his children have played it so much that he has a tendency to accidentally sing Yankovic 's lyrics when performing `` American Pie '' in concert . According to Yankovic 's official website , Lucasfilms ' official response to the song was , `` You should 've seen the smile on George Lucas face . '' This is the second Star Wars song Weird Al has created , with the first being Yoda . The video begins in a desert , presumably on the planet Tatooine . Yankovic , dressed like Obi-Wan Kenobi as a Padawan , walks until he comes across Darth Sidious playing the piano . Yankovic uses the Force to get a resonator guitar , and in the second verse he reappears performing in a Mos Eisley Cantina . In the last verse , he returns to the desert , and in the last chorus , numerous `` Obi-Wan '' clones sing as a group . The song was played frequently on Radio Disney and later released on Radio Disney Jams Volume 2 . Radio Disney took issue with his line `` Do you see him hitting on the queen ? '' and removed it ( so that the song skipped slightly ) . Yankovic , who usually does n't like to change lyrics to suit other 's needs , provided Radio Disney with an updated version , having changed the words to `` Do you see him talking to the queen ? ''

A merchet was a fine paid on a marriage during the Middle Ages in England . The word derives from the plural form of daughter , merched , in old Welsh . A peasant would pay a merchet to his lord upon the marriage of a woman . The justification for this was that when a woman married , her lord was losing a worker . Usually the bride 's father would pay , as buying the right to give his daughter away .

Mercy ( Middle English , from Anglo-French merci , from Medieval Latin merced - , merces , from Latin , `` price paid , wages '' , from merc - , merxi `` merchandise '' ) can refer both to compassionate behavior on the part of those in power ( e.g. mercy shown by a judge toward a convict ) , on the part of a humanitarian third party ( e.g. a mission of mercy aiming to treat war victims ) or divine mercy shown to the penitent . Mercy is a word used to describe compassion shown by one person or to come on another , or a request from one person to another to be shown such leniency or unwarranted compassion for a crime or wrongdoing . Some of the earliest recorded expressions of divine mercy are found in Ancient Egyptian literature . One of the basic virtues of chivalry , Christian ethics , Islam , and Judaism , it is also related to concepts of justice and morality in behavior between people . In a legal sense , a defendant having been found guilty of a capital crime may ask for clemency from being executed . To be `` mercy '' , the behavior generally can not be compelled by outside forces . A famous literary example is from The Merchant of Venice when Portia asks Shylock to show mercy . He asks , On what compulsion , must I ? She responds : The quality of mercy is not strained . It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath . It is twice blest : It blesseth him that gives and him that takes . Tis mightiest in the mightiest ; it becomes The throned monarch better than his crown . His scepter shows the force of temporal power , The attribute to awe and majesty , Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings . But mercy is above this sceptered sway ; It is enthroned in the hearts of kings ; It is an attribute of God himself ; And earthly power doth then show like God 's When mercy seasons justice . A number of organizations ( e.g. Mercy Corps , the Sisters of Mercy , Mercyful Fate and the Temple of Mercy and Charity ) use the word `` mercy '' in their name to describe their work . Ethicist Jacob Appel has noted a decline of mercy , and a concomitant increase in retribution , in American public life . Appel has written :
There are many ways of categorizing telescopes , and within major classifications , there are usually many variations due to professional , amateur , and commercial sub-types . Telescopes can be classified by optical design , such as refracting telescopes . Telescopes can also be classified by where they are place , such as space telescopes . One major determining factor is type of light , or particle being observed including devices referred to as `` telescopes '' that do not form an image or use optics . Some telescopes are classified by the task they perform ; for example Solar telescopes are all designs that look at the Sun , Dobsonian telescopes are designed to be low cost and portable , Aerial telescopes overcame the optical shortcomings of 17th century objective lenses , etc. optical telescopes can be classified by three primary optical designs ( refractor , reflector , or catadioptric ) , by sub-designs of these types , or by the task they perform . They all have their different advantages and disadvantages and they are used in different areas of professional and amateur astronomy . Optical and other types of telescopes are mounted on different types of mounts .

A slingshotâ '' also called a shanghai , a catapult ( in British English ) , and a beanshooter ( in the Southern U.S. ) â '' is a small hand-powered projectile weapon . The forked Y-shaped frame has two rubber strips attached to the uprights , leading back to a pocket for holding the projectile . It is normally shot by holding the frame in the dominant hand , extended at arms length . The pocket is then gripped between thumb and forefinger of the non-dominant hand , pulled back to near the cheek , aimed and the pocket released to shoot the projectile toward the target . Home-made slingshots were popular children 's toys for much of the 20th century because the low projectile velocity was generally considered to be safe . However , it is possible to construct a slingshot with sufficient power to cause serious bodily harm . A basic slingshot can be made simply with a rubber band , stretched by one 's fingers , and a small projectile such as folded paper or a pebble . Although the simple forked stick and rubber models are still made by children and adults , there are now a range of commercial models , some sophisticated and powerful . There are many professional catapult makers in the UK , and many people collect them . Custom catapults are made from various materials : buffalo horn , deer antler , exotic hardwoods , etc. . Most slingshots are made from wood . Custom-made catapults are sometimes made in the style of the famous MILBRO catapult of the 1950s . Many powerful commercial slingshots now have a wrist-brace , and some models have stabilizers , rotating prongs , sighting mechanisms , and other sophisticated improvements . While these are not necessary they usually improve accuracy , and the power and lifespan of the bands . The elastic material is critical . The best widely-available materials are dipped latex rubber , surgical tubing , and latex sheeting , which last about 6 months before they need to be replaced . They can be attached to the frame and packet by stretching them over a metal rod of the correct diameter . Some slingshots are constructed of metal tubing . Many types of rubber are used , but there are three main varieties : square , tube , and flatbands . Among the makes of flatband material are linatex , theraband and latex . These materials were designed for various medical and industrial uses and have been adapted for catapult use . Usually , the flat band material is tapered from 3\/4 '' to 1\/2 '' , and about 5 '' long . A slingshot can be powerful enough to hunt game such as small rodents and birds at ranges up to 25 meters . A typical heavy pull band slingshot should be used with 9 mm ( 3\/8 '' ) to 12 mm ( 1\/2 '' ) steel balls . Using lighter ammunition does n't increase the speed of the projectile significantly . Fishing slingshots are sometimes used by anglers to project ground-bait into areas which they otherwise would not be able to reach . Slingshots may also be used in recreational paintball games as backup weapon ( Slingshot paintball ) . Even though the average velocity and range of a slingshot are usually less than that of a paintball gun , some paintball playing fields may not allow them . Slingshots have been used as a military weapon , but primarily by guerrilla forces due to the primitive resources and technology required to construct one . Such guerrilla groups included the Irish Republican Army ; prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq , Saddam Hussein released a propaganda video demonstrating slingshots as a possible weapon for insurgents to use against invading forces . Slingshots have also been used by the military to launch micro unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) . One notable example of this is the AeroVironment Wasp UAV . The vehicle was propelled to high speeds by using a Saunders Wrist-Rocket Pro slingshot .
Bronllys is a village in Powys , Wales between the nearby towns Brecon and Talgarth . It has recently benefitted from a new bypass as part of the Talgarth Relief Road and Bronllys Bypass scheme . The village offers a range of services from a petrol station and DIY shop to a Tex Mex restaurant and embroidery and printwear shop . Despite being a tiny village it even has its own swimming pool and small leisure center . Bronllys castle is a motte and bailey fortress standing just outside of Talgarth . The castle was founded in or soon after 1144 when the district was granted to Walter de Clifford by Roger Fitzmiles , 2nd Earl of Hereford . Walter seems to have been responsible for building the round tower on the motte for in 1165 it caught fire and a stone tumbling from the battlements killed Earl Roger 's last surviving brother Mahel de Hereford . In September 1233 Walter III de Clifford had a force of over 200 men here defending the castle against his father-in-law Llywelyn ab Iorwerth . The castle passed from the Cliffords to the Giffards and eventually the de Bohun Earls of Hereford . The castle was additionally fortified against Owain GlyndÅ r during the early years of his rebellion in the early 15th century . The minor Welsh bard Bedo Brwynllys lived in Bronllys in the 15th century . His poetry is characteristic of a follower or imitator of Dafydd ap Gwilym and is mainly love poetry or religious poetry and some eulogistic poems such as his elegy for Sir Richard Herbert of Coldbrook , written in 1469 .
Shawarma , is a sandwich-like wrap of shaved lamb , goat , chicken , turkey , beef , or a mixture thereof . The meat is placed on a spit , and may be grilled for as long as a day . Shawarma is a fast-food staple across the Arab world , Europe and the Caucasus . Shawarma is eaten with pita bread , Lavash bread , tabbouleh salad , fattoush salad , taboon bread , tomato and cucumber . Toppings include tahini , hummus , pickled turnips and amba . Shawarma is shared by many country variations . In Greece , it is called gyros , meaning `` turned '' . In Armenian , it is `` Tarna '' , literally meaning `` to turn '' , and in Turkish it is called dÃ ner kebab , which in turn means `` turning kebab '' . The word shawarma comes from the Turkish word Ã evirme , meaning turning . Shawarma is made by alternately stacking strips of fat and pieces of seasoned meat ( beef , lamb or marinated chicken ) on a stickâ '' an onion or tomato is sometimes placed at the top of the stack for additional flavoring . The meat is roasted slowly on all sides as the spit rotates in front of , or over , a flame for hours ( see rotisserie ) . Traditionally a wood fire was used ; currently , a gas flame is common . While specialty restaurants might offer two or more meat selections , some establishments have just one skewer . While cooking , the meat is shaved off the stack with a large knife , an electric knife or a small circular saw , dropping to a circular tray below to be retrieved . Shawarma is eaten as a fast food , made up into a sandwich wrap with pita bread or rolled up in an Armenian Lavash flatbread together with vegetables and dressing . A variety of vegetables come with the shawarma which include : cucumber , onion , tomato , lettuce , eggplant , parsley , pickled turnips , pickled gherkins , and cabbage . You have the option to get French fries in some countries including : Jordan , Syria , , Lebanon , Israel , Turkey , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , also countries in Europe such as Romania , Bulgaria and even the U.K. Dressings include : tahini ( or tahina ) , Amba sauce ( pickled mango with Chilbeh ) , hummus , or flavored with vinegar and spices such as cardamom , cinnamon , and nutmeg . Chicken shawarma is served with garlic mayonnaise , toum ( garlic sauce ) , pomegranate concentrate , or skhug ( a hot chili sauce ) . Once the shawarma is made , it might be dipped in the fat dripping from the skewer and then briefly seared against the flame . In Jordan , Israel , Syria and Lebanon , chicken shawarma is toasted upon request in specialty restaurants , whereas those made of lamb or beef are immediately served and eaten . Beef can be used for shawarma instead of lamb , and turkey is used instead of chicken . In Saudi Arabia , goat is as common as beef or lamb . Less common alternatives include fish and sausage . Some shawarma stores use hot dog buns or baguettes , but most have pita and lavash . Sometimes , beef shawarma -- despite its name -- contains some lamb in addition to the beef , to ensure juiciness . In some regions of Canada , the term `` shawarma '' is interchangeable with donairs . In the Montreal region , chicken `` shawarma '' is often confused with chicken kebabs , known as `` Shish taouk '' .

`` The Highwayman '' is a narrative poem written by Alfred Noyes , first published in the August 1906 issue of Blackwood 's Magazine . The following year it was included in Noyes ' collection , Forty Singing Seamen and Other Poems , becoming an immediate success . The poem , set in 18th century England , tells the story of a nameless highwayman who is in love with Bess , a landlord 's ( innkeeper ) daughter . Betrayed to the authorities by a jealous ostler ( stableman ) , the highwayman escapes ambush when Bess sacrifices her life to warn him . Learning of her death he dies himself in a futile attempt at revenge , shot down on the highway . In the final stanza , the ghosts of the lovers meet again on winter nights . The poem was written on the edge of a desolate stretch of land in West Surrey known as Bagshot Heath , where Noyes , then aged twenty-four , had taken rooms in a cottage . In his autobiography , he recalled : `` Bagshot Heath in those days was a wild bit of country , all heather and pinewoods . The Highwayman suggested itself to me one blustery night when the sound of the wind in the pines gave me the first line . '' The poem was completed in about two days . The poem makes effective use of vivid imagery for the background and of repetitious phrases to create the sense of a horseman riding at ease through the rural darkness to a lovers ' tryst or of soldiers marching down the same road to ambush him . `` The Highwayman '' is reputed to be `` the best narrative poem in existence for oral delivery '' . Almost half a century later , Noyes wrote : `` I think the success of the poem ... was due to the fact that it was not an artificial composition , but was written at an age when I was genuinely excited by that kind of romantic story . '' The poem was adapted as a cantata for mixed voices and orchestra by American composer Deems Taylor in 1914 , first performed at the MacDowell Festival , Peterborough , N.H. , with E.G. Hood as director , and the famous baritone Reinald Werrenrath , as soloist . In 1933 , a setting of the poem for chorus ( SATB ) and small orchestra by the English composer C. Armstrong Gibbs received its first performance at Winchester College Music School . In 1951 , the poem was used as the basis for a feature-length Hollywood film of the same name , starring Philip Friend and Wanda Hendrix . Noyes writes in his autobiography that he was pleasantly surprised by `` the fact that in this picture , produced in Hollywood , the poem itself is used and followed with the most artistic care '' . In 1965 , Phil Ochs composed a musical interpretation and recorded the poem ( missing out a few verses ) set to this music on his second album I Ai n't Marching Anymore . In 1979 , UK singer-songwriter John Otway performed a version of the poem set to a musical backdrop , for his album Where Did I Go Right . In 1981 , British illustrator Charles Keeping produced a version of the poem that received the Kate Greenaway Medal ( given for an outstanding work of illustration in children 's literature ) . The video of the 1988 Fleetwood Mac song `` Everywhere '' is a visual depiction of the Noyes poem . In 1997 , Loreena McKennitt used an adapted version of the poem ( three verses were omitted ) for track # 5 , `` The Highwayman '' , in her album The Book of Secrets . Her setting of the poem has been covered by Irish musician Andy Irvine . In 2002 , the American author Deborah Ballou published The Highwayman : A Novel Inspired by Alfred Noyes ' Poem . The Scottish children 's author Nicola Morgan used the poem as the background for her historical novels , The Highwayman 's Footsteps and The Highwayman 's Curse , published in 2006 and 2007 respectively .

PyrÃ nÃ es-Orientales is a department of southern France adjacent to the northern Spanish frontier and the Mediterranean Sea . It also surrounds the tiny Spanish enclave of LlÃ via , and thus has two distinct borders with Spain . Prior to the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659 , most of the present department was part of the former Principality of Catalonia , within the Crown of Aragon , so the majority of it has historically been Catalan-speaking , and it is still sometimes referred to as Northern Catalonia . The modern department was created early during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790 , through the application of a law dated 22 December 1789 . PyrÃ nÃ es-Orientales corresponds almost exactly to the pre-Revolutionary province of Roussillon , but it also includes Fenolheda , a small piece of territory which had formerly been on the southern edge of Languedoc . See also : French Cerdagne . Invaded by Spain in April 1793 , the area was recaptured thirteen months later during the War of the Roussillon . During the nineteenth century , PyrÃ nÃ es-Orientales proved one of the most consistently republican departments in France . The intellectual and republican politician FranÃ ois Arago , who , during the early months of the short-lived Second Republic in 1848 , was briefly de facto Head of state , came from Estagel in the east of the department . The dÃ partement is managed by the General Council of the PyrÃ nÃ es-Orientales in Perpignan . The PyrÃ nÃ es-Orientales is part of the region of Languedoc-Roussillon . The General Council of the PyrÃ nÃ es-Orientales is more and more involved with the European Union to create with the Generalitat of Catalonia , and Andorra , a Catalan Eurodistrict . PyrÃ nÃ es-Orientales has an area of 4,115 kmÂ . and a population of 422,000 , of whom just over a quarter live in the capital , Perpignan . Other towns include ArgelÃ s-sur-Mer , Thuir , Elne ( the ancient Illiberis ) and Prades , each of 6-10 ,000 inhabitants . PyrÃ nÃ es-Orientales consists of three river valleys in the Pyrenees mountain range â `` from north to south , those of the Agly , TÃ t and Techâ `` and the eastern Plain of Roussillon into which they converge . Most of the population and agricultural production are concentrated in the plain , with only 30 % of the area . There is one water reservoir at Lac de Matemale . The upper Tech valley comprises the departments westernmost third , with just over a tenth of the total population . To the south-east , the TÃ t valley and the CÃ te Vermeille contain nearly 100,000 inhabitants . The Agly basin in the north-east has much in common with neighboring areas of Aude . LlÃ via is a town of Cerdanya , province of Girona , Catalonia , Spain , that forms a Spanish exclave surrounded by French territory . PyrÃ nÃ es-Orientales is a wine-growing area and a tourist destination . French is spoken by almost all the population . Minority languages in the region are Catalan and Occitan , which between them are estimated to be spoken by rather more than a quarter of the population and understood by more than 40 % . On 10 December 2007 , the General Council of the PyrÃ nÃ es-Orientales recognized Catalan as a language of the department , though French is still the only official language in France , according to the Constitution . The area is traditionally divided into comarques , of which five ( French Cerdagne , Capcir , Conflent , Roussillon and Vallespir ) are historically Catalan-speaking and one ( FenouillÃ des ) is historically Occitan-speaking . The five Catalan-speaking comarques were historically part of the Kingdom of Majorca .

The Singer Building or Singer Tower at Liberty Street and Broadway in Manhattan , was a 47-story office building completed in 1908 as the headquarters of the Singer Manufacturing Company . It was demolished in 1968 and is now the site of 1 Liberty Plaza . The building was commissioned by Frederick Bourne , the head of the Singer Sewing Machine Company . He hired noted architect Ernest Flagg , who was an early exponent of the Beaux-Arts architectural style . Flagg had also designed the company 's previous headquarters at 561 Broadway between Prince and Spring Streets -- in what is now the SoHo neighborhood -- which was referred to as the `` Little Singer Building '' after the new building was erected . Plans and working drawings were prepared by George W. Conable ( 1866-1933 ) . Flagg believed that buildings more than 10 or 15 stories high should be set back from the street , with the tower occupying only a quarter of the lot . The 12-story base of the building filled an entire blockfront , while the tower above was relatively narrow . The tower floors were squares only 65 feet ( 20 m ) on a side . The lobby had the quality of `` celestial radiance '' seen in world 's - fair and exposition architecture of the period , as the author Mardges Bacon described it in her 1986 monograph `` Ernest Flagg '' ( Architectural History Foundation , MIT Press ) . A forest of marble columns rose high to a series of multiple small domes of delicate plasterwork , and Flagg trimmed the columns with bronze beading . A series of large bronze medallions placed at the top of the columns were alternately rendered in the monogram of the Singer company and , quite inventively , as a huge needle , thread and bobbin . At 612 feet ( 187 m ) above grade , the Singer Building was the tallest building in the world from its completion until the completion in 1909 of the 700 f Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower at 23rd Street and Madison Avenue in Manhattan . Skyscraper zoning legislation , enacted in 1916 at Flagg 's urging , incorporated many of his ideas for setbacks in tall buildings . In 1961 , Singer sold the building and subsequently moved to Rockefeller Center . The building was then acquired by real estate developer William Zeckendorf , who sought unsuccessfully for the New York Stock Exchange to move there . United States Steel acquired the building in 1964 . By the 1960s the building was uneconomical because of its small interior dimensions . The tower portion of the building contained only 4200 s per floor , compared with 37000 s per floor of the building that replaced it , the U.S. Steel Building ( currently known as 1 Liberty Plaza ) . Although New York had a newly created Landmarks Preservation Commission by the time demolition commenced in 1967 , and the Singer Building was considered to be one of the most notable buildings in the city , it did not receive landmark designation that would have prevented demolition . Alan Burnham , executive director of the commission , said in August 1967 that if the building were to have been made a landmark , the city would have to either find a buyer for it or acquire it . Demolition commenced in August 1967 and was completed the following year . At the time , it was the tallest building ever to be destroyed . This record was surpassed in 2001 when the September 11 attacks caused the collapse of the nearby World Trade Center , but it is still the tallest building ever peacefully demolished . The earlier Singer Building in SoHo remains standing .

The Weser is a river in north-western Germany . Formed at Hann . MÃ 1\/4 nden by ( the confluence of ) the Fulda and Werra , it flows through Lower Saxony , then reaching the historic ( Hanseatic League ) port city of Bremen before emptying into the North Sea 50 km further north at Bremerhaven , which is also a seaport . On the opposite ( west ) bank is the town of Nordenham at the foot of the Butjadingen Peninsula ; thus , the mouth of the river is located in Lower Saxony . The Weser has an overall length of 452 km . Together with its Werra tributary , which originates in Thuringia , its length is 744 km . Linguistically , the name of both rivers , Weser and Werra , goes back to the same source , the differentiation being caused by the old linguistic border between Upper und Lower German , which touched the region of Hannoversch MÃ 1\/4 nden . The name Weser parallels the names of other rivers such as the Wear in England and the Vistula in Poland , all of which are ultimately derived from the root \* weis - `` to flow '' , which gave Old English\/Old Frisian wÄ se `` mud , ooze '' , Old Norse veisa `` slime , stagnant pool '' , Dutch waas `` lawn '' , Old Saxon waso `` wet ground , mire '' , and Old High German wasal `` rain '' . The Weser river is the longest German river to reach the sea the course of which lies entirely within the national territory . The top section of its course leads through a hilly region called the Weserbergland . It extends from the confluence of the Fulda and the Werra to the Porta Westfalica , where it runs through a gorge between two mountain chains , the Wiehengebirge in the west and the Weserbergland in the east . Between Minden and the North Sea , it has largely been canalised , permitting ships of up to 1,200 tons to navigate it . Eight hydroelectric dams are located along its length . It is linked to the Dortmund-Ems Canal via the Coastal Canal , and another canal links it at Bremerhaven to the Elbe River . A large reservoir on the Eder river , the main tributary of the Fulda , is used to regulate water levels on the Weser so as to ensure adequate depth for shipping throughout the year . The dam , built in 1914 , was bombed and destroyed by British aircraft in May 1943 , causing massive destruction and approximately 70 deaths downstream , but was rebuilt within four months . Today , the Edersee reservoir is a major summer resort area and provides substantial hydroelectricity . The Weser enters the North Sea in the southernmost part of the German Bight . In the North Sea it splits up into two arms representing the ancient riverbed at the end of the last ice age . These sea-arms are called Alte Weser ( old Weser ) and Neue Weser ( new Weser ) . They represent the major waterways for ships heading for the harbors of Bremerhaven , Nordenham and Bremen . The northernmost point of the Weser is marked by the Alte Weser lighthouse . This lighthouse replaced the historic and famous Roter Sand lighthouse in 1964 . The largest tributary of the Weser is the Aller , which joins south of Bremen . The tributaries of the Weser and the Werra ( from source to mouth ) are : Towns along the Weser , from the confluence of Werra and Fulda to the mouth , include : Hann . MÃ 1\/4 nden , Beverungen , HÃ xter , Holzminden , Bodenwerder , Hameln , Hessisch Oldendorf , Rinteln , Vlotho , Bad Oeynhausen , Porta Westfalica , Minden , Petershagen , Nienburg , Achim , Bremen , Brake , Nordenham , Bremerhaven .

Godwin 's law ( also known as Godwin 's Rule of Nazi Analogies or Godwin 's Law of Nazi Analogies ) is a humorous observation made by Mike Godwin in 1990 which has become an Internet adage . It states : `` As an online discussion grows longer , the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1 . '' In other words , Godwin put forth the hyperbolic observation that , given enough time , in any online discussion -- regardless of topic or scope -- someone inevitably criticizes some point made in the discussion by comparing it to beliefs held by Hitler and the Nazis . Godwin 's law is often cited in online discussions as a deterrent against the use of arguments in the widespread Reductio ad Hitlerum form . The rule does not make any statement about whether any particular reference or comparison to Adolf Hitler or the Nazis might be appropriate , but only asserts that the likelihood of such a reference or comparison arising increases as the discussion progresses . It is precisely because such a comparison or reference may sometimes be appropriate , Godwin has argued that overuse of Nazi and Hitler comparisons should be avoided , because it robs the valid comparisons of their impact . Although in one of its early forms Godwin 's law referred specifically to Usenet newsgroup discussions , the law is now often applied to any threaded online discussion , such as forums , chat rooms and blog comment threads , and has been invoked for the inappropriate use of Nazi analogies in articles or speeches . There are many corollaries to Godwin 's law , some considered more canonical ( by being adopted by Godwin himself ) than others . For example , there is a tradition in many newsgroups and other Internet discussion forums that once such a comparison is made , the thread is finished and whoever mentioned the Nazis has automatically `` lost '' whatever debate was in progress . This principle itself is frequently referred to as Godwin 's law . It is considered poor form to raise such a comparison arbitrarily with the motive of ending the thread . There is a widely recognized corollary that any such ulterior-motive invocation of Godwin 's law will be unsuccessful . Godwin 's law applies especially to inappropriate , inordinate , or hyperbolic comparisons of other situations ( or one 's opponent ) with Hitler or Nazis or their actions . The law and its corollaries would not apply to discussions covering genocide , propaganda , eugenics ( racial superiority ) or other mainstays of Nazi Germany , nor , more debatably , to discussion of other totalitarian regimes , since a Nazi comparison in those circumstances may be appropriate . Whether it applies to humorous use or references to oneself is open to interpretation , since this would not be a fallacious attack against a debate opponent . It is generally perceived that falling foul of Godwin 's law tends to end up causing the individual making the comparison to lose their argument and\/or credibility , as noted by a number of publications including in one article in The Daily Telegraph , however , Godwin 's law itself can be abused , as a distraction , diversion or even censorship , that fallaciously miscasts an opponent 's argument as hyperbole , especially if the comparisons made by the argument are actually appropriate . A 2005 Reason magazine article argued that Godwin 's law is often misused to ridicule even valid comparisons . Similar criticisms of the `` law '' ( or `` at least the distorted version which purports to prohibit all comparisons to German crimes '' ) have been made by Glenn Greenwald . Godwin has stated that he introduced Godwin 's law in 1990 as an experiment in memetics . Godwin 's law does not claim to articulate a fallacy ; it is instead framed as a memetic tool to reduce the incidence of inappropriate hyperbolic comparisons . `` Although deliberately framed as if it were a law of nature or of mathematics , its purpose has always been rhetorical and pedagogical : I wanted folks who glibly compared someone else to Hitler or to Nazis to think a bit harder about the Holocaust , '' Godwin has written .
He later played for Oita Trinita , Albirex Niigata and Vegalta Sendai in the J. League . Toshiaki Haji is a Japanese footballer .

The massing and design would allow for a built area roughly equal to the amount of the adjacent Sears Tower , which along with the winter garden would create a publicly accessible urban space , similar to the historic Rockefeller Plaza in NYC . 900 North Michigan in Chicago is a skyscraper completed in 1989 . At 871 feet ( 265 m ) tall , it is currently the seventh tallest building in Chicago and the 25th tallest in the United States . It was developed by Urban Retail Properties in 1988 as an upscale sister to Water Tower Place , one block southeast , and was the second vertical mall built along the Magnificent Mile . The building features a large , upscale shopping mall called 900 North Michigan Shops . Bloomingdale 's occupies the rear of its wide , six-story atrium , with other luxury shops and restaurants filling the remaining spaces . For this reason , it is commonly referred to as the `` Bloomingdale 's Building '' . The mall opened with Henri Bendel as a `` junior anchor '' , since replaced by men 's clothier Mark Shale . The layout of the retail area reflects lessons learned from Water Tower Place ; the anchor 's placement at the rear draws shoppers through the space and creates leasable space with valuable Michigan Avenue frontage , while the arrangement of escalators in parallel , rather than in zig-zags , directs foot traffic past more shops . Offices originally occupied floors 8-28 , but floors 21-28 were converted to condo units in 2007 , leaving offices on floors 8-20 . The luxurious Four Seasons Hotel occupies the middle floors ( 32-46 ) of the tower . Floors 48-66 are part of the 132 East Delaware Residences , these 106 condominiums were part of the original building plan . A large 12-story parking garage , with retail on the ground level and a medical clinic atop , occupies the rear half of the block , facing Rush Street . The exterior of the tower is clad in limestone and green glass which reflects the light . The building has a steel skeleton on which a concrete frame was erected for the upper floors . Because the building materials changed , cranes used to work on the lower floors could not be used for the concrete portion and new cranes had to be erected to complete the building . Four lit `` lanterns '' atop the structure give it a distinctive skyline presence .
Silent barter is a system whereby traders who can not speak each other 's language can trade without talking and to protect the secrets of where gold and salt came from . This system was used in many parts of ancient Africa . Silent bartering was mainly used during the period 500 to 1500 . To perform a silent barter , one group of traders would go to a specific location , leave their trading goods and then withdraw to a distance . Then play a drum to signal other traders that he was having a silent Barter . The other group of traders would then approach and inspect the goods ( most commonly salt or gold ) . If the goods met with approval , the second group would then take the goods , leave their own goods in return , and depart . This system of trading was used in particular in Ancient Ghana . It was also used among the Kushites and the Aksumites . ( see Aksum for details . ) It is described in detail in Robert A. Heinlein 's science fiction novel Citizen of the Galaxy , where the crew of a starship stops on a world whose nonhuman inhabitants practice a form of silent barter . The Greek historian Herodotus wrote about the gold trade with Ghana and Carthage : `` The Carthaginians also tell us that they trade with a race of men who live in a part of Libya beyond the Pillars of Hercules . ( Straits of Gibraltar ) On reaching this country , they unload their goods , arrange them tidily along the beach , and then , returning to their boats , raise a smoke . Seeing the smoke , the natives come down to the beach , place on the ground a certain quantity of gold in exchange for the goods , and go off again to a distance . The Carthaginians then come ashore and take a look at the gold ; and if they think it represents a fair price for their wares , they collect it and go away ; if , on the other hand , it seems too little , they go back aboard and wait , and the natives come and add to the gold until they are satisfied . There is perfect honesty on both sides ; the Carthaginians never touch the gold until it equals in value what they have offered for sale , and the natives never touch the goods until the gold has been taken away . '' 1 . The trader ( s ) might not be able to speak the other 's language . 2 . This was used to protect the secret of where the gold came from and where the salt came from .

The Lone Gunmen is a television show created by Chris Carter and broadcast on FOX . It was a spin-off of Carter 's popular long-running television series The X-Files and a part of The X-Files franchise , starring several of the show 's characters . The Lone Gunmen was first broadcast in March 2001 and , despite positive reviews , its ratings dropped . The program was canceled after thirteen episodes . The last episode was broadcast in June 2001 and ended on a cliffhanger which was partially resolved in a ninth-season episode of The X-Files entitled `` Jump the Shark '' . The series revolved around the three characters of The Lone Gunmen : Melvin Frohike , John Fitzgerald Byers and Richard Langly , a group of `` geeky '' investigators who ran a conspiracy theory magazine . They had often helped FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder on The X-Files . Unlike The X-Files , whose storylines dealt mainly with supernatural creatures and government alien conspiracies , episodes of The Lone Gunmen generally featured more `` plausible '' plots , such as government sponsored terrorism , the creeping government-induced police state surveillance society , cheating husbands , corporate crime , arms-dealers , and escaped Nazis . The show had a light atmosphere and focused heavily on physical comedy . The trio were often aided ( and sometimes hindered ) by a mysterious thief named Yves Adele Harlow ( Zuleikha Robinson ) . The plot of the first episode , which aired March 4 , 2001 , involves a US government conspiracy to hijack an airliner , fly it into the World Trade Center and blame it on terrorists , thereby gaining support for a new profit-making war . Parallels to the events of 9\/11 in this episode are noteworthy , if not uncanny , the episode being aired six months prior to 9\/11 . The series was filmed in Vancouver , Canada . Yves Adele Harlow is the alias for a fictional character who sometimes works with the Lone Gunmen ( though she 's sometimes at odds with them , as her goals are rarely as selfless as theirs ) and often employs various disguises . Her actual name is Lois Runtz , and she is the daughter of an arms dealer . Jimmy Bond is emotionally attached to her , although his feelings are for the most part unrequited . The alias is an anagram for Lee Harvey Oswald . She is played by British actress Zuleikha Robinson . David Duchovny ( Fox Mulder ) , Mitch Pileggi ( Walter Skinner ) and Michael McKean ( Morris Fletcher ) from The X-Files made guest appearances on the show . Fox Home Entertainment officially released the series ( along with the episode of The X-Files entitled `` Jump the Shark '' which finishes the cliffhanger that ended The Lone Gunmen as an additional episode ) on a three-disc Region 1 DVD set on Tuesday March 29 , 2005 . In the UK , it was released on January 31 , 2006 .

Claude Stanley Choules ( born 3 March 1901 ) is , at age 110 , one of the two living World War I veterans in the world , and is the last living military witness to the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow . He is also the last living veteran to have served in both world wars , and the last seaman from the first . Choules is also the only remaining male World War I veteran ( the last female veteran being Florence Green ) , and the last World War I veteran living in Australia . He is also the fourth oldest military veteran in the world and the oldest man known living in Australia . Choules became the oldest man born in the United Kingdom following the death of Stanley Lucas on 21 June 2010 . No documents to validate his age have yet been found or submitted . Born in Pershore , Worcestershire , and raised in nearby Wyre Piddle , son of Harry and Madeline ( nÃ e Winn ) , in April 1915 aged 14 Choules joined the Nautical Training Ship Mercury before transferring to the Royal Navy in October 1916 to serve aboard the Naval Training Ship HMS Circe situated at Plymouth . In 1917 , he joined the battleship HMS Revenge , which was the flagship of the First Battle Squadron . While serving aboard it , Choules witnessed the surrender of the German Imperial Navy at the Firth of Forth in 1918 , ten days after the Armistice , and also witnessed the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow . In 1926 , along with 11 other Royal Navy senior sailors , he came to Australia on loan as an instructor at Flinders Naval Depot . Choules decided to transfer permanently to the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) after sampling and agreeing with the Australian way of life . He took his discharge from the RAN in 1931 , but remained in the reserves and rejoined the RAN in 1932 as a CPO Torpedo and Anti Submarine Instructor . He 's never once returned to England since leaving . During World War II , Choules was the Acting Torpedo Officer of Fremantle . He was also the Chief Demolition Officer on the western side of the Australian continent . He was tasked with sabotaging Fremantle harbors and related oil storage tanks in the event of a Japanese invasion . Choules was also responsible for dealing with the first German mine to wash up on Australian soil during the war , near Esperance , West Australia . Choules remained in the RAN after World War II and transferred to the Naval Dockyard Police ( NDP ) to allow him to remain in service until 1956 , as retirement from the RAN for ratings in those days was at 50 years , while personnel could serve until 55 years old in the NDP . Choules and his wife Ethel were married for 80 years , until her death aged 98 . He has 3 children , 11 grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren . He currently lives at Gracewood Hostel in Salter Point , a suburb of Perth . Choules appeared in the BBC documentaries The Last Tommy ( 2005 ) and Harry Patch - The Last Tommy ( 2009 ) . Choules shuns celebrations of the Armistice , because he is against the glorification of war . In late April 2010 , Choules ' daughter Daphne Choules-Edinger reported that his health is declining and he is no longer able to give interviews . He is almost totally blind and deaf . He celebrated his 110th birthday in March 2011 . In 2009 , his autobiography The Last of the Last was published .

The Opel Zafira is a compact MPV engineered and produced by the German automaker Opel . The Zafira is branded as Vauxhall , and Chevrolet , depending on the market . In Japan , the Zafira was sold as Subaru Traviq . The car first appeared in 1999 , and a second generation model was introduced in 2005 . The Opel Zafira is produced in Bochum in Germany . The Opel Zafira has seven seats arranged in three rows , the back row of which can be folded into the floor to create more space , individually or together , rather than requiring that the extra seats be physically removed from the vehicle . The system was named Flex 7 . The first generation of Zafira is usually referred to as Zafira A , as is customary for Opel models . The car was based on the same platform as the 1998 Astra G\/B and shared much in common with that car . The Zafira A body was used in GM 's concept hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicle the HydroGen3 . The Opel Zafira A was replaced by Zafira B in Europe and Japan from 2005 , but is still sold in most other markets , except for Australia and New Zealand , where the model was canceled altogether . The Zafira was sold in the Philippines from 2001 to 2005 , being the last European-based Opel car to be sold in the Philippines after they stopped selling the Opel Astra in 2003 . The Opel Zafira comes with a variety of engines adopted from the Astra . For Europe , there was a CNG-powered version and a 200 hp turbocharged version by the Opel Performance Center . In Brazil , the Zafira is also available with a flexible fuel engine . The Zafira B debuted in Europe in 2004 , and sales started in 2005 . It also shares the platform and mechanicals with the Astra , this time the H\/C model . In February 2006 , Zafira B was launched in Singapore . By March 2006 , the model had only been introduced in Europe , Singapore and Japan , superseding the previous Zafira and the Subaru Traviq , respectively . In April in Mexico and later in September 2006 in Chile , this model was introduced , branded as Chevrolet Zafira . In Mexico the Opel Zafira was discontinued after the 2006 model year , and replaced by the 5-passenger Chevrolet HHR ( discontinued in Mexico since 2009 ) . It has so far been a huge sales success in the United Kingdom , proving even more popular than its predecessor . In 2006 it was the UK 's tenth best selling new car , proving more popular than the Vectra that just eight years earlier had been the brand 's best selling product . By 2010 , however , reflecting both its status as a run-out model and adverse consumer reaction to uncertainty over Opel 's future , the car was being outsold in the ratio of nearly 3:1 by the more recently face-lifted Volkswagen Touran on the German market , with 2,568 Zafiras sold in the first two months of the year against 7,270 Tourans . The Zafira B 's engine lineup is partly adopted from the previous Astra\/Zafira generation , but Opel replaced the old 2.0 and 2.2 turbodiesel I4 engines with 1.9 L common-rail turbodiesels developed by Fiat ( Multijet ) . Opel Performance Center developed a turbocharged 240 h 2.0 L performance version of the Zafira B as well . A CNG ( Compressed Natural Gas ) version of the new Zafira with a 1.6 L engine is also available . The third generation Zafira was previewed in concept form at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show , as the ` Zafira Tourer Concept ' . It has been revealed that , when the Zafira C goes on sale , the Zafira B will remain on sale , albeit in facelifted form , to act as a smaller and cheaper version , as the Zafira C is to increase in size to act as a proper rival to the Ford S-Max . The prodcution version is expected to debut at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show in September , and go on sale in early 2012 .
Manganese tetrafluoride , MnF4 , is the highest fluoride of manganese . It is a powerful oxidizing agent and is used as a means of purifying elemental fluorine . Manganese tetrafluoride was first unequivocally prepared in 1961 by the reaction of manganese ( II ) fluoride ( or other MnII compounds ) with a stream of fluorine gas at 550 Â C : the MnF4 sublimes into the gas stream and condenses onto a cold finger . This is still the commonest method of preparation , although the sublimation can be avoided by operating at increased fluorine pressure ( 4.5 â `` 6 bar at 180 â `` 320 Â C ) and mechanically agitating the powder to avoid sintering of the grains . The reaction can also be carried out starting from manganese powder in a fluidized bed . Other preparations of MnF4 include the fluorination of MnF2 with krypton difluoride , or with F2 in liquid hydrogen fluoride solution under ultraviolet light . Manganese tetrafluoride has also been prepared ( but not isolated ) in an acidâ `` base reaction between antimony pentafluoride and K2MnF6 as part of a chemical synthesis of elemental fluorine . MnF4 MnF3 + Â 1\/2 â F2 Decomposition is favored by increasing temperature , and disfavoured by the presence of fluorine gas , but the exact parameters of the equilibrium are unclear , with some sources saying that MnF4 will decompose slowly at room temperature , others placing a practical lower temperature limit of 70 Â C , and another claiming that MnF4 is essentially stable up to 320 Â C. The equilibrium pressure of fluorine above MnF4 at room temperature has been estimated at about 10 â ' 4 Pa ( 10 â ' 9 bar ) , and the enthalpy change of reaction at . Manganese tetrafluoride reacts violently with water and even with sodium-dried petroleum ether . It immediately decomposes on contact with moist air . Reaction with alkali metal fluorides or concentrated hydrofluoric acid gives the yellow hexafluoromanganate ( IV ) anion ( MnF6 ) 2 â ' . The main application of manganese tetrafluoride is in the purification of elemental fluorine . Fluorine gas is produced by electrolysis of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride ( with a small amount of potassium fluoride added as a support electrolyte ) in a Moissan cell . The technical product is contaminated with HF , much of which can be removed by passing the gas over solid KF , but also with oxygen ( from traces of water ) and possibly heavy-metal fluorides such as arsenic pentafluoride ( from contamination of the HF ) . These contaminants are particularly problematic for the semiconductor industry , which uses high-purity fluorine for etching silicon wafers . Further impurities , such as iron , nickel , gallium and tungsten compounds , can be introduced if unreacted fluorine is recycled . The technical-grade fluorine is purified by reacting it with MnF3 to form manganese tetrafluoride . As this stage , and heavy metals present will form involatile complex fluorides , while the HF and O2 are unreactive . Once the MnF3 has been converted , the excess gas is vented for recycling , carrying the remaining gaseous impurities with it . The MnF4 is then heated to 380 Â C to release fluorine at purities of up to 99.95 % , reforming MnF3 , which can be reused . By placing two reactors in parallel , the purification process can be made continuous , with one reactor taking in technical fluorine while the other delivers high-grade fluorine . Alternatively , the manganese tetrafluoride can be isolated and transported to where the fluorine is needed , at lower cost and greater safety than pressurized fluorine gas . The yellow hexafluoromanganate ( 2 â ' ) of alkali metal and alkaline earth metal cations have been known since 1899 , and can be prepared by the fluorination of MnF2 in the presence of the fluoride of the appropriate cation . They are much more stable than manganese tetrafluoride . Potassium hexafluoromanganate ( IV ) , K2MnF6 , can also be prepared by the controlled reduction of potassium permanganate in 50 % aqueous hydrofluoric acid . 2 â KMnO4 + 2 â KF + 10 â HF + 3 â H2O2 2 â K2MnF6 + 8 â H2O + 3 â O2 The pentafluoromanganate ( 1 â ' ) salts of potassium , rubidium and caesium , MMnF5 , can be prepared by fluorination of MMnF3 or by the reaction of ( MnF4 ( py ) ( H2O ) ) with MF . The lemon-yellow heptafluoromanganate ( 3 â ' ) salts of the same metals , M3MnF7 , have also been prepared .

Otherkin are a community of people who identify themselves as non-human in all but outward form , contending that they are creatures traditionally associated with myth or legend . The therian , vampire , and draconic subcultures are related to the otherkin community somewhat , and are considered part of it by most otherkin , but are culturally distinct movements of their own despite some overlap in membership . Some may claim to be able to shift mentally â '' meaning that they may experience the sense of being in their particular form while not actually changing physically . The existence of Otherkin is variably explained as being made possible through reincarnation , having a nonhuman soul , ancestry , or symbolic metaphor . Common creatures otherkin identify as include angels , demons , dragons , elves , extra-terrestrials , fairies , kitsune , vampires , and various terrestrial animals . The oldest Internet resource for otherkin is the Elfinkind Digest ; a mailing list started in 1990 by a student at the University of Kentucky for `` elves and interested observers '' . Also in the early 1990s , newsgroups such as alt . horror . werewolves and alt . fan . dragons on Usenet , which were initially created for fans of these creatures in the context of fantasy and horror literature and films , also developed followings of individuals who identified as mythological beings . On 6 February 1995 , a document titled the `` Elven Nation Manifesto '' was posted to Usenet , including the groups alt . pagan and alt . magick . On Usenet itself , the document was universally panned and considered to be either a troll or an attempt to frame an innocent party . However , enough people contacted the original author of the Elven Nation post in good faith for a mailing list to spin off from it . The modern otherkin subculture grew out of these elven online communities of the early-to-mid-1990s , with the earliest recorded use of the term otherkin appearing in July of 1990 and the variant otherkind being reported as early as April 1990 .

Paranasal sinuses are air-filled spaces , communicating with the nasal cavity , within the bones of the skull and face . The paranasal air sinuses are lined with respiratory epithelium ( ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium ) . Paranasal sinuses form developmentally through excavation of bone by air-filled sacs ( pneumatic diverticula ) from the nasal cavity . This process begins prenatally , and it continues through the course of an organism 's lifetime . Paranasal sinuses occur in a variety of animals ( including most mammals , birds , non-avian dinosaurs , and crocodilians ) . In non-humans , the bones occupied by sinuses are quite variable . The paranasal sinuses are joined to the nasal cavity via small orifices called ostia . These become blocked easily by allergic inflammation , or by swelling in the nasal lining which occurs with a cold . If this happens , normal drainage of mucus within the sinuses is disrupted , and sinusitis may occur . These conditions may be treated with drugs such as pseudoephedrine , which causes vasoconstriction in the sinuses , reducing inflammation , by traditional techniques of nasal irrigation , or by corticosteroid . Malignancies of the paranasal sinuses comprise approximately 0.2 % of all malignancies . About 80 % of these malignancies arise in the maxillary sinus . Men are much more often affected than women . They most often occur in the age group between 40 and 70 years . Carcinomas are more frequent than sarcomas . Metastases are rare . Tumours of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses are extremely rare . Sinus is a Latin word meaning a fold or pocket ; in particular the front pocket in a toga .

He is a draft pick of the Bruins , selected second overall in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft . Seguin signed an entry level contract with the Bruins on August 3 , 2010 . Seguin played part of his minor hockey career with the Whitby Wildcats of the OMHA before relocating to Brampton , Ontario . While , in Brampton , he played up a year , playing for the Minor Midget Toronto Young Nationals in his Bantam year , and then again in his Minor Midget year coached by Rick Vaive , before moving on to the OHL . Seguin was selected 9th overall in the 2008 OHL Priority Selection Draft by the Plymouth Whalers . He considered playing for a National Collegiate Athletic Association school like his father Paul did , but chose to forego his American college eligibility by joining the Whalers in 2008 â `` 09 . He struggled to begin his OHL career , scoring one goal in his first 17 games before a coaching change in Plymouth helped Seguin find his place in the league . After new coach Mike Vellucci moved Seguin to the top line , the 17-year-old forward broke out offensively , scoring 58 points in his final 41 games and helped Plymouth reach the second round of the OHL playoffs . Looking for an improved start to his 2009 â `` 10 OHL season , Seguin spent his summer working on his game . His dedication paid off , as he opened the season with 36 points in 18 games until sidelined by a hip pointer . His early season success led NHL Central Scouting to name him the top prospect for the 2010 Entry Draft in its November rankings . He then slipped to second , behind Taylor Hall , who was selected first overall by the Edmonton Oilers . Seguin was drafted 2nd overall by the Boston Bruins , due to an earlier trade between Boston and Toronto . He captained Team Orr at the 2010 CHL Top Prospects Game , .

The assists went to Ryder and Tim Thomas . At the beginning of December 2010 , another comparison was made between Seguin 's emerging style of play with the Bruins , and the rookie year of the Tampa Bay Lightning 's star forward Steven Stamkos , who was the leading goal scorer in the NHL at the time , in how it was developing . Seguin competed for Canada at the 2009 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament in the Czech Republic , where he led the team in scoring with ten points in four games as Canada won the gold medal . He attended Hockey Canada 's selection camp for the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in December 2009 , but did not make the team .

George Leake CMG ( posthumous ) QC ( 3 December 1856 -- 24 June 1902 ) was Premier of Western Australia from 27 May 1901 to 21 November 1901 , and again from 23 December 1901 until his death on 24 June 1902 . George Leake was born on 3 December 1856 in Perth in what was then the British colony of Western Australia . He was educated at the Church of England Collegiate School ( now Hale School ) and at St Peter 's College in Adelaide . He studied law , and in 1880 was admitted to the Western Australian bar and became a partner in his father 's law firm . The following year he married Louisa Emily Burt , daughter of the late Chief Justice ; Sir Archibald Burt . In 1883 he was appointed Crown Solicitor and Public Prosecutor . Leake also took a keen interest in the gold mining industry , and was a member of the syndicate that successfully sent Harry Anstey to find gold in the Yilgarn in 1887 . In September 1886 , Leake was appointed acting Attorney-General , and was subsequently nominated to the colony 's Legislative Council . He remained in the position until December . On 28 November 1890 , Leake was elected unopposed to the Legislative Assembly seat of Roebourne . He was offered a position in John Forrest 's ministry , but declined , and resigned shortly afterwards on 30 December 1890 to avoid forfeiting his position as Crown Solicitor . On 23 June 1894 , Leake was elected as Legislative Assembly member for Albany , and in the following year became Leader of the Opposition . He was an enthusiastic proponent of federation and was president of the Federation League . In 1897 he was chosen as a Western Australian delegate to the Federal Convention , and attended meetings in Adelaide , Sydney and Melbourne . He became a Queen 's Counsel in 1898 . On 2 August 1900 Leake resigned his seat for business reasons , and traveled to Europe . After his return , he was elected to the Legislative Assembly as member for West Perth on 24 April 1901 . No party won clear support in that election , and the incumbent premier George Throssell resigned office before parliament met , rather than test his support . Leader of the Opposition Frederick Illingworth was then invited to form a government , but could not do so because Leake refused to serve under him and some other members refused to serve without Leake . Eventually it was agreed that Leake would become premier , and Illingworth would be treasurer and colonial secretary . Leake became Premier and Attorney-General on 27 May . Leake 's government did not have the support of the majority of parliament , but it was allowed to govern for five months until finally being defeated in November . Alf Morgans then formed a government , but in the subsequent ministerial by-election , supporters of Leake stood against Morgans ' new cabinet , and three of the six new ministers were defeated . Morgans then resigned and Leake returned as Premier and Attorney-General on 23 December 1901 , this time with much clearer support . In June 1902 , Leake caught pneumonia . He died on 24 June 1902 , to date the only Western Australian premier to die in office . Two days later it was announced in The Times that King Edward VII had intended to make him a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George ( CMG ) , and the award was made posthumously .

The Nunc dimittis ( also Song of Simeon or Canticle of Simeon ) is a canticle from a text in the second chapter of Luke ( Luke 2:29 â `` 32 ) named after its first words in Latin . Simeon was a devout Jew who , according to the book of Luke , had been promised by the Holy Ghost that he would not die until he had seen the Saviour . When Mary and Joseph brought the baby Jesus to the Temple in Jerusalem for the ceremony of consecration of the firstborn son ( not the circumcision , but rather after the time of Mary 's purification : at least 40 days after the birth ) , Simeon was there , and he took Jesus into his arms and uttered words rendered variously as follows . Lumen ad revelationem gentium , et gloriam plebis tuae Israel . A light to the revelation of the Gentiles , and the glory of Thy people Israel . Lord , now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace : according to thy word . For mine eyes have seen : thy salvation , Which thou hast prepared : before the face of all people ; To be a light to lighten the Gentiles : and to be the glory of thy people Israel . English ( The Divine Office ( Grail Version ) , 1974 ) At last , all-powerful Master , + you give leave to your servant \* to go in peace , according to your promise . For my eyes have seen your salvation \* which you have prepared for all nations , the light to enlighten the Gentiles \* and give glory to Israel , your people . English ( Liturgy of the Hours , 1975 ) Lord , now you let your servant go in peace ; Your word has been fulfilled . My eyes have seen the salvation You have prepared in the sight of every people , A light to reveal you to the nations and the glory of your people , Israel . Master , now you are dismissing your servant in peace , according to your word ; for my eyes have seen your salvation , which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples , a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel . The Nunc Dimittis is the traditional ` Gospel Canticle ' of Night Prayer ( Compline ) , just as Benedictus and Magnificat are the traditional Gospel Canticles of Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer respectively . Hence the Nunc Dimittis is found in the liturgical night office of many western denominations , including Evening Prayer ( or Evensong ) in the Anglican Book of Common Prayer of 1662 , Compline ( A Late Evening Service ) in the Anglican Book of Common Prayer of 1928 , and the Night Prayer service in the Anglican Common Worship , as well as both the Roman Catholic and Lutheran service of Compline . In eastern tradition the canticle is found in Eastern Orthodox Vespers . One of the most well-known settings in England is a plainchant theme of Thomas Tallis . Among Lutheran churches , the Nunc Dimittis may be sung following the reception of the Eucharist . Many composers have set the text to music , usually coupled with the Magnificat , as both the Magnificat and the Nunc dimittis are sung ( or said ) during the Anglican service of Evening Prayer according to the Book of Common Prayer , 1662 , in which the older offices of Vespers ( Evening Prayer ) and Compline ( Night Prayer ) were deliberately merged into one service , with both Gospel Canticles employed .

Michigan Law has also placed 30 of its graduates on the state 's Supreme Court , including five who served as Chief Justice . Michigan Law School consistently ranks among the highest-rated law schools in the United States . It was ranked third in the initial U.S. News & World Report law school rankings in 1987 , only below Yale and Harvard , and is one of seven schools never to appear outside the magazine 's top 10 . Michigan Law is also one of the `` T14 '' law schools , that is , schools that have consistently ranked within the top 14 law schools since U.S. News began publishing rankings . In the 2011 U.S. News ranking , Michigan Law is ranked 7th overall . Other 2009 rankings place Michigan as high as second . Michigan Law is currently ranked 6th for International Law .

In 1870 , Gabriel Franklin Hargo graduated from Michigan as the second African-American to graduate from law school in the United States . In 1871 Sarah Killgore , a Michigan Law graduate , became the first woman to both graduate from law school and be admitted to the bar . Although the law school is part of the public University of Michigan , only three percent of the law school 's expenses are covered by state funds . The remainder ( 97-98 % of Michigan Law 's budget ) is supplied by private gifts , tuition , and endowments . As of 2009 , Michigan Law is engaging in a $ 102 million dollar enterprise , constructing an addition to the law building that remains loyal to the English Gothic style . This enterprise is fully funded by endowments and private gifts . 2009 also marked the school 's sesquicentennial celebration . As a part of the festivities , Chief Justice John Roberts visited the school and participated in the groundbreaking ceremony for the new building . The Law Quadrangle is designed in the English Gothic style . Michigan Law School students publish six well-regarded law journals including the Michigan Law Review , the sixth oldest legal journal in the U.S. Students may compete in intramural and extramural moot court competitions , the oldest of which is the prestigious Henry M. Campbell Moot Court Competition , established in 1926 . Student Funded Fellowships ( SFF ) is a program designed to fund Michigan Law students who accept public interest summer jobs with low pay . SFF is governed by a board of 9-12 law students and operates independently of the Law School . The Board elects its own members , including two co-chairs , a treasurer , and various committee chairs . Board members head fundraising efforts throughout the year , ranging from Donate a Day 's Pay ( DADP ) , in which highly paid law firm clerks donate a day 's salary to SFF , to a grand auction in March that invites bids on various donated items , including sports tickets , meals with faculty members , and art . In the late spring , Board members review applications for summer funding and select a limited number of highly qualified students for grants . In 2007 about twice as many students applied for grants as could be funded .

Ciego de Ã vila is one of the provinces of Cuba , and was previously part of CamagÃ 1\/4 ey Province . Its capital is Ciego de Ã vila , which lies on the Carretera Central ( central highway ) , and the second city is MorÃ n , further north . The province was separated from CamagÃ 1\/4 ey Province in 1975 by the government . Off the north coast of the province , some ( cays ) of the Jardines del Rey archipelago are being developed as tourist resorts , principally Cayo Coco and Cayo Guillermo . The south coast is characterised by mangroves . Between MorÃ n and the north coast are several lakes , including the Laguna de Leche ( the Lagoon of Milk , so called for its white appearance because of large lime deposits underwater ) which is the largest natural lake in Cuba . Central Ciego de Ã vila is used for cattle ranching , elsewhere in the province sugar , pineapples and citrus fruit are grown . Pineapples are the staple crop , but sweet potatoes , potatoes , yuca , plantains , and bananas are also cultivated for national consumption . Source : Population from 2004 Census . Area from 1976 municipal re-distribution . In 2004 , the province of Ciego de Ã vila had a population of 416,370 . With a total area of , the province had a population density of .
Aldo Serena ( born in Montebelluna on 25 June 1960 ) is an Italian former footballer . He played for the Azzurri in the 1986 FIFA World Cup and the 1990 FIFA World Cup . In total he earned 24 caps and scored 5 goals for Italy . In Italia '90 Serena scored on his 30th birthday in Italy 's 2-0 win over Uruguay but left the pitch in tears after he missed a crucial spot kick in the semi-final against Argentina , a game the home nation lost on penalties . Serena has always stated that he did not want to take a penalty in the shootout . However , as no-one else volunteered , Italian manager Azeglio Vicini had no choice but to include Serena as the final penalty kick taker . During his career , Serena played for Montebelluna , Inter , Como , Bari , AC Milan , Juventus and Torino . He enjoyed his best with Inter Milan , in 1988 â `` 89 , when he won the Scudetto and was crowned top scorer of the league , scoring 22 goals . After his move to Milan his reputation as an Inter legend was somewhat tarnished . This was shown recently when Serena 's name was booed by some of Inter 's Ultras supporters when announced he was to be part of an Inter Legends gathering after the final game of the 2006 â `` 07 league trophy presentation . Serena also played for Italy at the 1984 Summer Olympics .

The village maintains a full time police and fire rescue department . The Ottawa Hills school district ranked first in the state in student performance for the 2007-2008 school year . The village is ranked 13 out of 1065 political subdivisions in the state of Ohio by per capita income . Ottawa Hills is located at ( 41.669750 , -83.640068 ) . The village has a total area of 1.9 square miles ( 3.0 kmÂ ) . 1.9 square miles ( 3.0 kmÂ ) of it is land and 0.53 % is water . As of the census of 2000 , there were 4,564 people , 1,696 households , and 1,307 families residing in the village . The population density was 2,448.6 people per square mile ( 947.4 \/ kmÂ ) . There were 1,786 housing units at an average density of 958.2 \/ sq mi ( 370.7 \/ kmÂ ) . The racial makeup of the village was 93.97 % White , 1.25 % African American , 0.09 % Native American , 2.70 % Asian , 0.46 % from other races , and 1.53 % from two or more races . 1.23 % of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race . There were 1,696 households out of which 38.7 % had children under the age of 18 living with them , 70.0 % were married couples living together , 5.1 % had a female householder with no husband present , and 22.9 % were non-families . 20.9 % of all households were made up of individuals and 13.3 % had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older . The average household size was 2.69 and the average family size was 3.15 . In the village the population was spread out with 30.1 % under the age of 18 , 4.1 % from 18 to 24 , 19.7 % from 25 to 44 , 29.9 % from 45 to 64 , and 16.2 % who were 65 years of age or older . The median age was 43 years . For every 100 females there were 94.0 males . For every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 89.2 males . The median income for a household in the village was $ 100,000 , and the median income for a family was $ 117,130 . Males had a median income of $ 84,029 versus $ 40,801 for females . The per capita income for the village was $ 58,846 . 2.1 % of the population and 1.4 % of families were below the poverty line . 3.2 % of those under the age of 18 and 0.8 % of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line . The Village of Ottawa Hills can trace its origins back to 1915 . John North Willys , president of the Overland Company , acquired approximately 1,200 acres ( 4.6 kmÂ ) beginning at the intersection of Bancroft Street and Indian Road and extending along the Ottawa River to Central Avenue . Landscape architects , city planning engineers , landscape gardeners , and other experts , backed by an army of workmen equipment with the latest machinery and tools have been steadily at work on the tract for over a year . They have practically completed the improvement of the first 100 a unit of the development , lying at Arrowhead Point ( former known as 5 Point ) . This is at the intersection of Bancroft Street , Secor and Indian Roads , a 20 minute ride from the business district . A cursory inspection of the property reveals the scale on which the improvements are being made . Practically 35 % of it has been given over to park purposes . This includes the wooded area along the river 's course , flanked on one side by Percifilous Bluff and the other side by a slope that rises , by gentle degrees , to a level with the top of the bluff . In the valley , river banks have been dressed gracefully to the water 's edge . John North Willys turned to the E. H. Close Realty Company for the actual development of Ottawa Hills . The E. H. Close Realty Company had developed more than 1,000 acres ( 4 kmÂ ) of land in Toledo and the surrounding area . Planners , engineers , and architects with national reputations were involved in the layout and design of the Village . They were also involved with the creation of various restrictive covenants to assure proper quality development and construction of homes . Several annexations have substantially changed the shape of the Village from the original 1,200 acres ( 4.6 kmÂ ) . However , much of the early development of the Village is very consistent with the original plans that date back to 1915 . The portion of the Village adjacent to Secor Road and south of Bancroft Street , Plat 1 , is very similar in layout and design to the original plans . Many of the oldest homes in the Village are located in Plat 1 . E. H. Close lived in this plat in one of the first homes built in the Village . The median price of a house in Ottawa Hills is approximately $ 250,000 .
Akira Kaji ( born January 13 , 1980 in Minamiawaji , HyÅ go ) is a Japanese professional football player . He is a specialist on the right-hand side of the pitch playing as a full back or a wide midfielder . He currently plays for J. League side Gamba Osaka . After graduating from Takigawa Daini High School , Kaji joined Cerezo Osaka in 1998 . He made his first league appearance on July 25 , 1998 against Avispa Fukuoka . At the club , he found it difficult to break into the first team and was loaned out to J. League Division 2 side Oita Trinita at the start of the 2000 season . After spending 2 years at Oita , Kaji came back to Division 1 in 2002 to play for F.C. Tokyo . The manager Hiromi Hara made him a regular and assigned a more attacking role . His club won the 2004 J. League Cup by beating Urawa Red Diamonds in the final which ended 0-0 after the extra time . The penalty shoot-out was required and his successful conversion as the last penalty taker for Tokyo finally broke the deadlock . He was transferred to Gamba Osaka at the beginning of the 2006 season and scored in the beginning league match against Urawa Reds . He was selected as a member of the 2006 J-League Team of the Year . He was a member of the Japan team for the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship finals where the team finished runners-up . He gained his first cap for Japan when national coach Zico played him on October 8 , 2003 in a friendly against Tunisia . He was rated highly by Zico who made him the first-choice right full-back . He was a member of the Japan team who won the 2004 Asian Cup in China . In a 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup against Brazil , his goal was disallowed by a controversial offside decision . His first goal for the country finally came on August 17 , 2005 in a World Cup qualifier against Iran . He made the final squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals . In a preparation match against Germany just before the tournament , he injured his ankle when tackled by Bastian Schweinsteiger . Zico considered his replacement but decided to keep him . He missed Japan 's first game in the tournament against Australia with YÅ `` ichi Komano filling in for his place , but he returned to the team and played in the rest of the competition . After the 2006 World Cup , Zico was replaced by Ivica Osim who also regularly picks him for the national team . He was a member of the Japan team for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup and played all the Japan games in the tournament . On May 20 , 2008 he announced retirement from international football .
The leek , Allium ampeloprasum var . porrum ( L. ) , also sometimes known as Allium porrum , is a vegetable which belongs , along with the onion and garlic , to the Alliaceae family . Two related vegetables , the elephant garlic and kurrat , are also variant subspecies of Allium ampeloprasum , although different in their uses as food . The edible part of the leek plant is a bundle of leaf sheaths which is sometimes called a stem or stalk . Rather than forming a tight bulb like the onion , the leek produces a long cylinder of bundled leaf sheaths which are generally blanched by pushing soil around them ( trenching ) . They are often sold as small seedlings in flats which are started off early in greenhouses , to be planted out as weather permits . Once established in the garden , leeks are hardy ; many varieties can be left in the ground during the winter to be harvested as needed . Leek cultivars can be subdivided in several ways , but the most common types are â summer leeksâ , intended for harvest in the season when planted , and overwintering leeks , meant to be harvested in the spring of the year following planting . Summer leek types are generally smaller than overwintering types ; overwintering types are generally more strongly flavored . Varieties include King Richard and Tadorna Blue . Leeks are easy to grow from seed and tolerate standing in the field for an extended harvest . Leeks usually reach maturity in the autumn months , and they have few pest or disease problems . Leeks can be bunched and harvested early when they are about the size of a finger or pencil , or they can be thinned and allowed to grow to a much larger mature size . Hilling leeks can produce better specimens . The edible portions of the leek are the white onion base and light green stalk . The dark green portion is usually discarded since it has less flavor . As the leek grows , this part becomes woody and very chewy . One of the most popular uses for the whites and light green stalks is for adding flavor to stock . Chefs rarely use the darker part of the leek for stock because of its bitterness . However , a few leaves are sometimes tied with twine and other herbs to form a bouquet garni . Leek has a mild onion-like taste , less bitter than scallion . The taste might be described as a mixture of mild onion and cucumber , with a fresh smell similar to scallion . In its raw state , the vegetable is crunchy and firm . Leek is typically chopped into slices 5 â `` 10 mm thick . The slices have a tendency to fall apart , due to the layered structure of the leek . There are different ways of preparing the vegetable : Leeks are an ingredient of cock-a-leekie soup , leek and potato soup and vichyssoise , along with leek soup . Because of their symbolism in Wales ( see below ) , they have come to be used extensively in that countryâ s cuisine . Elsewhere in Britain , leeks have come back into favor only in the last fifty years or so , having been overlooked for several centuries . Dried specimens from archaeological sites in ancient Egypt , as well as wall carvings and drawings , led Zohary and Hopf to conclude that the leek was a part of the Egyptian diet â from at least the 2nd millennium BCE onwards . â They also allude to surviving texts that show it had been also grown in Mesopotamia from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE . The leek was the favorite vegetable of the Emperor Nero , who consumed it in soup or in oil , believing it beneficial to the quality of his voice . The leek is one of the national emblems of Wales , worn along with the daffodil ( in Welsh , the daffodil is known as `` Peter 's Leek , '' Cenhinen Bedr ) on St. Davidâ s Day . According to one legend , King Cadwaladr of Gwynedd ordered his soldiers to identify themselves by wearing the vegetable on their helmets in an ancient battle against the Saxons that took place in a leek field . This story may have been made up by the English poet Michael Drayton , but it is known that the leek has been a symbol of Wales for a long time ; Shakespeare , for example , refers to the custom of wearing a leek as an â ancient traditionâ in Henry V. In the play , Henry tells Fluellen that he is wearing a leek â for I am Welsh , you know , good countryman . â The 1985 and 1990 British one pound coins bear the design of a leek in a coronet , representing Wales . Perhaps the most visible use of the leek , however , is as the cap badge of the Welsh Guards , a regiment within the Household Division of the British Army . In Romania , the leek is also widely considered a symbol of Oltenia , a historical region in the south-western part of the country .
Nicktoons are animated television shows which are produced by and aired on the children 's television channel Nickelodeon . Prior to 1991 , Nickelodeon aired mostly foreign made animated series . The idea for Nicktoons was formed in 1989 and on Sunday , August 11 , 1991 , the first Nicktoon , Doug , was aired followed by Rugrats and The Ren and Stimpy Show . This format was repeated every Sunday .
AsniÃ res-sur-Seine is a commune in the northwestern suburbs of Paris , France . It is located 7.9 k from the center of Paris . It is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Europe . AsniÃ res-sur-Seine was originally called simply AsniÃ res . The name AsniÃ res was recorded for the first time in a papal bull of 1158 as Asnerias , from Medieval Latin asinaria , meaning `` donkey farm '' . The poor soil of AsniÃ res , where heather grew in Medieval times , was probably deemed only suitable for the breeding of donkeys . On 15 February 1968 the name of the commune became officially AsniÃ res-sur-Seine ( meaning `` AsniÃ res upon Seine '' ) , in order to distinguish it from other communes of France also called AsniÃ res . It is also served by AsniÃ res-sur-Seine station on the Transilien Paris -- Saint-Lazare suburban rail line . The Post-impressionist painting by Georges-Pierre Seurat Bathers at AsniÃ res depicts a scene of 19th century leisure and developing industry in this suburb of Paris . The CimetiÃ re des Chiens is believed to be the first zoological necropolis in the world . AsniÃ res is the birthplace of Henri Barbusse , 1873 , writer of Under Fire . Tottenham Hotspur defender William Gallas was born in this suburb of Paris .
Transport for London ( TfL ) is the local government body responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London in England . Its role is to implement the transport strategy and to manage transport services across London . Its head office is in the Windsor House in the City of Westminster . TfL is controlled by a board whose members are appointed by the Mayor of London , a position currently held by Boris Johnson , who also chairs the Board . The Commissioner of Transport for London ( Peter Hendy since 17 January 2006 ) reports to the Board and leads a management team with individual functional responsibilities . TfL was created in 2000 as part of the Greater London Authority by the Greater London Authority Act 1999 . It gained most of its functions from its predecessor London Regional Transport in 2000 . It did not take over responsibility for the London Underground until 2003 , after the controversial Public-private partnership ( PPP ) contract for maintenance had been agreed . Management of the Public Carriage Office had previously been a function of the Metropolitan Police . Transport for London Group Archives holds business records for TfL and its predecessor bodies and transport companies . Some early records are also held on behalf of TfL Group Archives at the London Metropolitan Archives . TfL is organised in three main directorates and corporate services , each with responsibility for different aspects and modes of transport . The three main directorates are : Each of the main units has its own corporate identity , formed by differently-coloured versions of the standard roundel logo and adding appropriate lettering across the horizontal bar . The roundel rendered in blue without any lettering represents TfL as a whole ( see Transport for London logo ) , as well as used in situations where lettering on the roundel is not possible ( such as bus receipts , where a logo is a blank roundel with the name `` London Buses '' to the right ) . The same range of colors is also used extensively in publicity and on the TfL website . Most of the transport modes that come under the control of TfL have their own charging and ticketing regimes for single fare . Buses and trams share a common fare and ticketing regime , and the DLR and the Underground another . Superimposed on these mode-specific regimes is the Travelcard system , which provides zonal tickets with validities from one day to one year , and off-peak variants . These are accepted on the DLR , buses , railways , trams , the Underground and provides a discount on many river services fares . The Oyster card is a contactless smart card system introduced for the public in 2003 , which can be used to pay individual fares ( pay as you go ) or to carry various Travelcards and other passes . It is used by holding the card close to the yellow card reader . Card readers are found on ticket gates where otherwise a paper ticket could be fed through , allowing the gate to open and the passenger to walk through , and on stand-alone Oyster validators , which do not operate a barrier . From 2010 Oyster Pay as you go can be used on all National Rail services within London . Oyster Pay As You Go has a set of daily maximum charges that are the same as buying the nearest equivalent Day Travelcard . TfL has developed an electronic `` Journey Planner '' , which enables users to plan journeys by all forms of public transport and bicycle in and around London . On 1 June 2008 , the drinking of alcoholic beverages was banned on Tube and London Overground trains , buses , trams , Docklands Light Railway and all stations across London . Carrying open containers of alcohol was also banned on public transport . The Mayor of London and TfL announced the ban with the intention of providing a safer and more pleasant experience for passengers . There were `` Last Round on the Underground '' parties on the night before the ban came into force . Until bylaws are altered to incorporate the ban the only enforcement action available is confiscation of the alcohol and\/or ejection from the London Transport network . After the bombings on the underground and bus systems on 7 July 2005 , many staff were recognized in the 2006 New Year honors list for the work they did . They helped survivors out , removed bodies , and got the transport system up and running , to get the millions of commuters back out of London at the end of the work day . Those mentioned include Peter Hendy , who was at the time Head of Surface Transport division , and Tim O'Toole , head of the Underground division , who were both awarded CBEs . TfL owns and operates the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden , a museum that conserves and explains London 's transport heritage . The museum also has an extensive depot , situated at Acton , that contains material impossible to display at the central London museum , including many additional road vehicles , trains , collections of signs and advertising materials . The depot has several open weekends each year . There are also occasional heritage train runs on the Metropolitan Line .
The 1972 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 , 1972 , and lasted until November 30 , 1972 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin . A strong El NiÃ o kept hurricane activity at a minimum , and in fact the season was one of the quietest since the beginning of regular hurricane reconnaissance in 1944 . It was also one of only four hurricane seasons since 1944 to have no major hurricanes ( the other years being the 1968 season , the 1986 season , and the 1994 season ) . Although a very inactive season , 1972 brought one of the deadliest and most expensive hurricanes to strike the United States , Hurricane Agnes . Agnes was a weak but large storm that made landfall at the Florida panhandle and then followed the east coast northward . It killed 122 and caused $ 2.1 billion ( 1972 dollars ) in damage , mostly due to flooding in Pennsylvania and New York . Subtropical Storm Alpha developed from a cold-core ( extratropical ) low in late May off the Florida coast . As the low moved northeastward , it warmed a little , and became Subtropical Depression One . It turned sharply southward on May 26 due to a building ridge of high pressure . The same day it became Subtropical Storm Alpha , and it moved toward the Georgia coast . After reaching its peak of 70 m , Alpha weakened , but managed to hit near Brunswick , Georgia as a 45 m subtropical storm . Alpha dissipated over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on May 29 . Alpha was the first named subtropical storm . Hurricane Agnes was a large June Gulf of Mexico hurricane that formed over the YucatÃ n Peninsula on June 14 . It moved northward , reaching and maintaining hurricane intensity prior to landfall on the Florida Panhandle . Agnes reintensified over North Carolina , and in combination with an extratropical low to its west , brought very heavy rains to the Mid-Atlantic . Agnes dissipated on June 23 after causing over $ 3 billion in damage ( 1970 US dollars ) . It held the record for most expensive hurricane in American history until Hurricane Frederic surpassed it in 1979 . The precursor of Hurricane Betty was a subtropical depression that developed from a decaying cold front on August 22 , located 200 m north-northeast of Bermuda . Initially a small cyclone , only 30 â `` 40 miles in diameter , the depression grew as it strengthened and moved eastward , becoming Subtropical Storm Bravo on August 24 . On August 25 , the broad wind field became more compact , and it was named Tropical Storm Betty . On August 27 it became a hurricane , and on August 28 Betty reached its peak of 100 mph ( Category 2 intensity ) , the highest winds of the 1972 season . Building high pressure to its east forced Betty to the southwest , and over the next 3 days it executed a loop , but cooler waters and upper level shear turned the system extratropical on September 1 . A complex system combining a tropical wave and an upper level low led to the formation of a tropical depression east of Florida on August 29 . It managed to become a tropical storm on August 31 and reached its initial peak later that day , but upper level winds ripped the system apart , leaving behind a weak tropical storm with 40 m winds . Carrie found its second wind as a trough in the westerlies brought it northward . Due to baroclinic processes , Carrie reached its peak of 70 m just prior to becoming extratropical on September 3 . As Carrie passed Cape Cod , it caused $ 1.15 million in damage throughout Massachusetts and New England . A tropical wave , combined with an upper trophospheric trough , caused an area of convection to become a tropical depression on September 5 , near the southeast coast of Florida . Though conditions were unfavorable , the depression managed to become Tropical Storm Dawn on September 6 and a hurricane on September 7 . The development of a cold-core low near Cape Hatteras forced Dawn westward , then southeastward , where Dawn became a 50 m tropical storm . It continued to weaken as it approached the Georgia and South Carolina coasts , and it finally dissipated on September 14 , causing little damage over land . Subtropical Storm Charlie formed on September 19 over the North Atlantic . It moved quickly northeastward , reaching 65 m winds before becoming extratropical on September 21 . As an extratropical system , it became incredibly powerful , reaching a central pressure of 944 m , a reading typical of a strong Category 3 hurricane . Subtropical Storm Delta developed from a cold-core low . The low moved southwestward in late October , and on November 1 it developed into a subtropical depression . On November 2 , it became Subtropical Storm Delta . It moved southwestward initially , then eastward on November 4 , where it met unfavorable conditions . Delta became a depression again on November 5 , and ultimately dissipated on November 7 . The following names were used for named storms ( tropical storms and hurricanes ) that formed in the North Atlantic in 1972 . Names that were not assigned are marked in . Storms were named Agnes , Betty and Dawn for the first time in 1972 . The name Agnes was later retired . The following names were used for subtropical storms ( sometimes called neutercanes ) in the Atlantic basin for this year . This year was the first year to use the Phonetic Alphabet for these storms . Names that were not assigned are marked in .

Recording is a process of capturing data or translating information to a format stored on a storage medium often referred to as a record . Historical records of events have been made for thousands of years in one form or another . Amongst the earliest are cave painting , runic alphabets and ideograms . Ways of recording text suitable for direct reading by humans includes writing it on paper . Other forms of data storage are easier for automatic retrieval , but humans need a tool to read them . Printing a text stored in a computer allows keeping a copy on the computer and having also a copy that is human-readable without a tool . Technology continues to provide and expand means for human beings to represent , record and express their thoughts , feelings and experiences .
Mycology ( from the Greek Î 1\/4 Ï Î Î Ï , mukÄ `` s , meaning `` fungus '' ) is the branch of biology concerned with the study of fungi , including their genetic and biochemical properties , their taxonomy and their use to humans as a source for tinder , medicinals ( e.g. , penicillin ) , food ( e.g. , beer , wine , cheese , edible mushrooms ) and entheogens , as well as their dangers , such as poisoning or infection . From mycology arose the field of phytopathology , the study of plant diseases , and the two disciplines remain closely related because the vast majority of plant pathogens are fungi . A biologist who studies mycology is called a mycologist . Historically , mycology was a branch of botany because , although fungi are evolutionarily more closely related to animals than to plants , this was not recognized until a few decades ago . Pioneer mycologists included Elias Magnus Fries , Christian Hendrik Persoon , Anton de Bary and Lewis David von Schweinitz . Today the most comprehensively studied and understood fungi are yeasts and eukaryotic model organisms Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Many fungi produce toxins , antibiotics and other secondary metabolites . For example the cosmopolitan ( worldwide ) genus Fusarium and their toxins associated with fatal outbreaks of alimentary toxic aleukia in humans were extensively studied by Abraham Joffe . Fungi are fundamental for life on earth in their roles as symbionts , e.g. in the form of mycorrhizae , insect symbionts and lichens . Many fungi are able to break down complex organic biomolecules such as lignin , the more durable component of wood , and pollutants such as xenobiotics , petroleum , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons . By decomposing these molecules , fungi play a critical role in the global carbon cycle . Fungi and other organisms traditionally recognized as fungi , such as oomycetes and myxomycetes ( slime molds ) , often are economically and socially important as some cause diseases of animals ( such as histoplasmosis ) as well as plants ( such as Dutch elm disease and Rice blast ) . Field meetings to find interesting species of fungi are known as ` forays ' , after the first such meeting organized by the Woolhope Naturalists ' Field Club in 1868 and entitled `` a foray among the fungi . '' Some fungi can cause disease in humans or other organisms . The study of pathogenic fungi is referred to as medical mycology . Humans probably started collecting mushrooms as food in Prehistoric times . Mushrooms were first written about in the works of Euripides ( 480-406 B.C. ) . The Greek philosopher Theophrastos of Eressos ( 371-288 B.C. ) was perhaps the first to try to systematically classify plants ; mushrooms were considered to be plants that were missing certain organs . It was later Pliny the elder ( 23 -- 79 A.D. ) , who wrote about truffles in his encyclopedia Naturalis historia . The Middle Ages saw little advancement in the body of knowledge about fungi . Rather , the invention of the printing press allowed some authors to disseminate superstitions and misconceptions about the fungi that had been perpetuated by the classical authors . The start of the modern age of mycology begins with Pier Antonio Micheli 's 1737 publication of Nova plantarum genera . Published in Florence , this seminal work laid the foundations for the systematic classification of grasses , mosses and fungi . The term mycology and the complimentary mycologist were first used in 1836 by M.J. Berkeley . For centuries , certain mushrooms have been documented as a folk medicine in China , Japan , and Russia . Although the use of mushrooms in folk medicine is largely centered on the Asian continent , people in other parts of the world like the Middle East , Poland and Belarus have been documented using mushrooms for medicinal purposes . Certain mushrooms , especially polypores like Reishi were thought to be able to benefit a wide variety of health ailments . Medicinal mushroom research in the United States is currently active , with studies taking place at City of Hope National Medical Center , as well as the Memorial Sloanâ `` Kettering Cancer Center . Current research focuses on mushrooms that may have hypoglycemic activity , anti-cancer activity , anti-pathogenic activity , and immune system enhancing activity . Recent research has found that the oyster mushroom naturally contains the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin , mushrooms produce large amounts of vitamin D when exposed to UV light , and that certain fungi may be a future source of taxol . To date , penicillin , lovastatin , ciclosporin , griseofulvin , cephalosporin , ergometrine , and statins are the most famous pharmaceuticals which have been isolated from the fungi kingdom .

Prince of Wales is the title traditionally given to the heir apparent to the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom . It originated as the title of independent princes of Wales in the 12th and 13th centuries .
Mercury ( I ) chloride is the chemical compound with the formula Hg2Cl2 . Also known as calomel ( a mineral form , rarely found in nature ) or mercurous chloride , this dense white or yellowish-white , odorless solid is the principal example of a mercury ( I ) compound . It is a component of reference electrodes in electrochemistry . The name calomel is thought to come from the Greek Î Î Î '' Ï Ï beautiful , and Î 1\/4 Î Î '' Î Ï black . This name ( somewhat surprising for a white compound ) is probably due to its characteristic disproportionation reaction with ammonia , which gives a spectacular black coloration due to the finely dispersed metallic mercury formed . It is also referred to as the mineral horn quicksilver or horn mercury . Calomel was taken internally and used as a laxative and disinfectant , as well as in the treatment of syphilis , until the early 20th century . Mercury became a popular remedy for a variety of physical and mental ailments during the age of `` heroic medicine . '' It was used by doctors in America throughout the 18th century , and during the revolution , to make patients regurgitate and release their body from `` impurities '' . Benjamin Rush , a famed physician in colonial Philadelphia and signatory to the Declaration of Independence , was one particular well-known advocate of mercury in medicine and famously used calomel to treat sufferers of yellow fever during its outbreak in the city in 1793 . Calomel was given to patients as a purgative until they began to salivate . However , it was often administered to patients in such great quantities that their hair and teeth fell out . Shortly after yellow fever struck Philadelphia , the disease broke out in Jamaica . A war of words broke out in the newspapers concerning the best treatment for yellow fever ; bleeding or calomel . Anecdotal evidence indicates calomel was more effective than bleeding . Mercury is unique among the group 12 metals for its ability to form the M -- M bond so readily . Hg2Cl2 is a linear molecule . The unit cell of the crystal structure is shown below : The Hg -- Hg bond length of 253 pm ( Hg -- Hg in the metal is 300 pm ) and the Hg -- Cl bond length in the linear Hg2Cl2 unit is 243 pm . The overall coordination of each Hg atom is octahedral as , in addition to the two nearest neighbors , there are four other Cl atoms at 321 pm . Longer mercury polycations exist . : Hg + HgCl2 â ' Hg2Cl2 It can be prepared via metathesis reaction involving aqueous mercury ( I ) nitrate using various chloride sources including NaCl or HCl . Mercurous chloride is employed extensively in electrochemistry , taking advantage of the ease of its oxidation and reduction reactions . The calomel electrode is a reference electrode , especially in older publications . Over the past 50 years , it has been superseded by the silver\/silver chloride ( Ag\/AgCl ) electrode . Although the mercury electrodes have been widely abandoned due to the dangerous nature of mercury , many chemists believe they are still more accurate and are not dangerous as long as they are handled properly . The differences in experimental potentials vary little from literature values . Other electrodes can vary by 70 to 100 millivolts . Mercurous chloride decomposes into mercury ( II ) chloride and elemental mercury upon exposure to UV light . : Hg2Cl2 â ' HgCl2 + Hg The formation of Hg can be used to calculate the number of photons in the light beam , by the technique of actinometry . By utilizing a light reaction in the presence of mercury ( II ) chloride and ammonium oxalate , mercury ( I ) chloride , ammonium chloride and carbon dioxide is produced . :2 HgCl2 + ( NH4 ) 2C2O4 + Light â ' Hg2Cl2 ( s ) + 2 ( NH4 + ) ( Clâ ' ) + 2CO2 This particular reaction was discovered by J.M. Eder ( hence the name Eder reaction ) in 1880 and reinvestigated by W. E. Rosevaere in 1929 Mercury ( I ) bromide , Hg2Br2 , a light yellow , whereas mercury ( I ) iodide , Hg2I2 , is greenish in color . Both are poorly soluble . Mercury ( I ) fluoride is unstable in the absence of a strong acid . Mercurous chloride is toxic , although due to its low solubility in water it is generally less dangerous than its mercuric chloride counterpart . It was used in medicine as a diuretic and purgative ( laxative ) in the United States from the early 1830s through the 1860s . Calomel was also a common ingredient in teething powders in Britain up until 1954 , causing widespread mercury poisoning in the form of pink disease , which at the time had a mortality rate of 1 in 10 . These medicinal uses were later discontinued when the compound 's toxicity was discovered . It has also found uses in cosmetics as soaps and skin lightening creams , but these preparations are now illegal to manufacture or import in many countries including U.S. , Canada , Japan and Europe . A study of workers involved in the production of these preparations showed that the sodium salt of 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid ( DMPS ) was effective in lowering the body burden of mercury and in decreasing the urinary mercury concentration to normal levels .
Carpooling ( also known as car-sharing , ride-sharing , lift-sharing and covoiturage ) , is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car . Carpooling reduces the costs involved in car travel by sharing journey expenses such as fuel , tolls , and car rental between the people traveling . Carpooling is also seen as a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys reduces carbon emissions , traffic on the roads , and the need for parking spaces . Authorities often encourage carpooling , especially during high pollution periods and after fuel rises . Carpooling where the driving is shared can also decrease driving stress as each driver gets a break from being at the wheel . Carpooling uses private or jointly hired vehicles , for private shared journeys . The vehicle is not used in a general public transport capacity such as in car sharing , share taxis or taxicabs . Carpooling also differs from other sharing schemes such as where company\/government or private vehicles are used by several people at different times . Drivers and passengers offer and search for journeys through one of the several mediums available . After finding a match they contact each other to arrange any details for the journey ( s ) . Costs , meeting points and other details like space for luggage are discussed and agreed on . They then meet and carry out their shared car journey ( s ) as planned . Carpooling is commonly implemented for commuting but is also popular for longer one-off journeys , with the formality and regularity of arrangements varying between schemes and journeys . Carpooling is not always arranged for the whole length of a journey . Especially on long journeys , it is common for passengers to only join for parts of the journey , and give a contribution based on the distance that they travel . This gives carpooling extra flexibility , and enables more people to share journeys and save money . In an effort to reduce traffic and encourage carpooling some countries have introduced high-occupancy vehicle ( HOV ) lanes in which only vehicles with two or more passengers are allowed to drive . In some countries it is also common to find parking spaces that are reserved especially for carpoolers . Many companies and local authorities have introduced carpooling schemes , often as part of wider transport programs . Carpooling schemes have been around since the mid-1970s , but have reached new levels since the arrival of the internet . The popularity of the internet and mobile phones has greatly helped carpooling to expand , by enabling people to offer and find rides more easily , and easily contact each other to arrange them . Carpooling also exists in other forms such as Slugging which is a form of ad-hoc carpooling between strangers . No money changes hands , but a mutual benefit still exists between the driver and passenger ( s ) making the practice worthwhile . Carpooling can struggle to be flexible enough to accommodate en-route stops or changes to working times\/patterns . To counter this some schemes offer ` sweeper services ' with later running options , or a ` guaranteed ride home ' arrangement with a local taxi company . Another problem for carpooling is the reliability of the informal arrangements made between the parties involved . Due to the lack of formality , occasionally passengers or drivers do not turn up for the journeys that they have arranged , wasting the time of and increasing the costs for others involved . Several internet carpooling schemes are addressing this problem by introducing booking systems , enabling payments to be made even if passengers do not turn up , and blocks to be more easily put in place if drivers are found to be unreliable .
La Hoguette is a commune in the Calvados department in the Basse-Normandie region in northwestern France . La Hoguette is also the type site of the early Neolithic La Hoguette culture that is found mainly in association with Linearbandkeramic or Limburg pottery in Northern France , The Netherlands , Alsace and Western Germany . It is believed to ultimately derive from the Mediterranean Cardial-Traditions . Important sites of the La-Hoguette culture include Stuttgart-Wilhelma , Dautenheim and Godelau . The La Hoguette pottery was found under a later megalithic tomb and first misidentified as Linearbandkeramic . La Hoguette marks the westernmost point of the distribution of this culture . The place name La Hoguette is believed to derive from the Old Norse word Haugr meaning a knoll or a hill . La Hoguette was the birthplace of Georges Marchais ( 1920 â `` 1997 ) , head of the French Communist Party .

Soul blues is a style of blues music developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s that combines elements of soul music and urban contemporary music . Singers and musicians who grew up listening to the traditional electric blues of artists such as Muddy Waters , Bo Diddley , Jimmy Reed and Elmore James ; soul singers such as Sam Cooke , Ray Charles and Otis Redding ; and gospel music wanted to bridge their favorite music together . Bobby Bland was one of the pioneers of this style . This is a sub-genre of blues that is very popular with African American audiences but less known by white audiences . The style continues to be popular in the new millennium .

This list of former players includes those who received international caps while playing for the team , made significant contributions to the team in terms of appearances or goals , or who made significant contributions to the sport either before they played for the team , or after they left . It is clearly not yet complete and all inclusive , and additions and refinements will continue to be made over time .
Dan Simmons ( born April 4 , 1948 in Peoria , Illinois ) is an American author most widely known for his Hugo Award-winning science fiction series , known as the Hyperion Cantos , and for his Locus-winning Ilium\/Olympos cycle . He spans genres such as science fiction , horror and fantasy , sometimes within the same novel : a typical example of Simmons ' ability to intermingle genres is Song of Kali ( 1985 ) , winner of World Fantasy Award . He is also a respected author of mysteries and thrillers , some of which feature the continuing character Joe Kurtz . Simmons received an A.B. in English from Wabash College in 1970 , and , in 1971 , a Masters in Education from Washington University in St. Louis , Missouri . He subsequently worked in elementary education until 1989 . He soon started to write short stories , although his career did not take off until 1982 , when , through Harlan Ellison 's help , his short story `` The River Styx Runs Upstream '' was published and awarded first prize in a Twilight Zone Magazine story competition . His first novel , Song of Kali , was released in 1985 . Summer of Night ( 1991 ) recounts the childhood of a group of pre-teens who band together in the 1960s to defeat a centuries-old evil that terrorizes their hometown of Elm Haven , Illinois . The novel , which was praised by Stephen King , is similar to King 's It in its focus on small town life , the corruption of innocence , the return of an ancient evil , and the responsibility for others that emerges with the transition from youth to adulthood . In the sequel to Summer of Night , A Winter Haunting , Dale Stewart ( one of the first book 's protagonists , and now an adult ) , revisits his boyhood home to come to grips with mysteries that have disrupted his adult life . Children of the Night , another loose sequel , features a much older Mike O'Rourke , now a Roman Catholic priest , who is sent on a mission to investigate bizarre events in a European city . Another Summer of Night character , Dale 's younger brother , Lawrence Stewart , appears as a minor character in Simmons ' thriller Darwin 's Blade , while the adult Cordie Cooke appears in Fires of Eden . Soon after Summer of Night , Simmons , who had written mostly horror fiction , began to focus on writing science fiction , although in 2007 he returned with a work of historical fiction and horror , The Terror . In 2009 he also wrote a book , Drood , based on Charles Dickens ' The Mystery of Edwin Drood . Simmons became famous in 1989 for Hyperion , winner of Hugo and Locus Awards for the best science fiction novel . This novel deals with a space war , and is inspired in its structure by Boccaccio 's Decameron and Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales . Early in 2001 , Simmons began writing a series of hard-boiled crime-fiction novels featuring Joe Kurtz as a lead character . The first , Hardcase , was followed by Hard Freeze and Hard as Nails in 2002 and 2003 respectively . In January 2004 , it was announced that the screenplay he wrote for his novels Ilium and Olympos would be made into a film by Digital Domain and Barnet Bain Films , with Simmons acting as executive producer . Ilium is described as an `` epic tale that spans 5,000 years and sweeps across the entire solar system , including themes and characters from Homer 's Iliad and Shakespeare 's The Tempest . '' In July 2004 , Ilium received a Locus Award for best science fiction novel of 2003 . Scott Derrickson is set to direct `` Hyperion Cantos '' for Warner Bros. and GK Films . Trevor Sands is penning the script which will blend the first two cantos `` Hyperion '' and `` The Fall of Hyperion '' into one film . His novel Drood is set to be adapted into a movie by Guillermo del Toro for Universal Pictures . Dan Simmons has been nominated on numerous occasions in a range of categories for his fiction , including the Arthur C. Clarke Award , Bram Stoker Award , British Fantasy Society Award , Hugo Award , Nebula Award , and World Fantasy Award .
A time server is a server computer that reads the actual time from a reference clock and distributes this information to its clients using a computer network . The time server may be a local network time server or an internet time server . The most important and widely-used protocol for distributing and synchronising time is the Network Time Protocol ( NTP ) , though other less-popular or outdated time protocols continue in use . The time reference used by a time server could be another time server on the network or the Internet , a connected radio clock or an atomic clock . The most common true time source is a GPS or GPS master clock . Time servers are sometimes multi-purpose network servers , dedicated network servers , or dedicated devices . All a dedicated time server does is provide accurate time . An existing network server ( e.g. a file server ) can become a time server with additional software . The NTP homepage provides a free and widely-used reference implementation of the NTP server and client for many popular operating systems . The other choice is a dedicated time server device . The term `` stratum '' is used to label the closeness to a central or high quality time server . The stratum indicates the place of a particular time server in a hierarchy of servers . The scale is 0 to 14 where 0 is the most accurate and likely a highly specialized physical hardware device . Some time clients will reject a time update from a server whose stratum is too high , and most will prefer low strata time sources to higher ones . This can be a pitfall for administrators setting up an in-house time server with no true time source .

RingkÃ bing is a town in RingkÃ bing-Skjern municipality in Region Midtjylland on the west coast of the Jutland peninsula in west Denmark . The town has a population of 9,850 ( 1 January 2010 ) . Archeological finds suggest that the town was founded in the 13th century . At that time it was the only real harbor town along the Danish west coast , being sheltered from the North Sea by the wall of Holmsland Dunes ( Holmsland Klit ) . In the 17th century the exit out of RingkÃ bing Fjord started moving south , caused by wind and tide ; RingkÃ bing was then cut off from the sea . It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that a new opening to the sea was created at the town of Hvide Sande , in nearby Holmsland municipality . This enabled boats to come to RingkÃ bing again from the North Sea . The name RingkÃ bing means `` The market town near Rindum '' . Already in the 11th century , a church was built in the small village Rindum . The village is probably even older , and there has been found proof of settlements dating as far back as the 6th century . Today the center of RingkÃ bing has some quaint old streets , most of which lead towards the water of the fjord . RingkÃ bing Church was built in the early 15th century , and its tower , which is wider on top than on the bottom , was erected ca . 1550 . The church houses two organs : the oldest in the west pulpit was built by Demant & Son in 1861 with a baroque facade from 1633 ; the other from 1974 is by Frobenius & Sons . As the result of a restoration in 1995-1996 , the church has a number of modern features , including an altarpiece by Arne Haugen SÃ rensen and a glass baptismal font .
The Hyundai i20 is a supermini\/subcompact car , made its debut at the Paris Motor Show in October 2008 and went on the sale in December 2008 in India to fit between the i10 and i30 . It is a Front wheel drive car . Three and five door versions are available ( Both have different sleek window shapes ) . The i20 replaces the Getz in most markets but in the UK and India , the Getz will still be available for the time being . The i20 is assembled in Turkey ( Izmit plant ) for the European market and in Sriperumbudur ( near Chennai ) , India for sale in Asia and Oceania . The i20 is not sold in Korea , as the similar , Korea-built Click ( Which is also known as the Hyundai Getz in the UK ) sold there . It is also not sold in the North American market ( U.S. and Canada ) , where the slightly larger Accent is the entry model . The Hyundai i20 uses a completely new platform that was created at Hyundai 's European technical center in RÃ 1\/4 sselsheim to allow Hyundai to move into Europe 's highly competitive supermini segment . A 2525 m wheelbase helps endow the i20 with a generous passenger cabin . Suspension follows the supermini norm of MacPherson struts at the front and a torsion beam rear end with rack and pinion steering . The i20 will debut in Europe with a total of seven engine options , all with four cylinders . Three are petrol , including the recently designed 1248 cc dohc 16 valve `` Kappa '' engine , while the rest are diesel engines . Two of the diesel engines are 1396 cc units , one with 75 P and 220 N and the other a 90 P and 220 N high power unit . They are joined by two 1582 cc engines having the same dohc and 16-valve top end architecture but delivering either 115 P and 260 N of torque or 128 P and 260 N of torque . Hyundai claims that 115 P diesel unit can return a class leading 115g\/km of CO2 while sipping just one litre of HSD to go 23.25 k ( 4.3 L\/100 km ) in the European combined driving cycle . All diesel engines and 1.2 and 1.4 petrol engines come mated to five-speed manual transmission , there is an option of a four-speed automatic for some 1.4 petrol engined models , the 1.6 is mated to a six-speed manual transmission . In Indian market Hyundai i20 is powered by an 1.2 L kappa engine with 80 P power at 5200 rpm and 114 N torque at 4000rpm . i20 also comes with a 1.4 L gamma gasoline which has 100 P power at 5500 rpm and 139 N torque at 4200 rpm , but this engine is only available with an automatic transmission . The i20 CRDi diesel has 90 P at 4000 rpm and 224 N torque between 1750 â `` 2750 rpm . The Hyundai i20 earned from Euro NCAP a maximum 5 star safety rating and scored an impressive six out of a maximum seven points in the `` safety assist '' category , receiving top marks for its belt reminder and electronic stability program which minimises the risk of skidding by braking individual wheels . The i20 was named one of Euro NCAP 's `` top five safest cars for 2009 '' , which was based on Euro NCAP 's maximum five star awards and their overall score .

Laboratory flasks are vessels ( containers ) which fall into the category of laboratory equipment known as glassware . In laboratory and other scientific settings , they are usually referred to simply as flasks . Flasks come in a number of shapes and a wide range of sizes , but a common distinguishing aspect in their shapes is a wider vessel `` body '' and one ( or sometimes more ) narrower tubular sections at the top called necks which have an opening at the top . Laboratory flask sizes are specified by the volume they can hold , typically in metric units such as milliliters ( mL or ml ) or liters ( L or l ) . Laboratory flasks have traditionally been made of glass , but can also be made of plastic . At the opening ( s ) at top of the neck of some glass flasks such as round-bottom flasks , retorts , or sometimes volumetric flasks , there are outer ( or female ) tapered ( conical ) ground glass joints . Some flasks , especially volumetric flasks , come with a stopper or cap for capping the opening at the top of the neck . Such stoppers can be made of glass or plastic . Glass stoppers typically have a matching tapered inner ( or male ) ground glass joint surface , but often only of stopper quality . Flasks which do not come with such stoppers or caps included may be capped with a rubber bung or cork stopper . Flasks can be used for making solutions or for holding , containing , collecting , or sometimes volumetrically measuring chemicals , samples , solutions , etc. for chemical reactions or other processes such as mixing , heating , cooling , dissolving , precipitation , boiling ( as in distillation ) , or analysis . There are several types of laboratory flasks , all of which have different functions within the laboratory . Flasks , because of their use , can be divided into : Many of these flasks can be wrapped in a protective outer layer of glass , leaving a gap between the inner and outer walls . These are called jacketed flasks ; they are often used in a reaction using a cooling fluid . Like many other common pieces of glassware , Erlenmeyer flasks could potentially be used in the production of drugs . In an effort to restrict such production , some U.S. states ( including Texas ) have made possession of common flasks illegal without permit , including Erlenmeyer flasks , as well as chemicals identified as common starting materials .

The water hemisphere , sometimes capitalized as the Water Hemisphere , is the hemisphere on the Earth containing the largest area of water . It is centered on , near New Zealand 's Bounty Islands . The other half of the earth is the land hemisphere , which is centered in Nantes , France . The water hemisphere has only one-eighth of the world 's land , including Australia , New Zealand , Antarctica , the Malay Archipelago , and the southern part of South America . Most of the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean are on the water hemisphere . The area of the oceans of the water hemisphere is much larger than its land area , but the area of the oceans of the land hemisphere is still larger than its land area .
Southgate is a London Underground Piccadilly Line station in Southgate . It is located between Arnos Grove and Oakwood stations and is in Travelcard Zone 4 . Southgate station opened on 13 March 1933 with Oakwood on the second phase of the northern extension of the Piccadilly line from Finsbury Park to Cockfosters . Prior to the station 's opening , alternative names were suggested including `` Chase Side '' and `` Southgate Central '' . On opening , local residents were given a free return ticket to Piccadilly Circus . The station is built in the Art Deco\/Streamline Moderne design style using brick , reinforced concrete and glass and is one of the best known of the many stations Charles Holden designed for London Underground . The station building is circular with a flat projecting concrete roof . Externally , the flat roof of the raised central section appears , impossibly , to be supported by nothing more than a horizontal band of windows that provide daylight to the ticket hall . The roof is actually supported , umbrella-like , from a central column within the ticket hall . The whole building is topped by an illuminated feature resembling a Tesla coil . Like Arnos Grove , Oakwood and Cockfosters , Southgate is a listed building in this case at Grade II \* ( regraded from Grade 2 in 2009 ) and retains much of its original decoration . The two escalators have the original column lighting , while bronze panelling is in evidence throughout the station . However ; the station is not without change : in the late 1990s , one of the three entrances was filled in to be used as a new ticket office , and due to the design of the automatic barriers , one of the two remaining entrances is exit only . In 2008 the station was extensively renovated , with new tiling at platform level , a partial new floor in the main ticket hall , and improved signage throughout . The station won the London Regional category award at the 2008 National Railway Heritage Awards for the modernisation of a heritage station . The preserved condition of the station 's original features , particularly the escalators , makes Southgate popular for filming scenes for period dramas , including scenes for the 1999 version of the film , The End of the Affair . The station was developed as a bus\/underground interchange and the main building sits on an island between Southgate Circus and Station Parade where a series of bus stops are located . A secondary building containing shops wraps around the other side of the parade . The station is located on a hill and whereas the platforms at the stations on each side are on the surface those at Southgate are in a short section of tunnel . The tunnel portals are visible from the platforms when looking north , a unique occurrence for a deep-level London Underground station . As usual on the Piccadilly Line , the platforms are labeled Westbound and Eastbound . However , the tunnels run roughly north-south at Southgate , so eastbound is northbound and westbound is southbound . In the early 1980s , moving picture advertising was tested in the tunnels south of the station . The pictures were of a child on a beach turning to face the camera . Southgate is the northernmost below ground station on the London Underground network . Bus routes 121 , 125 , 298 , 299 , 382 , 628 , 688 , 699 , W6 , 616 and N91 serve Southgate Station .

The authors of this paper revised the subfamilies and tribes of the order . Ranunculaceae ( buttercup or crowfoot family ; Latin rÄ nunculus `` little frog '' , from rÄ na `` frog '' ) is a family of about 1700 species of flowering plants in about 60 genera , distributed worldwide . The largest genera are Ranunculus ( 600 species ) , Delphinium ( 365 ) , Thalictrum ( 330 ) , Clematis ( 325 ) , and Aconitum ( 300 ) . Ranunculaceae are mostly herbaceous plants , but with some woody climbers ( such as Clematis ) and subshrubs ( e.g. Xanthorhiza ) . Members of the Ranunculaceae usually have five colored sepals instead of petals ( except Buttercups ) ; divided leaves and non-woody tissue ( except Clematis ) Leaves are usually divided or lobed , but are heart-shaped or narrow and undivided in some species of Ranunculus and usually arise from the base of the plant , or alternately up the stem , but in Clematis they are opposite . Perennial species form a small rhizomes or tubers which develop new roots each year . Flowers may be solitary , but are frequently found aggregated in cymes , panicles or spikes . Many species have no true petals , and the ` flower ' is formed by a brightly colored calyx . There are usually five sepals , although there are many which come in a wide variety of shapes . Ranunculus , ( Buttercups ) , is the only genus in this family with a true calyx and petals . There are many stamens surrounding many fused carpels . The fruit is most commonly a follicle ( e. g. Helleborus , Nigella ) or an achene ( e. g. Ranunculus , Clematis ) . Ranunculaceae contain protoanemonin , which is toxic to humans and animals . Other poisonous or toxic compounds , alkaloids and glycosides , are also very common . The family Ranunculaceae is included in the Ranunculales which is the sole order of the Ranunculanae , a superorder of eudicots according to APG 3 systematics . The phylogeny is well illustrated in Â According to Dr John David , ( 2010 ) the Ranuculaceae are combined with the Eupteleaceae , Lardizabalaceae , Menispermaceae , Berberidaceae , and Papaveraceae in the Ranunculales , the only order in the superorder Ranunculanae . This follows the work of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group . Takhtajan 1997 includes the Ranunculaceae as the only family in the Ranunculales which he placed in a subclass , the Ranunculidae , instead of a superorder . Previously , Thorn 1992 placed the Ranunculaceae in the Berberidales , an order within the Superorder Magnolianae . Earlier Cronquist in 1981 included the Ranunculaceae along with seven other families in the Rancunculales which was included in the Magnoliidae , which he regarded as a subclass . The cladogram below is according to the APG II system , based on molecular phylogeny . The genus Glaucidium was once put in its own family ( Glaucidiaceae ) , but has been recently recognized as a primitive member of Ranunculaceae . Tamura ( 1993 ) recognized five subfamilies , mainly based on chromosomic and floral characteristics ( Hydrastidoideae , Thalictroideae , Isopyroideae , Ranunculoideae , Helleboroideae ) . Hydrastidoideae and Glaucidioideae have only one species , Hydrastis canadense and Glaucidium palmatum respectively . Coptoideae has 17 species and Thalictroideae has 450 , including Thalictrum and Aquilegia . The other genera ( 2025 species , 81 % of the family ) belong to Ranunculoideae . Some older classifications included Paeonia ( peony ) in Ranunculaceae but this genus is now placed in its own family , Paeoniaceae in order Saxifragales . Circaeaster and Kingdonia are now placed in Circaeasteraceae . Fossils of fruits , pollen , seeds , and leaves are known from several dozen locations . The fossil record begins in the early Cretaceous and continues throughout the Tertiary . In most cases , the fossils are assigned to extant genera , or show a close relationship to a particular extant genus . Some Ranunculaceae are used as herbal medicines because of their alkaloids and glycosides , such as Hydrastis canadensis ( goldenseal ) , whose root is used as a tonic . Many genera are well known as cultivated flowers , such as Aconitum ( monkshood ) , Consolida ( larkspur ) , Delphinium , Helleborus ( Christmas rose ) , Trollius ( globeflower ) .
Sauber Petronas Engineering AG was a company owned jointly by the Swiss racing car manufacturer Sauber ( 60 % ) and the Malaysian oil company Petronas ( 40 % ) . The company was founded for the sole purpose of building engines to the Sauber formula one team . The engines were for many years nearly identical to the ones used by Ferrari but were branded Petronas . Sauber licenced nearly every legally licensable part from Ferrari and even had several Ferrari engineers on staff . Many pointed out suspicious similarities between Ferrari and Sauber chassis , but no formal accusations were ever made , even if FIA rules require each team to design their own chassis . After the 2005 season , Sauber was bought by BMW and the cooperation with Ferrari ended . On December 21 , 2009 , Petronas was confirmed as moving from BMW Sauber to the newly formed Mercedes Grand Prix team . The company also helped develop motorcycles like Petronas FP1 .

Thalassa ( , or as in Greek Î Î Î '' Î Ï Ï Î ) , also known as Neptune IV , is the second innermost satellite of Neptune . Thalassa was named after sea goddesss Thalassa , a daughter of Aether and Hemera from Greek mythology . `` Thalassa '' is also the Greek word for `` sea '' . Thalassa was discovered sometime before mid-September 1989 from the images taken by the Voyager 2 probe . It was given the temporary designation S\/1989 N 5 . The discovery was announced ( IAUC 4867 ) on September 29 , 1989 , but the text only talks of `` 25 frames taken over 11 days '' , giving a discovery date of sometime before September 18 . The name was given on 16 September 1991 . Thalassa is irregularly shaped and shows no sign of any geological modification . It is likely that it is a rubble pile re-accreted from fragments of Neptune 's original satellites , which were smashed up by perturbations from Triton soon after that moon 's capture into a very eccentric initial orbit . Unusually for irregular bodies , it appears to be roughly disk-shaped . Since the Thalassian orbit is below Neptune 's synchronous orbit radius , it is slowly spiralling inward due to tidal deceleration and may eventually impact Neptune 's atmosphere , or break up into a planetary ring upon passing its Roche limit due to tidal stretching . Relatively soon after , the spreading debris may impinge upon Despina 's orbit .
Whitchurch is a market town in Shropshire , England on the border between England and Wales . It is the oldest continuously inhabited town in Shropshire . According to the 2001 Census , the population of the town is 8,673 , with a more recent estimate putting the population of the town at 8,934 .

Whitchurch was also junction for the Whitchurch and Tattenhall Railway or Chester to Whitchurch branch line , another part of the London and North Western , and running via Malpas . As well as its own passenger and freight services , this line was a useful short cut for freight traffic to and from Chester and North Wales avoiding Crewe , and some long-distance passenger services were occasionally diverted this way . Although the line closed to regular services on 16 September 1957 , the diverted passenger trains continued until 8 December 1963 .

He then transferred to Blackburn Rovers for the 2004-05 season , but left the club after playing in only three games . Djorkaeff then signed with the MetroStars of Major League Soccer in February 2005 for $ 180,000 plus incentives , turning down higher paid offers from other countries . He became the first French player to play in MLS and ended the season as the team 's MVP with ten goals and seven assists in league play . Djorkaeff announced from the beginning that he would hang-up his boots at the end of 2006 season , and played for the re-branded New York Red Bulls . On 1 July 2006 , he was spotted in the crowd with French fans at the FIFA World Cup quarter-final match between France and Brazil after telling Red Bulls officials he left the club to attend to `` an unexpected , serious family matter in France . '' Upon his return , he revealed that the purpose of his departure was to be with his sick mother and downplayed watching the World Cup match . He retired from football on 29 October 2006 , after being sidelined in the second leg of the MLS Eastern Conference semi-finals because of an ankle injury . Djorkaeff won the Cup Winners ' Cup with Paris Saint-Germain in 1996 and the UEFA Cup with Internazionale in 1998 . He accumulated 82 caps and scored 28 goals for France . Other than the two major tournament ( the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the UEFA Euro 2000 ) , Djorkaeff also played for his country in UEFA Euro 1996 and the 2002 FIFA World Cup . Djorkaeff released a singing single called `` Vivre dans Ta LumiÃ re '' , translated to `` Living in Your Light '' from French .
Naiad ( or ; ) , also known as Neptune III , is the innermost satellite of Neptune , named after the Naiads of Greek legend . Naiad was discovered sometime before mid-September 1989 from the images taken by the Voyager 2 probe . The last moon to be discovered during the flyby , it was designated S\/1989 N 6 . The discovery was announced on September 29 , 1989 , in the IAU Circular No. 4867 , but the text only talks of `` 25 frames taken over 11 days '' , giving a discovery date of sometime before September 18 . The name was given on 16 September 1991 . Naiad is irregularly shaped and probably has not been modified by any internal geological processes after its formation . It is likely that it is a rubble pile re-accreted from fragments of Neptune 's original satellites , which were smashed up by perturbations from Triton soon after that moon 's capture into a very eccentric initial orbit . Naiad orbits about 23,500 km above Neptune 's cloud tops . Since this is below the synchronous orbit radius , its orbit is slowly decaying due to tidal deceleration and may eventually impact Neptune 's atmosphere , or break up into a planetary ring upon passing its Roche limit due to tidal stretching . Naiad orbits Neptune well within its fluid Roche limit , and its density is expected to be low enough that it may be very close to its actual Roche limit already . Since the Voyager 2 flyby , the Neptune system has been extensively studied from ground-based observatories and the Hubble Space Telescope as well . In 2002-03 the Keck telescope observed the system using adaptive optics and detected easily the largest four inner satellites . Thalassa was found with some image processing , but Naiad was not located . Hubble has the ability to detect all the known satellites and possible new satellites even dimmer than Voyager 2 . Still , Naiad has not been found . It is suspected that this is due to considerable errors in Naiad 's ephemeris .
La Cropte is a commune in the Mayenne department in north-western France . The Vaige forms most of the commune 's north-western border , then flows southeastwards through the middle of the commune .
The United States Secretary of Homeland Security is the head of the United States Department of Homeland Security , the body concerned with protecting the American homeland and the safety of American citizens . The Secretary is a member of the President 's Cabinet . The position was created by the Homeland Security Act following the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . The new department consisted primarily of components transferred from other cabinet departments because of their role in homeland security , such as the Coast Guard , Federal Protective Service , U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( which includes the Border Patrol ) , Secret Service , and the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) . It did not , however , include the FBI or the CIA . On January 20 , 2009 , the Senate confirmed Barack Obama 's appointment of Janet Napolitano to be the third Secretary of Homeland Security . To assure a smooth transition however , Michael Chertoff was asked not to resign until the morning of January 21 , 2009 . Traditionally , the order of the presidential line of succession is determined ( after the Vice President , Speaker of the House , and President pro tempore of the Senate ) by the order of the creation of the cabinet positions , and is mandated as such under . On March 9 , 2006 , President Bush signed as , which renewed the Patriot Act and amended the Presidential Succession Act to include the Secretary of Homeland Security in the line of succession after the Secretary of Veterans Affairs ( Â 503 ) . In the 109th Congress , legislation was introduced to place the Secretary of Homeland Security into the line of succession after the Attorney General but that bill expired at the end of the 109th Congress and has not been re-introduced . Prior to the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security , there existed an Assistant to the President for the Office of Homeland Security , which was created following the September 11 , 2001 attacks .
Several farms in the area , Hill Farm to the west and Jarvis Farm to the southeast . Long Melford ( or Melford , as it is known locally ) is a large village and civil parish in the county of Suffolk , England . It is on Suffolk 's border with Essex , which is marked by the River Stour , approximately 16 m from Colchester and 14 m from Bury St. Edmunds . The parish also includes the hamlets of Bridge Street and Cuckoo Tye . Its name is derived from the nature of the village 's layout ( originally concentrated along a 3 mile stretch of a single road ) and the Mill ford crossing the Chad Brook ( a tributary of the River Stour ) . The area now occupied by Long Melford has been occupied since at least 100 B.C. . The village 's layout was defined in Roman times with the empire building two roads thorough Melford , the main one running from Chelmsford through to Pakenham . Roman remains were discovered in a gravel pit in 1828 , a site now occupied by the village 's football club . The Manor of Melford was given to the Abbey of St. Edmundsbury by Earl Aflric in ca . 1050 . The village is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 which lists the manor of Long Melford as an estate of 600 hectares . The neighbouring Manor of Kentwell is also recorded . Following the dissolution of the Monasteries , Henry VIII granted the manor to Sir William Cordell . Long Melford is fairly unusual for a village in that it has a parish church of dimensions more suited to a cathedral . Originally completed in 1484 , Holy Trinity Church is the one of the richest `` wool churches '' in East Anglia and is renowned for its flushwork , The Clopton chantry chapel and the Lady Chapel at the East end with some surviving medieval stained-glass . Edmund Blunden , the World War I poet , is buried in the churchyard . Next to the church is the Hospital of the Holy and Blessed Trinity , an almshouse founded by William Cordell in 1573 . Another unusual feature of Long Melford is its large elongated village green , dominated until the 1980s by a group of great elms that included one of the largest in England . The elms were painted in 1940 by the watercolourist S. R. Badmin in his ` Long Melford Green on a Frosty Morning ' , now in the Victoria and Albert Museum . The village contains two stately homes , Kentwell Hall and Melford Hall , all built from the proceeds of the wool trade in the Middle Ages . Kentwell Hall and the Holy Trinity Church were financed by the Clopton family , in particular by John Clopton . Long Melford once had a railway station on the Stour Valley Line , but this closed in March 1967 when the line was cut back to Sudbury .
Year 1557 ( MDLVII ) was a common year starting on Friday ( link will display the full calendar ) of the Julian calendar .

Produce is a generalized term for a group of farm-produced goods and , not limited to fruits and vegetables ( i.e. meats , grains , oats , etc. ) . More specifically , the term `` produce '' often implies that the products are fresh and generally in the same state as where they were harvested . In supermarkets the term is also used to refer to the section where fruit and vegetables are kept . Produce is the main product sold by greengrocers , farmers ' markets , and fruit markets . In some parts of the world , including the United States , produce is marked with small stickers bearing Price Look-Up codes . These four or five digit codes are a standardized system intended to aid checkout and inventory control in produce markets . Although in the United States most produce is available year-round , produce is at its best and cheapest in the season it is harvested . Seasonality of produce depends on the region . Below is a general list of seasonality for United States produce . Spring fruits are apricots , pineapple , strawberries , and mango . Spring vegetables are peas ( sugar snap and snow ) and more delicate cabbages including mustard greens , baby lettuce , baby spinach and watercress . Also in season are artichoke , asparagus , avocado , new potatoes , rhubarb . Summer fruits include some berries ( blackberries , blueberries , raspberries ) and stone fruit ( nectarines , peaches , and plums ) as well as melons . Summer vegetables include beets , corn , cucumber , eggplant , green beans , tomatoes and zucchini . Autumn fruits includes apples , grapes , figs , pears , and pomegranates . Autumn vegetables include many cultivars of wild cabbage ( broccoli , Brussels sprouts , cauliflower , collards , endives , and kale ) . Root vegetables ( garlic , ginger , parsnips , turnips and yams ) and winter squash ( acorn squash , butternut squash and pumpkins ) are also in season . Corn is in season and peas , seasonal in spring , are also seasonal in late autumn . Winter fruits include citrus ( clementines , grapefruit , oranges , and lemons ) and pomegranates . Winter vegetables include hardier cabbages ( kale , leeks , radicchio , and Brussels sprout ) . Also seasonal in winter are some root vegetables ( rutabaga , turnips , and radishes ) as well as winter squash . Some produce , such as onions , lettuce and spinach , are seasonal year-round in some places .
Thallium ( I ) bromide ( TlBr ) , a chemical compound , available in an ultra-pure state is a compound semiconductor ; used in room temperature X - and gamma-ray detectors and blue sensitive photodetectors ; used as a real-time x-ray image sensor ; also used as a standard for elemental thallium . The crystalline structure is of cubic CsCl type at room temperature , but it lowers to the orthorombic thallium iodide type upon cooling , the transition temperature being likely affected by the impurities . A Material safety data sheet ( MSDS ) is available at http://www.espimetals.com/msds's/thalliumbromide.pdf . Thallium is extremely toxic and a cumulative poison which can be absorbed through the skin . Acute and chronic effects include fatigue , limb pain , peripheral neuritis , joint pain , loss of hair , Central nervous System effects , diarrhea , vomiting , liver and kidney damage .
The hypochlorite ion , also known as chlorate ( I ) anion is ClOâ ' . A hypochlorite compound is a chemical compound containing this group , with chlorine in oxidation state +1 . Hypochlorites are the salts of hypochlorous acid . Common examples include sodium hypochlorite ( chlorine bleach or bleaching agent ) and calcium hypochlorite ( bleaching powder or swimming pool chlorination compound ) . Hypochlorites are frequently quite unstable â '' for example , sodium hypochlorite is not available as a solid , since removal of the water from NaClO solution converts it to a mixture of sodium chloride and sodium chlorate . Heating of NaClO solution also causes this reaction . Hypochlorites decompose in sunlight , giving chlorides and oxygen . Due to their low stability , hypochlorites are very strong oxidizing agents . They react with many organic and inorganic compounds . Reaction with organic compounds is very exothermic and may cause ignition , so hypochlorites should be handled with care . They can oxidize manganese compounds , converting them to permanganates . Covalent hypochlorites , such as methyl hypochlorite are also known , and are typically unstable . Hypochlorites generate chlorine gas when mixed with dilute acids . Hypochlorite and chloride are in equilibrium with chlorine gas : Therefore , by Le Chatelier 's principle , a high pH drives the reaction to the left by consuming ions , promoting the disproportionation of chlorine into chloride and hypochlorite , whereas a low pH drives the reaction to the right , promoting the release of chlorine gas . Hypochlorites are used as bleaches to remove dyes . Hypochlorite is the strongest oxidising agent of the generalized chlorates ; . For example , it oxidises to permanganate : Hypochlorite is the least stable of the chlorine oxyanions . Many hypochlorite compounds exist only in solution , as is also the case with hypochlorous acid ( HClO ) itself . Hypochlorite is unstable with respect to disproportionation . Upon heating , it degrades to a mixture of chloride , oxygen and other chlorates :
Varanidae is a group of lizards of the superfamily Varanoidea . The family is a group of carnivorous lizards which includes the largest living lizard , the Komodo dragon , and the crocodile monitor . Varanidae contains the living genus Varanus and a number of extinct taxa . Their closest living relatives are the anguid and helodermatid lizards . Monitor lizards are reputed to be among the most intelligent lizards . Most species forage widely and have large home ranges , and many have high stamina . Although carnivorous , at least one species is known to consume fruit . Among species of living varanids , the limbs show positive allometry , being larger in larger-bodied species , although the feet become smaller as compared with the lengths of the other limb segments .
A somatic cell ( diploid ) is any biological cell forming the body of an organism ; that is , in a multicellular organism , any cell other than a gamete , germ cell , gametocyte or undifferentiated stem cell . By contrast , gametes are cells that fuse during sexual reproduction , for organisms that reproduce sexually ; Germ cells are cells that give rise to gametes ; Stem cells are cells that can divide through mitosis and differentiate into diverse specialized cell types . For example , in mammals , somatic cells make up all the internal organs , skin , bones , blood , and connective tissue . By contrast , mammalian germ cells give rise to spermatozoa and ova which fuse during fertilization to produce a cell called a zygote , which develops into an embryo . The word `` somatic '' is derived from the Greek word sÅ ma , meaning `` body '' . Like all cells , somatic cells contain DNA arranged in chromosomes . If a somatic cell contains chromosomes arranged in pairs , it is called diploid an the organism is called a diploid organism . ( The gametes of diploid organisms contain only single unpaired chromosomes and are called haploid . ) Each pair of chromosomes comprises one chromosome inherited from the father and one inherited from the mother . For example , in humans , somatic cells contain 46 chromosomes organized into 23 pairs . By contrast , gametes of diploid organisms contain only half as many chromosomes . In humans , this is 23 unpaired chromosomes . When two gametes ( i.e. a spermatozoon and an ovum ) meet during conception , they fuse together , creating a zygote . Due to the fusion of the two gametes , a human zygote contains 46 chromosomes ( i.e. 23 pairs ) . However , a large number of species have the chromosomes in their somatic cells arranged in fours ( `` tetraploid '' ) or even sixes ( `` hexaploid '' ) . Thus , they can have diploid or even triploid germline cells . An example of this is the modern cultivated species of wheat , Triticum Aestivum L. , a hexaploid species whose somatic cells contain six copies of every chromatid . In recent years , the technique of cloning whole organisms has been developed in mammals , allowing almost identical genetic clones of an animal to be produced . One method of doing this is called `` somatic cell nuclear transfer '' and involves removing the nucleus from a somatic cell , usually a skin cell . This nucleus contains all of the genetic information needed to produce the organism it was removed from . This nucleus is then injected into an ovum of the same species which has had its own genetic material removed . The ovum now no longer needs to be fertilized , because it contains the correct amount of genetic material ( a diploid number of chromosomes ) . In theory , the ovum can be implanted into the uterus of a same-species animal and allowed to develop . The resulting animal will be a nearly genetically identical clone to the animal from which the nucleus was taken . The only difference is caused by any mitochondrial DNA is retained in the ovum , which is different than the cell that donated the nucleus . In practice , this technique has so far been problematic , although there have been a few high profile successes , such as Dolly the Sheep and , more recently , Snuppy , the first cloned dog .
A userbox ( commonly abbreviated as UBX ) is a small colored box ( see examples to the right ) designed to appear only on a Wikipedian 's user page as a communicative notice about the user , in order to directly ( or even indirectly ) help Wikipedians collaborate more effectively on articles . The first userboxes were introduced to support the Babel inter-language effort , to indicate users ' skills in other languages .

On January 1 , 2006 Boechout had a total population of 12,090 . The total area is 20.66 kmÂ which gives a population density of 585 inhabitants per kmÂ . Boechout also hosts the Sfinks Festival .
The 2024 Summer Olympics , which will be officially known as the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad if the present naming convention and frequency is unchanged , are an international athletic event that might be organized by the International Olympic Committee . The winning bid should be announced in 2017 . Durban is planning on bidding for the 2020 Summer Olympics . If Durban does not win the bid , there is a possibility that they will bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics . Taiwan 's capital and largest city may put in a bid in accordance with a campaign promise made by now-president Ma Ying-jeou while he was running for president in 2008 . It is seen as the culmination of a build-up in hosting sporting events for Taipei and the rest of Taiwan . Taipei hosted the 2009 Deaflympics while Kaohsiung hosted the 2009 World Games . The French capital was unsuccessful in vying to be the host city for the 1992 , 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games . The year 2024 will mark the 100th anniversary of the 1924 Summer Olympics held in Paris . The former French Minister of Sports , Jean-Francois Lamour , had made it clear that 2024 represents a choice objective for a Parisian bid . â 35 million will be planned to build new sports venues around Paris in order to improve quality of the future Parisian bid . The organization of the Games in Copenhagen has proposed a joint bid in the Oresund Region and is investigated by the Danish government . A cooperation with MalmÃ and other cities in the region has been proposed . MalmÃ politicians are positive to the idea of arranging Olympics together with the neighboring country , Denmark . If the Oresund Region bids and wins , it will be the first Olympics organized by two different countries at the same time . Several multi-national bids have been made before , but not been accepted by the IOC . The Dutch city of Amsterdam showed interest to bid for the Games . Amsterdam is noted for hosting the 1928 Summer Olympics . Madrid is planning a bid for the 2024 , or the 2020 Summer Olympics . The city bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics but was defeated by Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . Ukrainian Vice-Prime Minister , Borys Kolesnikov , stated that in the case that Ukraine successfully co-hosts the Euro 2012 with Poland , it may potentially place a bid for hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics . Ukraine is also planning a bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics . On July 10 , 2007 it was revealed that the Canadian Olympic Committee had begun work on a potential bid for the 2020 or 2024 games for Toronto , the capital of Ontario and largest city in Canada . This would be Toronto 's third bid for the summer Olympic games , after unsuccessful bids for the 1996 and 2008 games , but a successful bid for the 2015 Pan American Games . Larry Needle , executive director of the Philadelphia Sports Congress , said that if Philadelphia , the largest city in Pennsylvania , wants to host the Olympics , its earliest realistic chance would be the 2024 Summer Games . A study by eleven graduate students from the University of Pennsylvania showed that Philadelphia should consider bidding for the 2024 Olympics . The study said that one of the city 's biggest challenges would be convincing the voters who select the host city that Philadelphia is a `` world-class city '' , something that `` will require strategic changes in the cityâ s landscape in conjunction with a persuasive marketing strategy '' . : Brisbane has been pre-selected by the Australian Olympic Committee as a likely Australian bid city . The bid has been endorsed by Queensland Premier Anna Bligh and Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman . The President of the IOC Jacques Rogge has also mentioned that Brisbane would have a high chance of receiving the games . Brisbane has hosted several major sporting events including the 1982 Commonwealth Games and the 2001 Goodwill Games . The city also hosted events during the 1987 Rugby World Cup , 1992 Cricket World Cup , 2000 Sydney Olympics , the 2003 Rugby World Cup and hosted the Final of the 2008 Rugby League World Cup . The city previously bid for the 1992 Olympics , coming 3rd to Barcelona and Paris . This bid also coincides with a bid for Brisbane to host the 2020 World Expo and a possible 2018 Youth Olympics Bid . : Melbourne is considering a bid for either the 2024 or 2028 Summer Olympics . The only major venue that would need to be constructed would be a rowing and canoeing course . The city hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics and the 2006 Commonwealth Games . It already has the infrastructure in place to host such an event . President of the Peruvian Institute for Sports , Arturo Woodman , said that Peru would try to bid for the 2024 Summer Olympic Games , although the games being held in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 might pose a challenge as the IOC will view it as too recent for a South American return .
National Assembly is either a legislature , or the lower house of a bicameral legislature in some countries . The best known National Assembly , and the first legislature to be known by this title , was that established during the French Revolution in 1789 , known as the AssemblÃ e nationale . Consequently , the name is particularly common in Francophone countries , but is also found in some Commonwealth countries . In Germany , a Nationalversammlung was elected following the revolutions of 1848-1849 and 1918-1919 , to be replaced by a permanent parliament ( Reichstag ) later . The legislature of the Estado Novo regime in Portugal was dubbed National Assembly , while the Corporative Assembly was a purely advisory chamber . It was also the name of the legislature during France 's First Republic and the Consulate , and since 1946 has been the lower house of the French parliament , first under the Fourth Republic , and from 1958 , the Fifth Republic .
A Rube Goldberg machine , device , or apparatus is a deliberately over-engineered machine that performs a very simple task in a very complex fashion , usually including a chain reaction . The expression is named after American cartoonist and inventor Rube Goldberg . Since then , the expression has expanded to denote any form of overly confusing or complicated system . For example , news headlines include `` Is Rep. Bill Thomas the Rube Goldberg of Legislative Reform ? '' and `` Retirement ` insurance ' as a Rube Goldberg machine '' . Rube Goldberg 's cartoons became well known for depicting complex devices that performed simple tasks in indirect , convoluted ways . An example on the right is Goldberg 's `` Professor Butts and the Self-Operating Napkin '' , which was later reprinted in the postcard book , Rube Goldberg 's Inventions ! , compiled by Maynard Frank Wolfe from the Rube Goldberg Archives . The `` Self-Operating Napkin '' is activated when the soup spoon ( A ) is raised to mouth , pulling string ( B ) and thereby jerking ladle ( C ) which throws cracker ( D ) past parrot ( E ) . Parrot jumps after cracker and perch ( F ) tilts , upsetting seeds ( G ) into pail ( H ) . Extra weight in pail pulls cord ( I ) , which opens and lights automatic cigar lighter ( J ) , setting off skyrocket ( K ) which causes sickle ( L ) to cut string ( M ) and allow pendulum with attached napkin to swing back and forth , thereby wiping chin . In 1931 , the Merriamâ `` Webster dictionary adopted the word `` Rube Goldberg '' as an adjective defined as accomplishing something simple through complex means . In early 1987 , Purdue University in Indiana started the annual National Rube Goldberg Machine Contest , organized by the Phi Chapter of Theta Tau , a national engineering fraternity .
Mateja KeÅ 3\/4 man ( Serbian Cyrillic : Ð Ð Ñ Ð Ñ Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð 1\/4 Ð Ð 1\/2 ; born 12 April 1979 in Belgrade ) is a Serbian footballer currently playing for Hong Kong First Division League side South China . KeÅ 3\/4 man made his name at Partizan in his homeland before moving to Dutch side PSV Eindhoven for â 8 million in 2000 . In his debut season , he was the top scorer in the Dutch Eredivisie , scoring 24 goals in 33 games . He also picked up the nickname ` Batman ' because the famous theme song was played at the Philips Stadion every time he scored . KeÅ 3\/4 man and Arjen Robben gained the epithet ` Batman and Robben ' , a pun on ` Batman and Robin ' . KeÅ 3\/4 man went on to score 81 goals over the following three seasons with PSV , achieving the record as the first Dutch league player to score more league goals than games played in consecutive seasons , before finally moving for Â # 5.3 million to English side Chelsea in the summer of 2004 . Although he scored the winning goal in the 2005 Carling Cup final against Liverpool ( with Chelsea winning 3 â `` 2 after extra time ) , he failed to make an impact with the London club and started only 14 games . He left for AtlÃ tico Madrid after just one season with Chelsea who made a minor profit on his transfer . After a short spell in Madrid , he moved once again to FenerbahÃ e for $ 9.75 m in August 2006 on a four year contract . He won the Turkish Super League with FenerbahÃ e in their centennial year . On 19 August 2008 , KeÅ 3\/4 man agreed to join Paris Saint-Germain on loan with a purchase option of â 4 million plus â 1 million that KeÅ 3\/4 man himself had to pay to FenerbahÃ e upon leaving . On 30 August 2009 , Zenit Saint Petersburg loaned the striker from Paris Saint-Germain for free with a purchase option for an undisclosed fee . He scored two goals for Zenit helping the team to finish 3rd in the Russian Premier League , but the Russian side decided not to retain his services . On 20 January 2011 , South China announced that KeÅ 3\/4 man has signed to play for the club for the rest of the 2010 â `` 11 Hong Kong First Division League and the 2011 AFC Cup . KeÅ 3\/4 man made his debut on 29 January 2011 versus NT Realty Wofoo Tai Po which lost 1 â `` 0 , KeÅ 3\/4 man was substituted by Leung Chun Pong at the 63th minute . On 13 February 2011 , on the League Cup semi-final against league leader Kitchee , he scored his first goal in South China on the 32nd minute and his second goal after 83 minutes . South China beat Kitchee by 4-2 and entered the finals . KeÅ 3\/4 man marked his international debut for FR Yugoslavia during March 2000 just short of his 21st birthday with a goal against China in a friendly match as part of the preparations for UEFA Euro 2000 . Head coach Vujadin BoÅ kov included him in the final 23-man roster that he took to Belgium and Holland . Despite being the fourth attacking option behind Savo MiloÅ eviÄ , Darko KovaÄ eviÄ and Predrag MijatoviÄ , 21-year-old KeÅ 3\/4 man got his chance as substitute late in the group match versus Norway . However , after being on the pitch for about 90 seconds , he was sent off following a rash tackle on Erik Mykland . Right after Euro 2000 , FR Yugoslavia got a new head coach Ilija PetkoviÄ under whose tenure KeÅ 3\/4 man secured a place in the team . KeÅ 3\/4 man led Serbia and Montenegro 's scoring during the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifications with 5 goals , including the only goal in the final game against Bosnia and Herzegovina which in turn allowed Serbia and Montenegro to qualify directly , having come first in their group . During the competition , he was sent off in a group match against Argentina by referee Roberto Rosetti . Despite being such a prolific striker for PSV he never reached the same heights for Serbia . He has managed 17 goals in 49 caps for Serbia and Montenegro . Since his sending off against Argentina in the 2006 FIFA World Cup , he has not been called up to any of Serbia 's friendlies nor did he participate in any of the qualification games for the UEFA Euro 2008 .
Secondary sex characteristics are features that distinguish the two sexes of a species , but that are not directly part of the reproductive system . They are believed to be the product of sexual selection for traits which give an individual an advantage over its rivals in courtship and aggressive interactions . They are distinguished from the primary sex characteristics : the sex organs , which are directly necessary for reproduction to occur . Well known secondary sex characteristics include manes of male lions and long feathers of male peacocks . Other dramatic examples include the tusks of male narwhals , enlarged proboscises in male elephant seals and proboscis monkeys , the bright facial and rump coloration of male mandrills , and horns in many goats and antelopes . Male birds and fish of many species have brighter coloration or other external ornaments . Differences in size between sexes are also considered secondary sexual characteristics . In humans , visible secondary sex characteristics include enlarged breasts of females and facial hair on males . Charles Darwin hypothesized that sexual selection , or competition within a species for mates , can explain observed differences between sexes in many species . Biologists today distinguish between `` male to male combat '' and `` mate choice '' , usually female choice of male mates . Sexual characteristics due to combat are such things as antlers , horns and greater size . Characteristics due to mate choice , often referred to as ornaments , include brighter plumage , coloration and other features that have no immediate purpose for survival or combat . Ornamentation might arise because of some arbitrary female preference that is initially amplified by random genetic drift , eventually being reinforced by active selection for males with the appropriate ornament . This is known as the sexy son hypothesis . An alternative hypothesis is that some of the genes that enable males to develop impressive ornaments or fighting ability may be correlated with fitness markers such as disease resistance or a more efficient metabolism . This idea is known as the good genes hypothesis . Sexual differentiation begins during gestation , when the gonads are formed . General habitus and shape of body and face , as well as sex hormone levels , are similar in prepubertal boys and girls . As puberty progresses and sex hormone levels rise , differences appear , though puberty causes some similar changes in male and female bodies . Male levels of testosterone directly induce growth of the testicles and penis , and indirectly ( via dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) ) the prostate . Estradiol and other hormones cause breasts to develop in females . However , fetal or neonatal androgens may modulate later breast development by reducing the capacity of breast tissue to respond to later estrogen . In males , testosterone directly increases size and mass of muscles , vocal cords , and bones , deepening the voice , and changing the shape of the face and skeleton . Converted into DHT in the skin , it accelerates growth of androgen-responsive facial and body hair , but may slow and eventually stop the growth of head hair . Taller stature is largely a result of later puberty and slower epiphyseal fusion . In females , breasts are a manifestation of higher levels of estrogen ; estrogen also widens the pelvis and increases the amount of body fat in hips , thighs , buttocks , and breasts . Estrogen also induces growth of the uterus , proliferation of the endometrium , menses , and makes the skin clearer and gives it a pink to red hue ( increases pheomelanin , reduces eumelanin ) .
Delta is a district municipality in British Columbia , and forms part of Metro Vancouver . Located south of Richmond , it is bordered by the Fraser River to the north , the United States ( Point Roberts , Washington ) to the south and the city of Surrey to the east . Delta is composed of three distinct communities : Ladner , Tsawwassen , and North Delta . Prior to European settlement , Delta 's flatlands and coastal shores were inhabited by the Tsawwassen indigenous peoples , of the Coast Salish First Nations . The land was first sighted by Europeans in 1791 , when Spanish explorer Lieutenant Francisco de Eliza mistook the area for an island and named it `` Isla Capeda '' . The first Europeans to settle in the area were Thomas and William Ladner , who began farming the area in 1868 . Farming and fishing helped the community grow quickly over the next few decades . In 1879 , the area was incorporated to become `` Delta '' , and the village of Ladner was made as its administrative center . Due to its geography , Delta was a relatively isolated community . The completion of the George Massey Tunnel in 1959 linking Ladner to Richmond and Vancouver along with the opening , in 1960 , of the Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal and the Highway 99 being rerouted from the King George Highway in Surrey in 1962 to a new route through Delta , ended Delta 's isolation and resulted in a massive 400 % population growth over the next 20 years . The 1986 completion of the Alex Fraser Bridge connecting North Delta to New Westminster and Vancouver also helped Delta 's growth . As of 2005 , Delta 's population was 102,655 . About 23 % of Delta 's population are visible minorities , of which there are approximately 12,000 South Asians and 5,400 Chinese Canadians . There are also about 1,400 Aboriginal peoples , some from the Tsawwassen Indian band , who still hold traditional lands on the Tsawwassen Indian Reserve as well as the Hwlitsum First Nation , at the mouth of the Fraser River . Delta is located 27 k south of Vancouver and 22 k north of the U.S. border at Peace Arch , Surrey . It is bordered by water on three sides : The Fraser River to the north , the Georgia Strait to the west and Boundary Bay to the south . At 364 k , Delta is the largest municipality in the GVRD ; the second largest is its neighbor to the east , Surrey , at 317.4 k. Delta 's flat , fertile land has made it one of the most important agricultural areas in Metro Vancouver . The Agricultural Land Reserve regulations preserve most of this land for agricultural use , preventing its conversion to suburban housing . North Delta is also home to the Burns Bog , 40 square kilometres ( 10,000 acres ) of natural wetlands that are important for wildlife . Delta is governed by the Delta Municipal Council , led by a Mayor and six Councillors . They are elected for three-year terms , the last elections being held in November 2008 . The current mayor is Lois Jackson . Unlike most communities in Canada , but like Vancouver and Richmond , Delta has a system of loosely organized , locally based political parties such as Jackson 's TriDelta . Delta 's rural-urban split is reflected in its politics , with urbanized North Delta voting more to the left , while rural western areas of Delta have voted more conservative . For example , in the 2005 elections to the British Columbia Legislature , the North Delta seat went to the New Democratic Party , while the other seat went to the BC Liberal Party . Likewise , in the Canadian House of Commons , one of Delta 's two seats is held by the Conservative Party while the other is held by the Liberal Party of Canada . Delta , unlike most Lower Mainland municipalities , has its own police department . In Delta is the Arnott Substation ( ART ) , the mainland terminal of the HVDC Vancouver Island circuit . Delta has many minor sports teams in hockey , baseball , and lacrosse . Over 160 young people play ringette in Delta . The Delta Ringette Association has 13 teams in 2005 . Notable professional sports players from Delta are Jeff Francis ( MLB ) , Justin Morneau ( MLB ) , Brent Seabrook ( NHL ) , Troy Brouwer ( NHL ) and Mitch Berger ( NFL ) . Delta 's unique and varying terrain provides a challenging test for many of the world 's best cyclists in the Tour de Delta . Since its first event in 2001 , the Tour de Delta has grown to be Canada 's largest cycling event . The Vancouver Whitecaps have also committed to building a training center in East Delta in 2010 .

Brian Leslie Labone ( 23 January 1940 -- 24 April 2006 ) was an English footballer who played for and captained Everton . A one-club man , Labone 's professional career lasted from 1958 to 1971 , during which he won the Football League championship twice and the FA Cup once . He also played 26 times for the England national football team . Liverpool-born Labone chose to join Everton at 17 in July 1957 instead of going to university . His debut for the first team was in 1958 . He was widely regarded as one of the best central defenders of his era . He was a strong tackler , good in the air , adequately fast but he rarely used his left foot . Labone made 451 League appearances for Everton and a total of 534 in all competitions . He scored two league goals and was booked only twice throughout his career . Labone played in the championship teams of 1962-63 and 1969-70 , in the FA Cup winning team of 1966 , and in the FA Cup final of 1968 . Brian showed his high opinion of Everton in a simple quote `` One Evertonian is worth twenty Liverpudlians '' Labone played 26 times for England between 1962 and 1970 . He withdrew from England 's 1966 World Cup squad because of his imminent marriage but played in three of the four games in the World Cup in 1970 in Mexico . In 1970-71 Labone sustained a serious injury to his Achilles tendon and retired from playing . Labone maintained his links with Everton where he worked as a guide for guests & visitors and a website columnist . Labone was included in Everton 's ` Greatest Ever Team ' as voted for by the fans at the start of the 2003\/2004 season to mark the clubs 125th anniversary . Whilst returning home from an Everton fans awards evening at The Winslow Hotel in Walton , Labone died suddenly after collapsing in the street close to his Lydiate home at the age of 66 . Another former Everton captain , Kevin Ratcliffe , paid the following tribute : `` Brian was Everton . If you could put together a team of every player that has ever captained Everton , every one of us would turn to Brian to lead us out . He will always be known as the captain of Everton '' . Everton Chairman Bill Kenwright also paid tribute by saying : `` On the foot of the Dixie Dean statue outside Goodison Park are the words `` Footballer - Gentlemen - Evertonian '' ... ... those words summed up Dixie - and they apply , equally , to the great Brian Labone . '' Part of Everton 's home ground , Goodison Park , was named in his honor .

Sorry . Do n't fall asleep zzzzzz 10:14 , 9 September 2008 ( UTC ) Poprad is a city in northern Slovakia at the foot of the High Tatra Mountains famous for its picturesque historic center and as a holiday resort . It is the biggest town of the SpiÅ region and the tenth largest city in Slovakia with a population of approximately 55,000 . The Poprad-Tatry Airport is an international airport located just outside the city . Poprad is also the starting point of the Tatra Electric Railway ( known in Slovak as TatranskÃ elektrickÃ Å 3\/4 eleznica ) , a set of special narrow-gauge trains ( trams ) connecting the resorts in the High Tatras with each other and with Poprad . Main line trains link Poprad to other destinations in Slovakia and beyond ; in particular , there are through trains running from Poprad to Prague in the Czech Republic . The territory belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary since the 10th century and was probably originally inhabited by Slavic settlers . It was colonized in the 13th century by German settlers and became the largely German town Deutschendorf meaning ` German village ' . From 1412 to 1770 , as one of the Szepes towns , Poprad was pawned by the Kingdom of Hungary to the Kingdom of Poland , resulting in a strong Polish influence on the city 's further development . Poprad itself , the first written reference to which dates from 1256 , was for 690 years ( up until 1946 ) just one of several neighbouring settlements , which currently make up the modern city . The other parts of the current municipality are Matejovce ( first reference 1251 ) , SpiÅ skÃ Sobota ( 1256 ) , VeÄ 3\/4 kÃ ( 1268 ) , and StrÃ Å 3\/4 e pod Tatrami ( 1276 ) . The most significant of these original towns was Georgenberg ( or Szepesszombat , now : SpiÅ skÃ Sobota ) , which preserved its dominant position in the area until the late 19th century . In 1999 , Poprad put in a bid to host the 2006 Winter Olympics , but lost to Turin , Italy . Poprad lies at an altitude of 672 m above sea level and covers an area of 63 k. It is located in northeastern Slovakia , about 110 k from KoÅ ice and 330 k from Bratislava ( by road ) . Poprad is situated on the Poprad River in the Sub-Tatra Basin , and is a gateway to the High Tatras . Mountain ranges around the city include the LevoÄ a Hills in the east , Kozie chrbty in the south , and the Low Tatras in the southwest . The drainage divide between the Black Sea and Baltic Sea lies a bit to the west , near the village of Å trba . Poprad lies in the north temperate zone and has a humid continental climate ( KÃ ppen Dfb ) with four distinct seasons . It is characterized by a significant variation between warm summers and cold winters . Poprad has a population of 55,158 ( as of December 31 , 2005 ) . According to the 2001 census , 94.1 % of inhabitants were Slovaks , 2.1 % Roma , 1 % Czechs , 0.2 % Hungarians , 0.2 % Germans , 0.1 % Rusyns , 0.1 % Ukrainians , and 0.1 % Poles . The religious make-up was 65.9 % Roman Catholics , 16.8 % people with no religious affiliation , and 7.3 % Lutherans . The historical center is concentrated around the St. Egidius square ( NÃ mestie svÃ tÃ ho EgÃ dia ) , which is rimmed with houses predominantly from the 18th and 19th centuries . Churches in the city include the early-Gothic Catholic Church of St. Egidius from the late 13th century . Another historical center near Poprad is in SpiÅ skÃ Sobota , which was declared in 1953 to be a Town Monument Reserve . A significant landmark there is the Church of St. George , with five late-Gothic side altars and a main altar from the workshop of Master Paul of LevoÄ a. Modern places of interest include a new water park called AquaCity Poprad . Since 2003 , the mayor is Anton Danko ( former international ice-hockey referee ) . The city 's system of primary education consists of 12 public schools , and one religious primary school , enrolling in total 5,464 pupils . Secondary education is represented by four gymnasia with 1,800 students , three specialized high schools with 1,566 students , and four vocational schools with 2,045 students ( data as of 2007 ) . Poprad is a gateway of the High Tatra mountain range , which is a popular tourist destination . The city lies on the main road ( E 50 ) and railway connecting western and eastern Slovakia .
Pentti Alexander Lund ( born December 6 , 1925 in Karijoki , Finland ) is a retired Finnish-Canadian professional ice hockey right winger who played for the Boston Bruins and New York Rangers in the National Hockey League . He was also the recipient of the Calder Trophy in 1949 . Lund is often credited as being the first Finnish player in the National Hockey League . ( Albert Pudas , however , played 4 games with the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1926-1927 ) . Lund moved to Canada from Finland at the age of six . Lund began his junior career with the Port Arthur Bruins and the Port Arthur Navy team from 1942 to 1945 . Lund lead the league in scoring during his two seasons with the Navy team , where , in 19 regular season games , he scored an impressive 47 goals . Lund would turn pro in 1945 â `` 46 with the Boston Olympics of the EAHL , again , leading the league in scoring . In 1947 â `` 48 , Lund joined the Hershey Bears in the AHL where his excellent play was rewarded with two playoff game appearances with the Boston Bruins , thus becoming the first Finnish-born forward to play in the NHL . During the off-season , Lund was traded to the New York Rangers , where he won the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year by scoring 14 goals and adding 16 assists in 59 games . Lund was traded back to Boston in 1951 where he would end his professional career after an eye-injury from a high-stick on November 13 , during the 13th game of the season , with Lund skating with number 13 on his jersey . Lund attempted a comeback after being sidelined for three-months , contributing 17 points with only one eye the following season . Lund would skate for two seasons with an amateur club in Sault Ste . Marie before retiring from hockey in 1955 . On September 29 , 1984 . Lund was inducted into the Northwestern Ontario Sports Hall of Fame , and 8 years later , in 1992 , inducted into the Finnish Ice Hockey Hall of Fame .
A nuclear explosion occurs as a result of the rapid release of energy from an intentionally high-speed nuclear reaction . The driving reaction may be nuclear fission , nuclear fusion or a multistage cascading combination of the two , though to date all fusion based weapons have used a fission device to initiate fusion , and a pure fusion weapon remains a hypothetical device . Atmospheric nuclear explosions are associated with mushroom clouds , although mushroom clouds can occur with large chemical explosions , and it is possible to have an air-burst nuclear explosion without these clouds . Nuclear explosions produce radiation and radioactive debris . In 1963 , the United States , Soviet Union , and United Kingdom signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty , pledging to refrain from testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere , underwater , or in outer space . The treaty permitted underground tests . Many other non-nuclear nations acceded to the Treaty following its entry into force ; however , three nuclear weapons states have not acceded : France , China , and North Korea . The primary application to date has been military ( i.e. nuclear weapons ) . However , there are other potential applications , which have not yet been explored , or have been considered but abandoned . They include Nuclear weapons are largely seen as a ` deterrent ' by most governments ; the sheer scale of the destruction caused by a nuclear weapon has prevented much serious consideration of their use in warfare . In the history of warfare , two nuclear weapons have been detonatedâ '' both by the U.S. in World War II . The first event occurred on the morning of 6 August 1945 , when the United States dropped a uranium gun-type device code-named `` Little Boy '' on the Japanese city of Hiroshima . The second event occurred three days later when , again , the United States dropped a plutonium implosion-type device code-named `` Fat Man '' on the city of Nagasaki . These bombings resulted in the immediate deaths of around 120,000 people and more over time , because of the nuclear radiation . The use of these weapons was and remains controversial . ( See Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for a full discussion ) . Nuclear tests are experiments carried out to determine the effectiveness , yield and explosive capability of nuclear weapons . Throughout the twentieth century , most nations that have developed nuclear weapons have staged tests of them . Testing nuclear weapons can yield information about how the weapons work , as well as how the weapons behave under various conditions and how structures behave when subjected to nuclear explosions . Additionally , nuclear testing has often been used as an indicator of scientific and military strength , and many tests have been overtly political in their intention ; most nuclear weapons states publicly declared their nuclear status by means of a nuclear test . The dominant effects of a nuclear weapon ( the blast and thermal radiation ) are the same physical damage mechanisms as conventional explosives , but the energy produced by a nuclear explosive is millions of times more per gram and the temperatures reached are in the tens of megakelvins . Nuclear weapons are quite different from regular weapons because of the huge amount of explosive energy they can put out and the different kinds of effects they make , like high temperatures and nuclear radiation . The devastating impact of the explosion does not stop after the initial blast , as with regular explosives . A cloud of nuclear radiation travels from the epicenter of the explosion , causing an impact to lifeforms even after the heat waves have ceased . The radiation can cause genetic mutation , radiation poisoning , and death .

The film follows the life of a minister and his family and the various difficulties and people they encounter as they move from parish to parish . Minister Spence starts with a strict religious view of ministry but grows to appreciate the life of a younger generation and how he needs to minister to people , and not just going through rituals and customs .
The Venezuelan Sylph ( Aglaiocercus berlepschi ) is a small bird in the hummingbird family , Trochilidae . It is restricted to a small area of north-eastern Venezuela and is classed as an endangered species by BirdLife International . It is sometimes considered to be a subspecies of the Long-tailed Sylph ( A. kingi ) . The male is 22 centimetres in length with the elongated outer tail-feathers accounting for 14-15 centimetres . Its plumage is mostly irridescent green . The throat is blue and the outer tail-feathers are violet , becoming blue towards the tips . The female is 9.5-11 centimetres long . The tail is shorter than that of the male but still fairly long and slightly forked . Females have a blue crown and white throat , breast and belly . The Long-tailed Sylph is similar in appearance but does not overlap in range . Males of the subspecies caudatus have a mostly blue tail and no blue throat patch while males of the subspecies margarethae have green tips to the tail-feathers . Females have a rufous breast and belly . The Venezuelan Sylph occurs in Sucre , Monagas and AnzoÃ tegui states . It is found in the Cordillera de Caripe and Cerro Negro and there are unconfirmed reports from the Paria Peninsula . It inhabits forest and scrubland on coastal mountain slopes from 1,450 to 1,800 metres above sea-level . It is threatened by the loss and degradation of its habitat .

Uncle Daddy is a young adult novel written by Ralph Fletcher , first published in 2001 . It was awarded a Christopher Medal in the Books for Young People , ages 10 â `` 12 category in 2002 . River 's father abandoned his wife and son when the son is three years old , he goes out to get a pizza and does not come back . His mother 's uncle moves in and becomes `` Uncle Daddy '' . Rivers is living a fairly typical life for a nine year old boy when his father returns after a six year absence . The return of Rivers father threatens to tear the family apart until Uncle Daddy suffers a near fatal heart attack . Rivers and his parents come together to support Uncle Daddy . Roger Sutton in his review for Horn Book Magazine said that `` Rivers 's narration is open and vulnerable , and readers will feel a ready empathy , not to mention a wish for an Uncle Daddy of their own . '' Heide Piehler said in her review for School Library Journal that this novel will `` appeal to readers who want an alternative to the grim realism of much contemporary fiction . '' Carol Otis Hurst in her review for Teaching Pre K-8 said that `` this short novel is a tear-jerker and Uncle Daddy is almost too good to ring true , but the plot survives -- and so does Uncle Daddy . Rivers ' father has some reasons but no excuses for abandoning his family and their anger is realistically presented . '' Nancy Johnson in her review for The Reading Teacher said that `` Ralph Fletcher 's realistic relationship between adults is convincing while the hero status imposed by Rivers on his great-uncle provides a child 's perspective of a relative who went beyond the common familial relationships to provide a safe and secure environment for loved ones . '' Uncle Daddy was awarded a Christopher Medal in the Books for Young People , ages 10 â `` 12 category in 2002 .

Recordings from projection neurons show in some insects strong specialization and discrimination for the odors presented ( especially for the projection neurons of the macroglomeruli , a specialized complex of glomeruli responsible for the pheromones detection ) . Processing beyond this level is not exactly known though some preliminary results are available . A teaspoon , an item of cutlery ( in American English , also called flatware ) , is a small spoon , commonly part of a silverware ( usually silver plated , German silver or now , stainless steel ) place setting , suitable for stirring and sipping the contents of a cup of tea or coffee . Utilitarian versions are used for measuring . Teaspoons with longer handles , such as iced tea spoons , are commonly used also for ice cream desserts or floats . Similar spoons include the tablespoon and the dessert spoon , the latter intermediate in size between a teaspoon and a tablespoon , used in eating dessert and sometimes soup or cereals . Much less common is the coffee spoon , which is a smaller version of the teaspoon . Another teaspoon , called an orange spoon ( in American English : grapefruit spoon ) , tapers to a sharp point or teeth , and is used to separate citrus fruits from their membranes . A bar spoon , equivalent to a teaspoon , is used in measuring ingredients for mixed drinks . The tablespoon is a larger version of the teaspoon , generally with three times its capacity . A container designed to hold extra teaspoons , called a spooner , usually in a set with a covered sugar container , formed a part of Victorian table service . In some countries , a teaspoon full is a unit of volume , especially in cooking recipes and pharmaceutic prescriptions . In English it is abbreviated as t. , ts . , tsp . or tspn . ) , never capitalized , as capitals are customarily reserved for the larger tablespoon ( `` T. '' or `` Tbls . '' or `` Tb . '' ) . In German and Dutch teaspoon is abbreviated TL , for TeelÃ ffel and Theelepel respectively . In the United States one teaspoon is tablespoon , U.S. fl . oz , of a cup , and of a U.S. liquid gallon ( see United States customary units for relative volumes of these other measures ) . This is approximately 5 mL and of a cubic inch . For nutritional labeling purposes on food packages in the U.S. , the teaspoon is , by federal regulations , rounded to precisely 5 mL , per 21CFR101 .9 ( b ) ( 5 ) ( viii ) . Common teaspoons such as bar spoons for measuring ingredients and stirring mixed drinks are often not designed to contain a standard volume . In practice , they may hold anything between 2.5 mL and 6 mL of liquid , so caution must be employed when using a teaspoon to measure a prescribed dose of medicine . For this reason and in order to avoid dispensing errors , special measuring spoons are available that hold exactly 5 mL . If a recipe calls for a level teaspoonful of a dry ingredient ( salt , flour , etc. ) , this refers to an approximately levelled filling of the spoon , producing the same volume as for liquids . A rounded teaspoonful is a larger but less precise measure , produced without levelling the ingredient off nor heaping it as high as possible . A heaping ( American English ) or heaped ( British English ) teaspoonful is a larger inexact measure , equal to the most that can be obtained by scooping the dry ingredient up without levelling it off .
A refugee camp is a temporary settlement built to receive refugees . Hundreds of thousands of people may live in any one single camp . Usually they are built and run by a government , the United Nations , or international organizations , ( such as the Red Cross ) or NGOs . Refugee camps are generally set up in an impromptu fashion and designed to meet basic human needs for only a short time . Some refugee camps are dirty and unhygienic . If the return of refugees is prevented ( often by civil war ) , a humanitarian crisis can result . Some refugee camps have existed for decades and some people can stay in refugee camps for decades , both of which have major implications for human rights . Some grow into permanent settlements and even merge with nearby older communities , such as Ein el-Helweh and Deir al-Balah . People may stay in these camps , receiving emergency food and medical aid , until it is safe to return to their homes . In some cases , often after several years , other countries decide it will never be safe to return these people , and they are resettled in `` third countries , '' away from the border they crossed . Although camps are intended to be temporary , it is possible for camps to remain in place for decades . Palestinian refugee camps have existed for 50 years , while other well-known camps such as Buduburam have hosted populations for over 20 years . Globally , about 17 countries ( Australia , Benin , Brazil , Burkina Faso , Canada , Chile , Denmark , Finland , Iceland , Ireland , Mexico , the Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , Sweden , the United Kingdom , and the United States ) regularly accept `` quota refugees '' from refugee camps . Refugee camps are typically used to describe settlements of people who have escaped war . In recent years , most quota refugees have come from Iran , Afghanistan , Iraq , Liberia , Somalia , and Sudan , which have been in various wars and revolutions , and the former Yugoslavia , due to the Yugoslav wars .

Iron ( III ) nitrate , or ferric nitrate , is the chemical compound with the formula Fe ( NO3 ) 3 . Since it is deliquescent , it is commonly found in its nonahydrate form Fe ( NO3 ) 3 Â 9H2O in which it forms colourless to pale violet crystals . The compound is prepared by treating iron metal or iron oxides with nitric acid . Certain clays impregnated with ferric nitrate have been shown to be useful oxidants in organic synthesis . For example , ferric nitrate on Montmorilloniteâ '' a reagent called `` Clayfen '' â '' has been employed for the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and thiols to disulfides . Ferric nitrate solutions are used by jewelers and metalsmiths to etch silver and silver alloys .
Zob Ahan Football Club is an Iranian football club based in Isfahan , Iran . They compete in the Iran Pro League . The team is sponsored by the Isfahan Steel Company , which also goes by the name Zob Ahan . The club 's main rival is fellow Isfahani team Sepahan , which is also sponsored by the rival steel mill .

The club made its first appearance in the Asian Champions League in 2004 , as the winners of the 2003 Hazfi Cup , but were eliminated in the group stages . Having missed out so narrowly on winning their first-ever domestic league title in the 2008-2009 season , Zobahan were one of the title contenders once again in the 2009\/10 season , never dropping out of the top-four positions throughout the season . However , at the end , they had to settle for second place once again after finishing six points behind their city rivals Sepahan F.C. . They also lost their grip on the Hazfi Cup after a shock 0-2 loss to a second-division side Gostaresh Foolad F.C. in the semi-finals . In the 2010 AFC Champions League Zob Ahan finished first on the group stage that included FC Bunyodkor , Al-Wahda and Al-Ittihad .

30 ( thirty ) is the natural number following 29 and preceding 31 . 30 is the sum of the first four squares , which makes it a square pyramidal number . It is a primorial and is the smallest Giuga number . 30 is the smallest sphenic number , and the smallest of the form where r is a prime greater than 3 . 30 has an aliquot sum of 42 ; the second sphenic number and all sphenic numbers of this form have an aliquot sum 12 greater than themselves . The aliquot sequence of 30 is 16 members long , it comprises ( 30,42,54,66,90,144,259,45,33,15,9,4,3,1,0 ) Thirty has but one number for which it is the aliquot sum the square number 841 . Adding up some subsets of its divisors ( e.g. , 5 , 10 and 15 ) gives 30 , hence 30 is a semiperfect number . 30 is the largest number such that coprimes smaller than itself are also prime . A polygon with thirty sides is called a tricontagon . The icosahedron and the dodecahedron are Platonic solids with 30 edges . The icosidodecahedron is an Archimedean solid with 30 vertices , and the Tutteâ `` Coxeter graph is a symmetric graph with 30 vertices . E8 has Coxeter number 30 . 30 is a Harshad number . Since any group G such that G = pnm , where p does not divide m , has a subgroup of order pn , and 30 is the only number less than 60 that is not either a prime or of the above form , it is the only candidate for the order of a simple group less than 60 that one needs other methods to reject . 30 A.D. , 30 B.C. , 1930 , 2030 , etc.

The Alfa Romeo 147 is a small family car produced by Italian automaker Alfa Romeo from 2000 to 2010 . The 147 was voted European Car of the Year for 2001 , beating the Ford Mondeo and the Toyota Prius . The 147 was launched at the 2000 Turin Motor Show as a replacement for the 145 \/ 146 hatchbacks , and is based on the running gear of the larger 156 saloon . It was available with 1.6 , 2.0 , and 3.2-litre petrol engines and a 1.9-litre diesel engine . The model was in production for ten years , making it one of the oldest small family cars on sale in Europe at the time of its replacement by the Alfa Romeo Giulietta in late May 2010 . However , there is still some export stock left to last into 2011 . The 147 was designed by Walter de ` Silva and Wolfgang Egger . The 147 received considerable praise for its styling on launch , later it was awarded with some styling awards . The entire 147 range was revamped in 2004 , with the exterior styling changed considerably to be more reminiscent of the new 159 and Brera models , and Alfa Romeo Visconti concept car , most notably for its more aggressive look . The 147 achieved a drag coefficient ( Cd ) of 0.32 . The 147 was facelifted in the end of 2004 : new front grille , new headlights , new rear lights and the interior was updated on all models besides the GTA version . Also a new more powerful diesel engine arrived and suspension was also tweaked . In 2006 the 147 1.9 JTD Q2 version was launched , which features a front Torsen limited slip differential . Alfa Romeo presented a new limited edition 147 called Ducati Corse at the 2007 Bologna Motor Show . The car is equipped with 170 P JTD diesel engine and Q2 , a front Torsen limited slip differential . The 147 has been replaced by the new Giulietta in 2010 . The hot hatch 147 GTA model was launched in 2002 . The GTA used a 3.2 V6 engine , produced 250 P and could achieve a top speed of 246 k. It has a widened body ( 15 mm at each side ) to accommodate the 225\/45R17 tyres . Earlier models have 6-speed manual transmissions ; later models use Selespeed . London-based after-market tuner Autodelta has produced a `` bored out '' version of the GTA sporting a 3.7-litre V6 , producing 328 b , and a split-axle differential gear for the front wheels . Autodelta has also made a Rotrex supercharged version producing 400 b. The handling of 147 was praised in some reviews , in spite of criticism regarding the light ( sensitive ) steering , which makes some drivers feel less involved . However , light steering does help during parking maneuvers . Other criticisms of the 147 included a cumbersome gearshift , unsupportive seats and the lack of interior space compared to its rivals . The car became well-known for its engine note , which is unusually mellifluous for a car of its class . The 147 suffers from fairly poor resale value in Great Britain . The 147 GTA and 147 Autodelta GTA have been road tested by Jeremy Clarkson , and featured on television show Top Gear with a power-lap around the track by The Stig . In his review of Autodelta 147 GTA car for The Sunday Times , Clarkson described the acceleration as '' â Ferrari throttle ? Forget it . When you stamp on the accelerator itâ s like youâ ve hit the Millennium Falconâ s hyperdrive . Suddenly all the stars are fluorescent tubes . â '' and the handling as '' ... A corner was coming . And then it was a distant speck in my rear-view mirror . I vaguely remember turning the wheel and I have a dim recollection of being astounded by the grip ... and then the moment was gone . No , really , the damn thing is a barnacle ... '' .

OlivenÃ a is a town situated on a disputed section of the border between Portugal and Spain . OlivenÃ a is claimed by both countries and occupied by Spain . As OlivenÃ a , the town was under Portuguese sovereignty between 1297 ( Treaty of AlcaÃ ices ) and 1801 when it was occupied by force by Spain under the Treaty of Badajozthan legaly retroceded to Portugal by Spain in 1817 when they subscribed Versailles Congress of 1815 - which Sapin never respected . Spain has since occupied and administered the territory ( now split into two municipalities , Olivenza and TÃ liga ) , whilst Portugal invokes the self-revocation of the Treaty of Badajoz , plus the Treaty of Vienna of 1815 , to claim the return of the territory . The territorial dispute between Portugal and Spain , the issue has been a sensitive matter in the relations between these two countries . Olivenza and other neighbouring Spanish ( La Codosera , Alburquerque and Badajoz ) and Portuguese ( Arronches , Campo Maior , Estremoz , Portalegre and Elvas ) towns reached an agreement in 2008 to create a euroregion . Olivenza is located on the left ( east ) bank of the Guadiana river , at an equal distance of 24 km south of Elvas in Portugal and Badajoz in Spain . The territory is triangular , with a smaller side resting on the Guadiana and the opposite vertex entering south-east and surrounded by Spanish territory . By agreement between Spain and Portugal , the left bank of the river ( to a non-defined width , though ) sets de facto border in that area . Besides the town , the municipality of OlivenÃ a includes six villages : SÃ # o Francisco , SÃ # o Rafael , Vila Real , SÃ # o Domingo de GusmÃ # o , SÃ # o Benito da Contenda , and SÃ # o Jorge da Lor ( Catellano : San Francisco , San Rafael , Villa Real , San Domingos de Guzman , San Bento da Contenda , and San Jorge de La Lor ) . Another village , TÃ liga , was detached to become the seat of a separate municipality in 1850 . Total population is 10,762 ( 2002 ) , of which 8,274 live in OlivenÃ a. The total area is 750 kmÂ . Like the surrounding regions , population density is low , at 11 inhabitants per kmÂ . Some monuments include the Saint Mary of the Castle Church ( Portuguese : Igreja de Santa Maria do Castelo , Spanish : Iglesia de Santa MarÃ a del Castillo ) , Holy Ghost Chapel ( Capela do EspÃ rito Santo , Capilla del EspÃ ritu Santo ) , Saint Mary Magdalene Church ( Igreja de Santa Maria Madalena , Iglesia de Santa MarÃ a Magdalena ) , considered a masterwork of Portuguese Manueline architecture ) , Saint John of God Monastery ( Mosteiro de SÃ # o JoÃ # o de Deus , Monasterio de San Juan de Dios ) , the keep ( torre de menagem , torre del homenaje ) , and the ruins of the Our Lady of Help Bridge ( Ponte de Nossa Senhora da Ajuda , Puente de Nuestra SeÃ ora de Ayuda , destroyed in 1709 by spaniards and never rebuilt ) . There are a good amount of Portuguese culture and language in the people . Famous people born in OlivenÃ a include Cardinal Pedro da Fonseca ( ? - after 1419 ) and music composer Vicente Lusitano ( ? - after 1561 ) . Olivenza had been under Portuguese sovereignty since 1297 until it was occupied by the Spanish in 1801 , and formally ceded by Portugal later that year by the Treaty of Badajoz . Spain claims the de jure sovereignty over Olivenza on the grounds that the Treaty of Badajoz still stands and has never been revoked . Thus , the border between the two countries in the region of Olivenza should be as demarcated by that treaty . Portugal claims the de jure sovereignty over Olivenza on the grounds that the Treaty of Badajoz was revoked by its own terms ( the breach of any of its articles would lead to its cancellation ) when Spain invaded Portugal in the Peninsular War of 1807 . Portugal further bases its case on Article 105 of the Treaty of Vienna of 1815 , which Spain signed in 1817 , that states that the winning countries are to `` endeavor with the mightiest conciliatory effort to return Olivenza to Portuguese authority '' . Thus , the border between the two countries in the region of Olivenza should be as demarcated by the Treaty of Alcanizes of 1297 . Spain interprets Article 105 as not being mandatory on demanding Spain to return Olivenza to Portugal , thus not revoking the Treaty of Badajoz . Portugal has never made a formal claim to the territory after the Treaty of Vienna , but has equally never directly acknowledged the Spanish sovereignty over Olivenza . There is no research on the opinion of the inhabitants of Olivenza about their status . Spanish public opinion is not generally aware of the Portuguese claim on Olivenza ( in contrast to the Spanish claim on Gibraltar or the Moroccan claims on Ceuta , Melilla and the Plazas de soberanÃ a ) . On the other hand , awareness in Portugal has been increasing under the efforts of pressure groups to have the question raised and debated in public .

Thyroid cancer is a thyroid neoplasm that is malignant . It can be treated with radioactive iodine or surgical resection of the thyroid gland . Chemotherapy or radiotherapy may also be used . Most often the first symptom of thyroid cancer is a nodule in the thyroid region of the neck . However , many adults have small nodules in their thyroids , but typically under 5 % of these nodules are found to be malignant . Sometimes the first sign is an enlarged lymph node . Later symptoms that can be present are pain in the anterior region of the neck and changes in voice . Thyroid cancer is usually found in a euthyroid patient , but symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism may be associated with a large or metastatic well-differentiated tumor . Thyroid nodules are of particular concern when they are found in those under the age of 20 . The presentation of benign nodules at this age is less likely , and thus the potential for malignancy is far greater . After a thyroid nodule is found during a physical examination , a referral to an endocrinologist , a thyroidologist or otolaryngologist may occur . Most commonly an ultrasound is performed to confirm the presence of a nodule , and assess the status of the whole gland . Measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid antibodies will help decide if there is a functional thyroid disease such as Hashimoto 's thyroiditis present , a known cause of a benign nodular goiter . Thyroid cancers can be classified according to their histopathological characteristics . The following variants can be distinguished ( distribution over various subtypes may show regional variation ) : The follicular and papillary types together can be classified as `` differentiated thyroid cancer '' . These types have a more favorable prognosis than the medullary and undifferentiated types . From the 1940s to 1960s , external , low-dose radiation to the head and neck during infancy and childhood was used to treat many benign diseases . This type of therapy has been shown to predispose persons to thyroid cancer . The younger the patient was at time of exposure , the higher the risk of developing cancer . Another cause may be due to high-dose irradiation to the head and neck . Patients with Hodgkin lymphoma treated with mantlefield irradiation have an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer , although hypothyroidism is more likely . Thyroid cancer may require surgery . Common surgeries include thyroidectomy , lobectomy , and tracheostomy . Radioactive Iodine-131 is used in patients with papillary or follicular thyroid cancer for ablation of residual thyroid tissue after surgery and for the treatment of thyroid cancer . Patients with medullary , anaplastic , and most Hurthle cell cancers do not benefit from this therapy . External irradiation may be used when the cancer is unresectable , when it recurs after resection , or to relieve pain from bone metastasis . Sorafenib and sunitinib , approved for other indications show promise for thyroid cancer and are being used for some patients who do not qualify for clinical trials . Numerous agents are in phase II clinical trials and XL184 has started a phase III trial . The prognosis of thyroid cancer is among the best of all cancers . The primary reason for this is overdiagnosis bias , which occurs because the overwhelming majority of thyroid cancers are overdiagnosed ( that is , will never cause any symptoms , illness , or death for the patient , even if nothing is ever done about the cancer ) . Including these overdiagnosed cases skews the statistics by lumping clinically significant cases in with apparently harmless cancers . Thyroid cancer is incredibly common , with autopsy studies of people dying from other causes showing that more than one third of older adults technically has thyroid cancer , which is causing them no harm . It is easy to detect nodules that might be cancerous , simply by feeling the throat , which contributes to the level of overdiagnosis . However , very few of the people with these accidentally discovered , symptom-free thyroid cancers will ever have any symptoms , and treatment in such patients has only the potential to harm them , not to help them . By European statistics , the overall relative 5-year survival rate for thyroid cancer is 85 % for females and 74 % for males . Prognosis is better in younger people than older ones . Prognosis depends mainly on the type of cancer and cancer stage .
In quantum physics , a quantum fluctuation is the temporary change in the amount of energy in a point in space , arising from Werner Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle . That means that conservation of energy can appear to be violated , but only for small times . This allows the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs of virtual particles . The effects of these particles are measurable , for example , in the effective charge of the electron , different from its `` naked '' charge . In the modern view , energy is always conserved , but the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian ( energy observable ) are not the same as ( i.e. the Hamiltonian does n't commute with ) the particle number operators . Quantum fluctuations may have been very important in the origin of the structure of the universe : according to the model of inflation the ones that existed when inflation began were amplified and formed the seed of all current observed structure . A reasonably odd distinction can be made between quantum fluctuations and thermal fluctuations of a quantum field ( at least for a free field ; for interacting fields , renormalization complicates matters a lot ) . For the quantized Kleinâ `` Gordon field in the vacuum state , we can calculate the probability density that we would observe a configuration The amplitude of quantum fluctuations is controlled by the amplitude of Planck 's constant , just as the amplitude of thermal fluctuations is controlled by . Note that the following three points are closely related : ( 3 ) the quantum vacuum state is Lorentz invariant ( although not manifestly in the above ) , whereas the classical thermal state is not ( the classical dynamics is Lorentz invariant , but the Gibbs probability density is not a Lorentz invariant initial condition ) . We can construct a classical continuous random field that has the same probability density as the quantum vacuum state , so that the principal difference from quantum field theory is the measurement theory ( measurement in quantum theory is different from measurement for a classical continuous random field , in that classical measurements are always mutually compatible -- in quantum mechanical terms they always commute ) . Quantum effects that are consequences only of quantum fluctuations , not of subtleties of measurement incompatibility , can alternatively be modelled by classical continuous random fields .
The New World is one of the names used for the Western Hemisphere , specifically the Americas and sometimes Australia . The term originated in the late 15th century , when America had been recently discovered by European explorers , expanding the geographical horizon of the people of the European middle Ages , who had thought of the world as consisting of Europe , Asia , and Africa : collectively now referred to as the Old World . The Spanish scholar Peter Martyr d'Anghiera coined the term `` New World '' ( novi orbis ) in a letter dated November 1st , 1492 in which he referred to Columbus first voyage to America . In a subsequent letter a year later he again referred to `` the New World '' ( orbis novus ) . In 1516 , Martyr published a work whose title began De orbe novo ( `` On the New World '' ) . In 1524 , the term was also used by Giovanni da Verrazzano in a record of his voyage that year along the Atlantic coast of land that is now part of the United States and Canada . The terms `` Old World '' vs. `` New World '' are primarily meaningful in historical context and for the purpose of distinguishing the world 's major ecozones . One can speak of the `` New World '' in a historical context , e.g. , when discussing the voyages of Christopher Columbus , the Spanish conquest of YucatÃ n and other events of the colonial period ; additionally , the term `` New World '' is sometimes used in a biological context , when one speaks of Old World ( Palearctic , Afrotropic ) and New World species ( Nearctic , Neotropic ) . The term has been criticized as being Eurocentric , patronizing and also for taking an apologetic tone with regards to colonialism .
The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write histories in the form of accounts of the past . The question of the nature , and even the possibility , of a sound historical method is raised in the philosophy of history as a question of epistemology . The first four are known as higher criticism ; the fifth , lower criticism ; and , together , external criticism . The sixth and final inquiry about a source is called internal criticism . R. J. Shafer on external criticism : `` It sometimes is said that its function is negative , merely saving us from using false evidence ; whereas internal criticism has the positive function of telling us how to use authenticated evidence . '' Noting that few documents are accepted as completely reliable , Louis Gottschalk sets down the general rule , `` for each particular of a document the process of establishing credibility should be separately undertaken regardless of the general credibility of the author . '' An author 's trustworthiness in the main may establish a background probability for the consideration of each statement , but each piece of evidence extracted must be weighed individually . R. J. Shafer offers this checklist for evaluating eyewitness testimony : Louis Gottschalk adds an additional consideration : `` Even when the fact in question may not be well-known , certain kinds of statements are both incidental and probable to such a degree that error or falsehood seems unlikely . If an ancient inscription on a road tells us that a certain proconsul built that road while Augustus was princeps , it may be doubted without further corroboration that that proconsul really built the road , but would be harder to doubt that the road was built during the principate of Augustus . If an advertisement informs readers that ' A and B Coffee may be bought at any reliable grocer 's at the unusual price of fifty cents a pound , ' all the inferences of the advertisement may well be doubted without corroboration except that there is a brand of coffee on the market called ' A and B Coffee . ' '' Garraghan says that most information comes from `` indirect witnesses , '' people who were not present on the scene but heard of the events from someone else . Gottschalk says that a historian may sometimes use hearsay evidence . He writes , `` In cases where he uses secondary witnesses , however , he does not rely upon them fully . On the contrary , he asks : ( 1 ) On whose primary testimony does the secondary witness base his statements ? ( 2 ) Did the secondary witness accurately report the primary testimony as a whole ? ( 3 ) If not , in what details did he accurately report the primary testimony ? Satisfactory answers to the second and third questions may provide the historian with the whole or the gist of the primary testimony upon which the secondary witness may be his only means of knowledge . In such cases the secondary source is the historian 's ` original ' source , in the sense of being the ` origin ' of his knowledge . Insofar as this ` original ' source is an accurate report of primary testimony , he tests its credibility as he would that of the primary testimony itself . '' Other methods of verifying oral tradition may exist , such as comparison with the evidence of archaeological remains . More recent evidence concerning the potential reliability or unreliability of oral tradition has come out of fieldwork in West Africa and Eastern Europe . Once individual pieces of information have been assessed in context , hypotheses can be formed and established by historical reasoning . C. Behan McCullagh lays down seven conditions for a successful argument to the best explanation : McCullagh sums up , `` if the scope and strength of an explanation are very great , so that it explains a large number and variety of facts , many more than any competing explanation , then it is likely to be true . '' This is a syllogism in probabilistic form , making use of a generalization formed by induction from numerous examples ( as the first premise ) . McCullagh says that an argument from analogy , if sound , is either a `` covert statistical syllogism '' or better expressed as an argument to the best explanation . It is a statistical syllogism when it is `` established by a sufficient number and variety of instances of the generalization '' ; otherwise , the argument may be invalid because properties 1 through n are unrelated to property n + 1 , unless property n + 1 is the best explanation of properties 1 through ln . AnalOgy , therefore , is uncontroversial only when used to suggest hypotheses , not as a conclusive argument .

The Parable of Drawing in the Net is a well known parable of Jesus . However , it appears in only one of the Canonical gospels of the New Testament . According to Gospel of Matthew it refers to the final judgment . This parable is the seventh and last in , which began with the parable of the Sower . An abbreviated version of the parable also appears in the non canonical Gospel of Thomas ( Saying 8 ) . Like the parable of the Tares , earlier in Matthew 13 , this parable refers to the final judgment . Here , the imagery is drawn from the separation of edible from inedible fish caught by a net , probably a seine net . The passage says that `` the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous '' in a similar way . And wherein does this differ from the parable of the tares ? For there too the one are saved , the other perish ; but there , for choosing of wicked doctrines ; and those before this again , for not giving heed to His sayings , but these for wickedness of life ; who are the most wretched of all , having attained to His knowledge , and being caught , but not even so capable of being saved . Jesus final comments indicate that `` true teachers of the kingdom display the kingdom 's treasure for all to see . ''
F-Zero is a series of futuristic racing games originally created by Nintendo EAD and has been continually produced by Nintendo , although the company has let outside development houses work on some installments . The video game franchise has led to an anime series and a variety of merchandise . The series casually centers around the F-Zero racer Captain Falcon and his talented racing and bounty hunting abilities as well as his encounters with the other F-Zero characters , ranging from superheroes and supervillains to cyborgs , mutants and aliens . Numerous characters were introduced in each completed installment of the franchises ' video games with many of them appearing in multiple titles . The games are either set in the 22nd century or at a later time period , with each game revolving around the high-speed F-Zero Grand Prix races . Each character has their own unique vehicle and reason for entering the F-Zero Grand Prix . The winner of the Grand Prix receives prestige as well as a large sum of prize money . Takaya Imamura was in charge of the character designs for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System games F-Zero and Star Fox . During the development of the F-Zero game , Imamura was surprised at the level of freedom he was given to design the characters and courses since this was his first game . The game 's producer , Shigeru Miyamoto , called the F-Zero characters `` seven heads tall '' in comparison to the characters for Super Mario Kart , who are `` three heads tall in order to suit the design of the karts '' . IGN claimed Captain Falcon `` was thrust into the limelight '' in F-Zero since he was the `` star character '' . An eight-page comic was included in the manual of the original game that carried the reader through one of Captain Falcon 's bounty missions . The character Mr. EAD bears a few character attributes from the Mario series . `` EAD '' is also the same abbreviation used by Nintendo for their internal development group who are responsible for producing the Mario games . The F-Zero character James McCloud bears a resemblance to the Star Fox character Fox McCloud . According to Nintendo Power , `` It 's just one of the fun things the developers decided to put into F-Zero GX . '' Although James is also the name of Fox McCloud 's father in the Star Fox series , they also stated `` As similar in looks as they are , Fox and James McCloud do n't have any connection . '' Toshihiro Nagoshi , one of F-Zero GXs co-producers , was fond of the characters and found a way to draw out their personalities during the games ' development . The co-producer mentioned Amusement Vision was given relative freedom in designing the characters . With the introduction of a story mode in F-Zero GX , Shigeru Miyamoto mentioned that the characters Imamura created are finally `` coming to life and taking on some personality '' . Nagoshi stated that its story mode was included because the development team felt that the F-Zero universe was unique and they wanted to explain some of the characters ' motivations and flesh out the game world . In F-Zero , one of four playable vehicles can be chosen to compete against generic vehicles of different colors as well as the other playable vehicles through each track in its Grand Prix mode . The Nintendo 64 ( N64 ) sequel , F-Zero X , has twenty-seven new characters composed of all the opponents . In the Game Boy Advance title F-Zero : GP Legend , the majority of the characters originally appeared in the N64 game . During GP Legends story scenes , the characters incorporate a Japanese animation style for their character designs as they appear in the cartoon show . Some characters of the F-Zero series have had various toys modeled after the likeness of their vehicles . In December 2003 , a series of toys based on the vehicles in F-Zero GP Legend were distributed in Japan by Bandai . Captain Falcon is one of Nintendo 's most popular characters in the Super Smash Bros. series , but he rarely has a starring role in games he appears in . Reception to the character has been mixed . Andy Eddy described Captain Falcon as a character with no real strengths . Nonetheless , Gamespot 's Jeff Gerstmann called him the `` poster boy '' of the F-Zero franchise . GamePro claims that Captain Falcon demonstrates `` clear superiority '' over other F-Zero characters . Toshihiro Nagoshi stated this character `` has a very strong image , and represents a dominant visual aspect for the series '' . He claimed this is the type of character Sega does not have in their racing games like Daytona or Sega Rally that the player can `` identify with behind the wheel '' . GameDaily named Captain Falcon as the 25th top Nintendo character of all time . Jared Thomas referred to Captain Falcon as `` the only known last legitimate use of the word ` extreme ' '' . UGO remarked that Captain Falcon is `` cool '' for his speed , but came off as annoying when shouting out the names of his attacks . Video game journalist Chris Kohler claimed he greatly enjoyed playing with Captain Falcon in Super Smash Bros. . Brawl . IGN has called Captain Falcon an experienced fighter , and `` one of the most important and recognizable characters '' from the F-Zero franchise who appears always ready to give an `` ass-kicking to anyone that comes his way .

The X Factor is the tenth studio album by Iron Maiden , released in 1995 . It is the band 's first album to include Blaze Bayley , formerly of Wolfsbane , as vocalist , replacing Bruce Dickinson who left the band following their previous tour to pursue a solo career . It is considered Iron Maiden 's darkest album due to the lyrics being based on personal issues surrounding Steve Harris at the time and the album cover , which depicts the band 's mascot , Eddie the Head , being graphically mutilated through surgery . The album title came about in the early part of the recording . According to producer Nigel Green : `` We all felt that the way things were progressing - the songs , Blaze 's new involvement , the sound , the commitment - the new album really would have that extra quality , that bit of magic , that X Factor . This became the working title for the album and we liked it , so we kept it . It is also very apt as this is our tenth studio album and `` X '' can bring up many images . '' Supporting the album was the X Factour tour . Much like the tour for their following album , Virtual XI , it was cut short after Blaze suffered a violent allergic reaction to certain elements used on the stages where the band performed . The X-Factors cover art depicts the operation which left Eddie 's head broken ( first seen on the Piece of Mind album cover ) and was created by Hugh Syme . In some releases , the cover was replaced with a less graphic alternative , showing Eddie from a distance , with the original artwork on the back of the booklet . The idea to bring Iron Maiden 's longtime mascot Eddie into ` real form ' came from band guitarist Dave Murray , up to that point having always been an animated caricature . This is the second album ( Piece of Mind being the first ) that did not have a title track on it , as well as the first album to not feature the album title in any of the song lyrics . It is the first album since Powerslave to feature no songwriting from Dave Murray . This album is also unusual for the band in that it produced several band compositions that did not make it onto the album . `` Justice of The Peace '' and `` Judgement Day '' would turn up on the Best of the ` B ' Sides collection and the Eddie 's Archive box set , but `` I Live My Way '' would not . All three were released at the time of the album as B-sides . `` Man on the Edge '' and `` Lord of the Flies '' were released as singles . Both of these songs , and `` Sign of the Cross , '' remained in Maiden set lists following Bruce Dickinson 's return . Live versions of these songs can be found on the single for `` The Wicker Man '' and the live albums Death on the Road and Rock in Rio respectively . `` The Edge of Darkness '' is based on the 1979 movie Apocalypse Now , which is based on Joseph Conrad 's novella Heart of Darkness , Man on the Edge is based on the 1993 movie , Falling Down and `` Lord of the Flies '' is based on the novel of the same name . `` Sign of the Cross '' is based on a man suffering through the Spanish Inquisition and is Iron Maiden 's second longest song at more than 11 minutes long , the longest being `` Rime of the Ancient Mariner '' at 13 minutes ( from Powerslave ) . Live versions of `` Blood on the World 's Hands '' and `` The Aftermath '' can be found in Best of the ` B ' Sides compilation album .

A megachurch is a church having 2,000 or more in average weekend attendance . The Hartford Institute 's database lists more than 1,300 such Protestant churches in the United States . According to that data , approximately 50 churches on the list have attendance ranging from 10,000 to 47,000 . While 3,000 individual Roman Catholic parishes ( churches ) have 2,000 or more attendants for an average Sunday Mass , these churches are not seen as part of the megachurch movement . Globally , these large congregations are a significant development in Protestant Christianity . While generally associated with the United States , the phenomenon has spread worldwide . In 2007 , five of the ten largest Protestant churches were in South Korea . Most megachurches tend to be evangelical or Pentecostal , and are often semi-independent from the major Christian denominations . The megachurch movement , with a large number of local congregants who return on a weekly basis , is usually thought to have begun in the 1950s . There have been large churches earlier in history , but they were considerably rarer . Examples include Charles Spurgeon 's Baptist Metropolitan Tabernacle in London which attracted 5,000 weekly for years in the late 19th century , and religious broadcaster Aimee Semple McPherson 's Angelus Temple in Los Angeles , which was similarly large . The current largest megachurch in the world is the Yoido Full Gospel Church , with 830,000 members as of 2007 . The advent of television in the 1950 's , and the Internet in the 1990 's and 2000 's have been seen as a motivator for mega churches as megachurch services are often broadcasted . In the United States , more than half of these large church institutions are non-denominational churches . Those that have ties to a larger body are most often members of the Southern Baptist denomination , which accounts for perhaps one in five megachurches . The Assemblies of God claim approximately one in ten . Another one-tenth of the megachurches are associated with historically African American denominations , such as African Methodist Episcopal , ( A.M.E. ) , and the Church of God in Christ ( COGIC ) . Coping with the large numbers of people who attend megachurches requires many adjustments . The immense architecture of the megachurch requires that the entire congregation can see and hear . Large open spaces allow line of sight to elaborate video presentations and projections . The need for large parking lots to accommodate worshipers has often led these churches to be located on the outskirts of large cities , on tracts encompassing multiple acres . A recent trend shows megachurches may have one or more `` satellite '' locations away from the main church , which will have a small local staff . However , the main message is presented by the senior pastor via video presentation . This is referred to as the multi-site movement . The ministry of these churches must also be adjusted for size . Much of the actual teaching work of the church is handled by committees and smaller meetings outside the weekly services themselves , which are almost exclusively meant for collective ( sometimes enthusiastic ) worship , with relatively few people engaged in up-front roles . Congregational oversight is generally limited to an annual meeting ( where a budget and `` board of directors '' is approved ) ; in some cases , the senior pastor has complete authority over all decisions . Many megachurches were launched by a single pastor , a person who combined engaging sermons with the organizational skills needed to facilitate a large scale weekly service and the ability to manage the team who runs the individual church . To complement the large-scale sermons , some churches supplement this strongly with smaller independent groups ( called `` cell churches '' by some , notably David Yonggi Cho ) . A common criticism of megachurches is that they draw members away from other churches . This has led to use of the derisive term , `` big box churches '' . The majority of North American church-goers attend small churches of fewer than 200 members . Critics of megachurches claim that such churches are more concerned with entertainment than religion , earning them the nickname `` Disney churches '' or `` Six Flags over Jesus '' . Al Sharpton has claimed that such churches focus on personal morality issues while ignoring social justice . Critics have also raised issues with the application of secular business models , e.g. , from Wal-Mart ; a seeker-friendly approach , intensive market research , heavy reliance upon opinion polls , polished advertising targeted at affluent young professionals , unconventional worship styles and Eastern influences . Some megachurches , such as the Christian Open Door , are sometimes criticized by former members and anti-cult associations for an alleged use of cultic practices .
The vaquita ( Phocoena sinus ) is a rare species of porpoise . It is endemic to the northern part of the Gulf of California . Estimates of the number of individuals alive range from 100 to 300 . The word `` vaquita '' is Spanish for little cow . Other names include Cochito , Gulf of California Harbor Porpoise , Gulf of California Porpoise , Gulf Porpoise , Hafenschweinswal , and Marsouin du Golfe de Californie . The Vaquita has a classic porpoise shape ( stocky and curved into a star shape when viewed from the side ) . It is the smallest of the porpoises . Individuals may grow up to 150 centimetres ( 4.92 ft ) in length and weigh up to 50 kilograms ( 110.2 lb ) . They have large black eye rings and lip patches . The upper side of the body is medium to dark gray . The underside is off-white to light gray but the demarcation between the sides is indistinct . The flippers are proportionately larger than in other phocoenids and the fin is taller and more falcate . The skull is smaller and the rostrum is shorter and broader than in other members of the genus . The vaquita lives in shallow , murky lagoons along the shoreline and is rarely seen in water much deeper than 30 meters ; indeed , it can survive in lagoons so shallow that its back protrudes above the surface . Other characteristics of its habitat are strong tidal mixing , convection processes and high primary and secondary productivity . There are very few records of the Vaquita in the wild . It appears to swim and feed in a leisurely manner , but is elusive and will avoid boats of any kind . It rises to breathe with a slow , forward-rolling movement that barely disturbs the surface of the water , and then disappears quickly , often for a long time . It has an indistinct blow , but makes a loud , sharp , puffing sound reminiscent of the Harbour Porpoise . All of the 17 fish species found in vaquita stomachs can be classified as demersal and or benthic species inhabiting relatively shallow water in the upper Gulf of California , and it appears that the vaquita is a rather non-selective feeder on small fishes and squids in this zone . Like other phocoenids , the Vaquita occurs singly or in small groups , usually from 1 - 3 individuals but as many as 8 - 10 . Most calving apparently occurs in the spring . Gestation is probably 10 â `` 11 months . Maximum observed life span was 21 years . Vaquita have never been hunted directly . Indeed their continued existence was only confirmed by a dedicated survey in 1985 . However it is known that the Vaquita population is declining , and that this is due to animals becoming trapped in gillnets intended for capturing another species endemic to the Gulf , the totoaba . CIRVA , the Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita , concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets . The Vaquita is listed by the IUCN and the Convention on International Trade in the Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora in the most critical category at risk of extinction . In order to try to prevent extinction , the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering the upper part of the Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta . CIRVA is recommending that this reserve be extended southwards to cover the full known area of the Vaquita 's range and that trawlers be completely banned from the reserve area . Even if the number of Vaquita killed by fisheries is reduced to zero , concerns remain amongst conservationists . Use of chlorinated pesticides , reduced flow of freshwater from the Colorado River due to irrigation , and depression due to inbreeding may also have a detrimental effect . The Vaquita is one of the top 100 EDGE Species , meaning `` Evolutionarily Distinct , Globally Endangered '' . Evolutionarily distinct animals have no close relatives and represent proportionally more of the tree of life than other species , meaning they are top priority for conservation campaigns . On October 28 , 2008 Canada , Mexico , and the United States , under the jurisdiction of the NAFTA environmental organization , the Commission for Environmental Cooperation , launched the North American Conservation Action Plan ( NACAP ) for the Vaquita . The NACAP is a strategy to support Mexicoâ s efforts to recover the Vaquita , which is considered the worldâ s most-endangered marine mammal . The U.S. government has listed the vaquita as endangered under the Endangered Species Act .
Islam is a minority religion in Austria with 4.22 % of the population in the 2001 census . In 2010 , it is estimated to be around 400,000 to 500,000 Muslims in Austria , or up to about 6 % of the total population . According to a study by the Austrian Society for International Understanding , Islam is set to officially overtake Protestantism as the country 's second-largest religious group by 2010 . Most Muslims came to Austria during the 1960s as migrant workers from Turkey , Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia . There are also communities of Arab and Pakistani origin . The westernmost Bundesland Vorarlberg with its industrial small towns and villages has the highest share of Muslims in the country with 8.36 % ( it resembles the neighboring north-eastern parts of Switzerland in this respect ) . It is followed by the capital Vienna with 7.82 % . The central BundeslÃ nder Salzburg , Upper Austria , Tyrol and Lower Austria follow with the share of Muslim population at around the average . South-eastern states of Styria , Carinthia as well as Burgenland in the east have fewer Muslims whose numbers are below the national average . Austria is unique among Western European countries insofar as it has granted Muslims the status of a recognized religious community . This dates back to the times following Austria-Hungary 's annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878 . Austria has regulated the religious freedoms of the Muslim community with the so called `` Anerkennungsgesetz '' ( `` Act of Recognition '' ) . This law was reactivated in 1979 when the Community of Muslim believers in Austria ( Islamische Glaubensgemeinschaft in Ã -- sterreich ) was founded . This organization is entitled to give lessons of religious education in state schools . It is also allowed to collect `` church tax '' but so far it has not exercised this privilege and does not build , finance or administer mosques in Austria . Parallel structures exist within the Islamic religious group . The religious life takes place in mosques belonging to organizations that represent one of the currents of Turkish , Bosnian and Arab Muslims . Among the Turkish organizations the `` Federation of Turkish-Islamic Associations '' is controlled by the Directorate for Religious Affairs , whereas the other groups , such as the SÃ 1\/4 leymancÄ s and Milli GÃ rÃ 1\/4 Å , may be considered as branches of the pan-European organization centered in Germany .
Camelids are members of the biological family Camelidae , the only living family in the suborder Tylopoda . Dromedaries , Bactrian Camels , llamas , alpacas , vicuÃ as , and guanacos are in this group . Camelids are even-toed ungulates : they are classified in the order Artiodactyla , along with pigs , peccaries , hippos , cattle , goats , antelope and many others . Camelids are large animals with slender necks and long legs , and are strictly herbivorous . Camelids differ from true ruminants in a number of ways . Their dentition shows traces of vesitigial central incisors in the upper jaw , and the third incisors are developed into canine-like tusks . Camelids also have true canine teeth and tusk-like premolars which are separated from the molars by a gap . The musculature of the hind limbs differs from those of other ungulates by the fact that the legs are attached to the body at the top of the thigh only , rather than attached by skin and muscle from the knee downwards . Because of this , camelids have to lie down by resting on their knees with their legs tucked underneath the body . They have a three-chambered rather than a four-chambered digestive tract , an upper lip that is split in two with each part separately mobile , and uniquely among mammals , elliptical red blood cells . They also have a unique type of antibodies lacking the light chain , in addition to the normal antibodies found in other mammals . These so-called heavy-chain antibodies are being used to develop single-domain antibodies with potential pharmaceutical applications . They do not have hooves , rather a two-toed foot with toenails and a soft footpad ( Tylopoda is Latin for `` padded foot '' ) . The main weight of the animal is borne by these tough , leathery sole-pads . The South American camelids , adapted to steep and rocky terrain , can move the pads on their toes to maintain grip . Many fossil camelids were unguligrade and probably hooved , in contrast to all living species . The two Afro-Asian camel species have developed extensive adaptations to their life in harsh , near-waterless environments . Wild populations of the bactrian camel are even able to drink brackish water , and some herds live in nuclear test areas . Camelids are unusual in that their modern distribution is almost a mirror-image of their origin . Camelids first appeared very early in the evolution of the even-toed ungulates , around 45 million years ago during the middle Eocene , in present-day North America . Among the earliest camelids was the rabbit-sized Protylopus , which still had four toes on each foot . By the late Eocene around 35 million years ago , camelids such as Poebrotherium had lost the two lateral toes , and were about the size of a modern goat . The family diversified and prospered but remained confined to the North American continent until only about 2 or 3 million years ago , when representatives arrived in Asia , and ( as part of the Great American Interchange that followed the formation of the Isthmus of Panama ) , South America . The original camelids of North America remained common until the quite recent geological past , but then disappeared , possibly as a result of hunting or habitat alterations by the earliest human settlers , but more likely as a result of changing environmental conditions after the last Ice Age . Three species groups survived : the Dromedary of northern Africa and south-west Asia ; the Bactrian Camel of central Asia ; and the South American group , which has now diverged into a range of forms that are closely related but usually classified as four species : Llamas , Alpacas , Guanacos , and VicuÃ as . Fossil camelids show a wider variety than their modern counterparts . One North American genus , Titanotylopus , stood 3.5 metres at the shoulder , compared with the approximately two metres of the largest modern camelids . Other extinct camelids included small , gazelle-like animals , such as Stenomylus . Finally , there were a number of very tall , giraffe-like camelids , adapted to feeding on leaves from high trees , including such genera as Aepycamelus , and Oxydactylus . The newly discovered giant Syrian Camel is yet to be officially described .

British Rail class D3\/12 was a class of three experimental diesel-electric shunting locomotives designed by Richard Maunsell of the Southern Railway in 1937 . They quickly proved their effectiveness , and although they were not immediately replicated due to the advent of the Second World War , the class were the basis for a larger class of similar locomotives introduced by Oliver Bulleid in 1949 . Once the UK economy began to improve in the mid 1930s , the Southern Railway had further need for heavy shunting locomotives in its marshalling yards around London . The Z class steam locomotives had proved successful for this task but Maunsell wanted to compare their performance with diesel-electric alternatives . He therefore sought authorisation for the construction of three experimental locomotives for use in the busy Norwood marshalling yard where there was a continuous need for such locomotives . No private manufacturer was in a position to build the new locomotives and so they were jointly constructed by the Southern Railway 's Ashford works , who constructed the framing , cabs and bodywork , and English Electric Ltd of Preston , who fitted the traction motors . The three locomotives were also provided with duplicate controls to enable them to be driven by one man from either side of the cab . They were delivered during September and October 1937 . After a few teething problems , the class quickly proved the advantages of diesel electric shunters in terms of effectiveness , cost-saving , and driver comfort . Although at Â # 7,275 they cost Â # 1,100 more to build than a Z class steam locomotive , each one saved about Â # 1,700 per year in operating costs . They could be used continually day and night for six days each week at Norwood without any service requirement beyond refuelling . They were however found to be too slow for their secondary task of freight transfers around the congested passenger lines in the London area , although perfectly well suited to this traffic on rural lines . As a result of these experiments Maunsell 's successor , Oliver Bulleid , received authorisation to build a further eight members of the class in July 1939 but this order was quickly canceled as a result of the outbreak of the Second World War . Between 1941 and 1945 the locomotives were commandeered by the War Department for use on the Martin Mill military railway to haul cross-channel gun installations and ammunition . ( Diesel locomotives were required for this task as they would not give away their position to enemy gunners . ) They were returned to the Southern Railway in 1945 . Following the formation of British Railways in 1948 , twenty-six similar , but lighter locomotives were constructed to Bulleid 's design . These later became British Rail Class 12 . The three original locomotives continued their traditional work around London . Two of the locomotives were however loaned to the Western Region between 1951 and 1953 for use at the Acton marshalling yard . After replacement at Norwood by more modern locomotives they worked as shunters at Hither Green , at Eastleigh and Ashford works . One was also tried out at Lancing Carriage Works in 1961 as a replacement for the aged `` Stroudley Terrier '' but was found to be too slow . Although they were still in good operating condition , the locomotives were withdrawn in November and December 1964 , as by then the Southern Region had many modern replacements . None has been preserved . The original intention was to number the locomotives 958 to 960 , following on from the steam locomotives of the Z class , but as delivered they were numbered 1 to 3 in a separate list from the SR 's steam locomotives . They were later renumbered by British Railways 15201 â `` 15203 .
Laurel Hill is a city in Okaloosa County , Florida , United States . The population was 549 at the 2000 census . As of 2004 , the population recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau is 576 .

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 8.1 km2 ( 3.1 mi2 ) , all land . As of the census of 2000 , there were 549 people , 223 households , and 158 families residing in the city . The population density was 67.5 \/ km2 ( 174.9 \/ mi2 ) . There were 254 housing units at an average density of 31.2 \/ km2 ( 80.9 \/ mi2 ) . The racial makeup of the city was 77.23 % White , 21.68 % African American , 0.18 % Native American , 0.73 % from other races , and 0.18 % from two or more races . Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.09 % of the population . There were 223 households out of which 30.9 % had children under the age of 18 living with them , 49.8 % were married couples living together , 17.0 % had a female householder with no husband present , and 29.1 % were non-families . 25.6 % of all households were made up of individuals and 11.7 % had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older . The average household size was 2.46 and the average family size was 2.93 . In the city the population was spread out with 26.8 % under the age of 18 , 5.8 % from 18 to 24 , 27.7 % from 25 to 44 , 24.0 % from 45 to 64 , and 15.7 % who were 65 years of age or older . The median age was 39 years . For every 100 females there were 90.0 males . For every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 85.3 males . The median income for a household in the city was $ 25,385 , and the median income for a family was $ 28,281 . Males had a median income of $ 25,809 versus $ 17,500 for females .

About 18.0 % of families and 21.6 % of the population were below the poverty line , including 25.2 % of those under age 18 and 9.4 % of those age 65 or over . The area which is now Laurel Hill was one of the first English-speaking settlements in Florida . Settlers were documented establishing a community , originally known as Almirante , soon after Florida 's acquisition by the United States in 1821 . In the 1880s , railroad access to north-west Florida opened up a booming lumber industry , with the Yellow River Railroad reaching the Almirante ( Laurel Hill ) area by 1892 . In 1895 Almirante , then just a small logging and farming community , was platted and renamed Laurel Hill , the name purportedly inspired by a large laurel tree which grew in the center of the community . Growing rapidly , the community was incorporated by the Florida Legislature in 1905 . Although in 1915 Laurel Hill was the largest community in newly created Okaloosa County , the town lost out becoming the Okaloosa county seat to the more centrally located town of Crestview . Laurel Hill 's economic fortunes went into a decline after World War I , a waning intensified by the Florida land speculation collapse of the 1920s which resulted in the closing of Laurel Hill 's only bank . In order to install infrastructure improvements and to re-stimulate the community , Laurel Hill was reincorporated in 1953 . Once served by the Louisville & Nashville Railroad , which purchased the Yellow River Railroad in 1906 , the line was abandoned and lifted in the 1980s .

Lamrim ( Tibetan : `` stages of the path '' ) is a Tibetan Buddhist textual form for presenting the stages in the complete path to enlightenment as taught by Buddha . In Tibetan Buddhist history there have been many different versions of lamrim , presented by different teachers of the Nyingma , Kagyu and Gelug schools . However , all versions of the lamrim are elaborations of AtiÅ a 's 11th Century root text A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment ( BodhipathapradÄ `` pa ) . When AtiÅ a , the originator of the lamrim came from India to Tibet , he was asked to give a complete and easily accessible summary of the doctrine in order to clarify wrong views , especially those resulting from apparent contradictions across the sutras and their commentaries . Based upon this request he taught what came to be known as the lamrim for the Tibetans . He was subsequently honored for this by the pandits of his alma mater in India , the monastic university of VikramaÅ Ä `` la. . AtiÅ a 's presentation of the doctrine later became known as the Kadampa tradition in Tibet . Gampopa , a Kadampa monk and student of the famed yogi Milarepa , introduced the lamrim to his disciples as a way of developing the mind gradually . His exposition of lamrim is known in English translation as `` The Jewel Ornament of Liberation '' and is studied to this day in the various Kagyu schools of Tibetan Buddhism . Tsongkhapa , founder of the Gelug school which is primarily based on AtiÅ a 's Kadampa school , wrote one of his masterpieces on lamrim : The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment ( Tib . Lam-rim Chen-mo ) which has about 1000 pages , and is primarily based on literary sources . There is also a medium-length lamrim text by Tsongkhapa ( 200 pages ) and a short one , called Lam-rim DÃ 1\/4 - dÃ n ( Tib . ) , which is recited daily by many Gelugpas and is about 10 pages long . Tibetan Buddhists believe that the teachings of the lamrim are based on the sutras that the Buddha taught and that the Buddha taught the short , middling and extensive wisdom sutra simultaneously . These wisdom sutras were taken by Maitreya and Asaá ga as the starting point for their encyclopaedic work , the Ornament of clear realizations ( AbhisamayÄ laá kÄ ra ) in which they emphasised the hidden meanings of the sutras . The hidden meanings are believed to be contained in the number and order of the subjects . The number and order of the subjects are vital if someone wants to put the philosophy into practice . AtiÅ a took the number and order of the subjects in the Ornament of clear realizations ( AbhisamayÄ laá kÄ ra ) as the basis to write the first lamrim text : the Lamp of the Path that therefore contains the essential points of all sutra teachings in their logical order for practice . The starting point of the lamrim is a division of Buddhist practitioners into beings of three scopes , based upon the motivation of their religious activity . Disregarded in this division are individuals whose motives revolve around benefits in their current life . Striving for a favorable rebirth is implicitly the minimum requirement for an activity or practice to be classified as spiritual . Persons of modest motive search for happiness within samsara ; their motive is to achieve high rebirth . Buddhists traditionally consider that this domain includes followers of most non-Buddhist religions who strive for a rebirth in a heaven . Persons of medium motive are searching for their own ultimate peace and abandon worldly pleasure . This includes the paths of pratyekabuddhas and Å ravakabuddhas , which seek personal liberation alone , the traditional goal of HÄ `` nayÄ na practice . Based on their insight of their own suffering , persons of high motive seek by all means to stop the suffering of all beings . This is the MahÄ yÄ na path of the samyaksaá buddhas . Although lamrim texts cover much the same subject areas , subjects within them may be arranged in different ways . The lamrim of AtiÅ a starts with bodhicitta , the altruistic mind of enlightenment , followed by taking the bodhisattva vows . Gampopa 's lamrim , however , starts with the Buddha nature , followed by the preciousness of human rebirth . Tsongkhapa 's texts start with reliance on a guru ( Tib . : lama ) , followed by the preciousness of human rebirth , and continue with the paths of the modest , medium and high scopes . Gampopa and Tsongkhapa expanded the short root-text of AtiÅ a into an extensive system to understand the entire Buddhist philosophy . In this way , subjects like karma , rebirth , Buddhist cosmology and the practice of meditation are gradually explained in logical order . A commonly used outline for lamrim teachings today in English translation from Tibetan is that of Liberation in the Palm of your Hand by Pabongka Rinpoche . An abbreviated and annotated outline follows to show the structure of this lamrim . which will lead you to a favourable rebirth within cyclic existence in the human - , demigod - , or god realm .

Ziziphus is a genus of about 40 species of spiny shrubs and small trees in the buckthorn family , Rhamnaceae , distributed in the warm-temperate and subtropical regions throughout the world . The leaves are alternate , entire , with three prominent basal veins , and 2 - long ; some species are deciduous , others evergreen . The flowers are small , inconspicuous yellow-green . The fruit is an edible drupe , yellow-brown , red , or black , globose or oblong , 1 - long , often very sweet and sugary , reminiscent of a date in texture and flavor . Well known species includes Z. zizyphus ( Jujube ) , Z. spina-christi from southwestern Asia , Z. lotus from the Mediterranean region , and Ber ( Ziziphus mauritiana ) , which is found from western Africa to India . Ziziphus joazeiro grows in the Caatinga of Brazil . The generic name is derived from zizfum or zizafun , the Persian word for Z. lotus . Ziziphus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Bucculatrix zizyphella , which feeds exclusively on the genus , and Endoclita malabaricus . In traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) , suan zao ren ( Ziziphus spinosa ) is considered to be sweet and sour in taste , and neutral in action . It is believed to nourish the heart yin , augment the liver blood , and calm the spirit ( TCM medical terms ) . It is used to treat irritability , insomnia and heart palpitations . The mythological lotus tree is often equated with Z. lotus , though the Date Palm is also a possible candidate .

A passenger is a term broadly used to describe any person who travels in a vehicle , but bears little or no responsibility for the tasks required for that vehicle to arrive at its destination . Crew members ( if any ) , as well as the driver or pilot of the vehicle , are usually not considered to be passengers . For example , a flight attendant on an airline would not be considered a `` passenger '' while on duty , but an employee riding in a company car being driven by another person would be considered a passenger , even if the car was being driven on company business . In railway parlance , ` passenger ' , as well as being the end user of a service , is also a categorisation of the type of rolling stock used . In the British case , there are several categories of passenger train . These categories include :

`` Like a Surgeon '' is a song by `` Weird Al '' Yankovic . It is a parody of `` Like a Virgin '' by Madonna . The promo single only contains `` Like a Surgeon '' . Although Yankovic refuses to use parody ideas from other people , Madonna is partly responsible for `` Like a Surgeon '' . Madonna asked one of her friends how long it would take until Yankovic satirized her song `` Like a Virgin '' as `` Like a Surgeon '' . This friend was a mutual friend of Al 's manager , Jay Levey . When word got back to Yankovic , he decided it was a good idea and wrote the song . This is the only known time that Yankovic has gotten a parody idea directly from the original artist . The music video , which takes place in a hospital , can be considered an extension of the parody . Several features of `` Like a Virgin '' 's promotional video - famously set in Venice - are mimicked : shots of Yankovic singing on a moving gurney are substituted for footage of Madonna on a canal boat , and both videos feature a lion at the beginning . For the 1990 Blond Ambition Tour , Madonna re-invented `` Like a Virgin '' with a middle-eastern arrangement and risquÃ , and ultimately infamous , choreography . Yankovic ultimately decided to parody her performance ( a bit less risquÃ ) : when played live in concert , the song features Yankovic rolling around on a hospital bed that is placed in the middle of the stage while keyboardist RubÃ n Valtierra belly dances next to him . This version of `` Like a Surgeon , '' often called the `` Like a Surgeon ( Truth or Dare Version ) '' is currently performed in concert by Yankovic .

In 1910 word leaked out about a gold strike on Long Creek , 30 miles south of Ruby , and a stampede was on . Discoveries on other nearby creeks followed and Ruby became the supply point for the mines . At its peak the population was near 3000 . By 1918 The town was in decline . Many of the men had left to fight in World War I and several of the towns business people and their families were lost in the sinking of the ship Sophia . A fire in 1929 destroyed much of the business district and a flood in 1931 took out what was left of buildings on the river front . After World War II the population of the community had left . Natives from the village of Kokrines moved in to take advantage of the abandoned homes . There are currently less than 200 people living in Ruby . Local residents nicknamed the town `` The Gem of the Yukon '' , because it is located along the Yukon River and also the name resembles that of a ruby gemstone . More information on the history of Ruby and genealogy can be found at http://rubyalaska.info . The largest gold nugget ever found in Alaska ( 294.10 Troy Ounces ) was found near Ruby , Alaska in 1998 .

Roberto Alagna ( born 7 June 1963 ) is a French operatic tenor of Sicilian ( Italian ) descent . He was born in Clichy-sous-Bois , Seine-Saint-Denis , France . Alagna was born outside of the city of Paris in 1963 to a family of Sicilian ( Italian ) immigrants . As a teenager , the young Alagna began busking and singing pop in Parisian cabarets for tips . Influenced primarily by the films of Mario Lanza , but also from recordings of many historic tenors , he then switched to opera , but remained largely self-taught . After winning the Luciano Pavarotti Voice Competition , Alagna made his professional debut in 1988 as Alfredo Germont in La Traviata with the Glyndebourne touring company . This led to many engagements throughout the smaller cities in France and Italy , mainly again as Alfredo , a role he would eventually sing over 150 times . His reputation grew and he was soon invited to sing at major theaters such as La Scala in 1990 , Covent Garden in 1992 and the Metropolitan Opera as Rodolfo in 1996 . His performances of RomÃ o in RomÃ o et Juliette by Charles Gounod at Covent Garden in 1994 ( opposite Leontina Vaduva ) catapulted him to international stardom . Alagna opened the 2006\/07 season at La Scala on 7 December 2006 in the new production of AÃ da by Franco Zeffirelli . During the second performance on 10 December , Alagna , whose opening performance was considered ill-at-ease , was booed and whistled from the loggione ( the least expensive seats at the very back of La Scala ) , and he walked off the stage . The tenor 's reaction to his public criticism was denounced as immature and unprofessional by La Scala management and Zeffirelli , who said , â A professional should never behave in this way . Alagna is too sensitive , it is too easy to hurt his feelings . He does not know how to act like a true star . â The role of Radames was taken over successfully for the rest of the performance by his understudy Antonello Palombi , who entered on stage wearing jeans and a black shirt . In 2007 while at the Metropolitan Opera singing the role of Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly , Alagna replaced the indisposed Rolando Villazon as Romeo in RomÃ o et Juliette opposite Anna Netrebko for two performances in September and two performances in December . His wife had flown to New York to be with him for the September engagements , and as a result was fired from the Lyric Opera of Chicago for missing her rehearsal dates for La BohÃ me . Alagna was also engaged by the Metropolitan Opera at the last minute to cover for the indisposed Marco Berti in a 16 October 2007 performance of Aida . After the performance , the audience gave him a standing ovation . The December 15 performance of RomÃ o et Juliette starring Alagna and Netrebko was broadcast by the Met into 447 theaters worldwide in high definition and seen by about 97,000 people . Alagna 's first wife , Florence Lancien , died of a brain tumor in 1994 ; they had one daughter , Ornella , who was born in 1992 . In 1996 he married Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu . The couple have sung together often onstage and have made many recordings together both of duets and arias and complete operas . The two singers also starred in a film version of Puccini 's Tosca directed by French film director BenoÃ t Jacquot . In October 2009 , Alagna said in an interview in Le Figaro that he and Angela Gheorghiu had separated . Following the separation , Gheorghiu declined to appear opposite him in Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera in December 2009 .
Jack Fabian PeÃ ate ( ; born 2 September 1984 , Blackheath , London ) is an English musician and singer-songwriter signed to XL Recordings . Jack PeÃ ate attended St. Olave 's Preparatory School , New Eltham until he left to attend Alleyn 's School when he was 18 years of age . His grandfather was Mervyn Peake , author of the Gormenghast books . PeÃ ate made his way up the ranks of the club and bar scene of London before he was signed by record label XL Recordings . He released his first promo single in October 2006 , `` Second Minute or Hour '' along with its b-side track , `` Got My Favourite '' . This single was released by the record label Young Turks , as a 1000-only limited 7 inch , each containing a different Polaroid photograph , taken of PeÃ ate . And in April 2007 he released the `` Spit At Stars EP '' . In addition to the title track , this featured `` My Yvonne '' , `` Cold Thin Line '' and a cover of Darondo Pulliam and Al Turner 's `` Did n't I '' . The CD edition of the EP also included the first song he ever wrote , `` Jack Of All Trades '' , which he wrote with his band at school called `` Jack 's Basement '' . He has appeared on XFM radio 's `` Xposure '' and his first two singles were both Single of the Week on BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe 's show . On 10 August 2007 , he announced that his album would be released on 1 October and be titled MatinÃ e. However , on 7 September , this date was pushed back to 8 October , because more time was needed to `` finish off all the bits of artwork for the inside cover and because my neck is playing up again . '' PeÃ ate also stated that `` I 've been told it 's now in production so hopefully there wo n't be any more delays . '' The album debuted at number seven in the UK album charts . On 3 January 2009 , XFM played a new track by PeÃ ate called `` Tonight 's Today '' , the song ended up being the first single from his second album Everything Is New . On 24 August 2009 , PeÃ ate released his new single `` Pull My Heart Away '' . This single was also available for free single of the week download on the Australian iTunes . This track was also played in the credits of the film Charles St Cloud . He has also announced an autumn tour that will take him to cities including Dublin , Belfast , Glasgow , and Manchester . At PeÃ ate 's concerts , it is customary that audience members enter the stage while the song `` Torn On The Platform '' is performed . One such stage invasion at the Oxford Zodiac on 22 April 2007 resulted in a fan stealing PeÃ ate 's distortion pedal . After he 'd realized it was missing he proclaimed , â Dâ you know what ? Whoever 's got it ... keep it ! Just make sure you play a Telecaster through it and not a Gibson ! â
The British Rail Class 77 , also known as Class EM2 , is a class of 1.5 kV DC , Co-Co electric locomotive . They were built by Metropolitan-Vickers in 1953 â `` 1954 for use over the Woodhead Line between Manchester and Sheffield . Seven locomotives of this type were constructed . They represented the first Co-Co type of overhead electric locomotive built for use in the United Kingdom . The design was based on that of the smaller Class EM1 , which dated from 1941 . Initially , 27 locomotives of this type had been planned , but by the early 1950s , the benefits of using the 25 kV AC system had been demonstrated , which meant that the Woodhead Line would be an isolated electric system . Consequently the order was cut to just seven locomotives . The locomotives were initially numbered 27000-27006 and were painted in BR black livery . Construction took place at Gorton Works , Manchester with electrical equipment supplied by Metropolitan-Vickers . All seven were named after characters from Greek mythology in 1959-1960 . They were primarily used for express passenger trains between Manchester Piccadilly and Sheffield Victoria . In 1957 , the class was renumbered with the addition of an `` E '' prefix to the number . In the early 1960s , the class started to receive the standard BR green livery . At least one of the class , E27002 , received the electric blue livery carried by the AC electric locomotives . The class was withdrawn en masse in September 1968 . They were stored at Bury by BR in the hope of sale to a foreign railway . The passenger service for which the Class 77s were built continued to be operated by Class 76s , but was withdrawn on 5 January 1970 . The Woodhead Line was closed in 1981 . Forty more powerful class 46 electric locomotives were built by Metropolitan-Vickers in the mid-1950s for New South Wales . The class 46 was based on the EM1 and EM2 . In September 1969 the entire class was sold to the Dutch national railway operator Nederlandse Spoorwegen , where they became NS 1500 Class . They were renumbered in the 1500 series in the order they left their workshops , where they received various modifications , including new headlight clusters . The locomotives also retained their names . One locomotive , no. . E27005 Minerva was broken up and used for spares . The remaining six locomotives were employed until final withdrawal in 1986 . Their main work was on The Hagueâ '' Cologne express trains as far as the border at Venlo although they traveled to their home depot at Maastricht either with a train or light engine on Sunday for their weekly examination before returning to traffic the following day . They were sometimes to be found on freight trains bound for the German border originating in the Rotterdam area .
Eldon is a city in Wapello County , Iowa , United States . The population was 998 at the 2000 census .

Scott William Raynor , Jr. ( born May 23 , 1978 ) is an American drummer best known for being a founding member of the band Blink-182 . Raynor first started drumming when he joined a band with some friends because , according to him , they had taken all the `` good instruments '' before Raynor could choose . Raynor cites Fugazi and Metallica as his favorite bands . Raynor and guitarist Tom DeLonge began playing together in DeLonge 's garage when they were in high school . They played with a couple of other members until they met bassist Mark Hoppus in 1992 and Hoppus became a permanent member . In later interviews , the members of Blink-182 would claim DeLonge and Hoppus met first . They wrote a few songs together , including `` Carousel . '' In 1993 they began working on demos , recording Flyswatter in Raynor 's bedroom . Their last demo , Buddha , was recorded at Double Time Studios in San Diego , California , and released by Filter Records . It was remastered and re-released in 1998 by Kung Fu Records . In 1993 the band began recording their album Cheshire Cat at Westbeach Recorders . The album was finished and released in February 1994 on cassette , then released on CD in 1995 and remastered and re-released in 1998 by Cargo Music\/Grilled Cheese Records . In late 1994 they released a split called Short Bus with Iconoclasts on Big Weenie Records . In 1995 the band released an EP called They Came to Conquer ... Uranus on Cargo\/Grilled Cheese . Blink-182 toured throughout 1995-1996 and followed up with the release of Dude Ranch in 1997 on Cargo\/MCA . Raynor was fired in the middle of the band 's 1998 tour after the band accused him of having alcohol problems . He was replaced by Travis Barker . Raynor has remained musically active since his departure from Blink-182 . From 1998 until 2003 he played guitar in the band Death On Wednesday . In 2004 he joined the bands One Track Mind and Isinglass , playing drums . In 2004 he briefly played drums with the band Trailer Park Queen .

Lindsey Jacobellis ( born August 19 , 1985 in Danbury , Connecticut ) is an American snowboarder from Stratton , Vermont . At the 2006 Winter Olympics , Jacobellis won the silver medal in Women 's Snowboard Cross 's Olympics debut . She is also a seven-time snowboard cross champion at the X Games . She has been featured in several high-profile advertising campaigns , including a Visa commercial . During the gold medal final of the Snowboard Cross at the 2006 Winter Olympics on February 17 , 2006 , Jacobellis was approaching the end of the course with a 43-meter ( 140 ft ) , three-second lead over Tanja Frieden of Switzerland . On the penultimate jump , while showboating , Jacobellis attempted a method grab , landed on the edge of her snowboard , and fell . Frieden passed her to win the gold ; Jacobellis recovered and settled for silver . In televised interviews , Jacobellis initially claimed the grab was meant to maintain stability , but later admitted that it was not necessary . She said `` Snowboarding is fun ; I was having fun . '' A year later at the 2007 Winter X Games , Jacobellis lost the lead in a fall near the finish line . She regained the gold medal in the same event at Winter X Games XII in 2008 . Jacobellis failed to progress to the medal round of Snowboard Cross at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver , as , early in her semifinal race , she landed badly during a jump , and to avoid a collision with another rider went through a gate , resulting in an automatic disqualification . She then slid off the course .
Ovule literally means `` small egg . '' In seed plants , the ovule is the structure that gives rise to and contains the female reproductive cells . It consists of three parts : The integuments forming its outer layer , the nucellus ( or megasporangium ) , and the megaspore-derived female gametophyte ( or megagametophyte ) in its center . The megagametophyte ( also called embryo sac in flowering plants ) produces the egg cell for fertilization . After fertilization , the ovule develops into a seed . In flowering plants , the ovule is located within the actual flower , the part of the carpel known as the ovary , which ultimately becomes the fruit . Depending on the plant , flowers may have one or multiple ovules per ovary . The ovules are attached to the placental wall of the ovary through a structure known as the funiculus , the plant equivalent of an umbilical cord . Different patterns of ovule attachment , or placentation , can be found among plants : In parietal placentation , the ovules are attached to the outer ovary wall , whereas in free central placentation , they are attached to a central column within the ovary . In axile placentation , they are attached to radial spokes within the ovary . In gymnosperms such as conifers and similar plants , the ovules are borne unenclosed on the surface of an ovuliferous ( ovule-bearing ) scale , usually within an ovulate cone ( also called megastrobilus ) . The ovule is composed of diploid maternal tissue that gives rise to the haploid tissue of the female gametophyte . The maternal tissues of the ovule include the integuments and the nucellus . The next `` generation '' formed within the ovule are the haploid megaspore and megagametophyte , or embryo sac . After fertilization of the egg cell and formation of a zygote , the ovule contains the embryo of the next sporophyte generation and , in flowering plants , the triploid endosperm . The integuments are the outer cell layers of the ovule enclosing the nucellus . Gymnosperms typically have one integument layer while angiosperms typically have two . The integuments develop into the seed coat when the ovule matures after fertilization . The integuments do not enclose the nucellus completely but leave an opening at its apex referred to as the micropyle . The micropyle opening allows the pollen tube to enter the ovule for fertilization . In gymnosperms ( e.g. conifers ) , the pollen itself is drawn into the ovule and the micropyle opening closes after pollination . During germination , the seedling 's radicle emerges through the micropyle . Located opposite from the micropyle is the chalaza where the nucellus is joined to the integuments . Nutrients from the plant travel through the phloem of the vascular system to the funiculus and outer integument and from there apoplastically and symplastically through the chalaza to the nucellus inside the ovule . In chalazogamous plants , the pollen tubes enter the ovule through the chalaza instead of the micropyle opening . The nucellus ( plural : nucelli ) is the central portion of the ovule inside the integuments . It consists of diploid maternal tissue and has the function of a megasporangium . In immature ovules , it contains a megasporocyte ( megaspore mother cell ) , which undergoes sporogenesis via meiosis . Three of the four haploid cells produced in meiosis degenerate , leaving one surviving megaspore inside the nucellus . After fertilization , the nucellus develops into the perisperm that feeds the embryo . In some plants , the diploid tissue of the nucellus can give rise to a seed through a mechanism of asexual reproduction called nucellar embryony . The haploid megaspore inside the nucellus gives rise to the female gametophyte ( megagametophyte ) . In gymnosperms , the female gametophyte consists of around 2000 nuclei and forms archegonia which produce the egg cells for fertilization . In flowering plants , the megagametophyte , also referred to as embryo sac , is much smaller and typically consists of only seven cells and eight nuclei . The embryo sac develops from the megaspore through three rounds of mitotic divisions . The cell closest to the micropyle opening of the integuments differentiates into the egg cell , with two synergid cells by its side that may be involved in the production of signals that guide the pollen tube . Three antipodal cells form on the opposite ( chalazal ) end of ovule and later degenerate , serving no obvious function . The large central cell of the embryo sac contains two polar nuclei . The pollen tube releases two sperm nuclei into the ovule . In gymnosperms , fertilization occurs within the archegonia produced by the female gametophyte . While it is possible that several egg cells are present and fertilized , typically only one zygote will develop into a mature embryo as the resources within the seed are limited . In flowering plants , one sperm nucleus fuses with the egg cell into a zygote , the other fuses with the two polar nuclei of the central cell to give rise to the triploid endosperm . This double fertilization is unique to flowering plants . The plant stores nutrients such as starch , proteins and oils in the endosperm as a food source for the developing embryo and seedling , serving a similar function to the yolk of animal eggs . The endosperm is also called the albumen of the seed .
Viviers ( also , Viviers-sur-Rh Ã ne ) is a commune in the department of ArdÃ che in southern France . It is a small walled city situated on the right bank of the RhÃ ne . Viviers became the capital of the Gaulish Helvii tribe following the decline of nearby Alba-la-Romaine . In late Roman times , it also became a bishopric and the capital of the pays Vivarais . Today , it is still the see of the bishop of ArdÃ che .
Tiko , Originally called â Kekaâ by the Bakweris , is a town and important port in the southwest region of Cameroon . The settlement grew as a market town for Duala ( or Douala ) fishermen , Bakweri ( Kpwe people ) farmers and hunters from Molyko , Bwenga , Bulu and Bokova . The core quarters in Tiko include Streets 1 to 7 , Motombolombo , Down Beach , New Quarter , P&T quarters , New Layout , Long Street , Likomba , Golf Club , Mutengene , Ombe . As of 2010 , the town is estimated to have a population of 55,914 . Tiko is a popular destination for tourists visiting Cameroon . The town is also an industrial area which is mostly occupied by the CDC ( Cameroon Development Co-operation ) , which produces rubber , banana , and palm oil . Tiko hosts the Tiko Golf Club , which is a popular destination for golf lovers . The Likomba Golf Course is located in Likomba which has 18 holes . During the dry season , major golf tournaments are held there , as it is one of only 2 golf courses in Cameroon . Tiko also hosts the special forces , which explains the peace and security enjoyed by the inhabitants . Mutengene , a small town west of Tiko , is a cross roads leading to Buea and Limbe , Cameroon ( Formerly called Victoria ) . Tiko is home to many colleges , including Christ the King College , GBHS , Imperial Academy of Arts and Science ( IMPASS ) , Sure Foundation Comprehensive College , and Plive College . There are two major hotels . Airport Hotel , which derived its name from the Tiko airport , is located on Long Street . This hotel was built in the early 70s . It used to have a very popular nightclub which attracted folks and musicians not only from within but also from out of Cameroon . 3813 is the second of the two hotels . It was built around the year 2002 and is located along the Tiko-Douala road . It has a supermarket , a swimming pool and a night club for dancing . Internet access is also available . Tiko is well known for its Nigerian ( Igbo people ) population , as well as its organized marketplace . The Tiko Market is one of the most renowned markets in West Africa . People traveled from surrounding villages , cities , and countries to shop or conduct business in Tiko . The market is currently being rebuilt after a fire destroyed the shops on the 2nd of March 2010 . Tiko United FC is Tiko 's most famous football club . Tiko United is the first club west of the Mongo to have won the championship title since its inception some 50 years ago . Plantations in the Tiko area were originally served by narrow gauge plantation railways .
A propulsor is a mechanical device that gives propulsion . The word is commonly used in the marine vernacular , and implies a mechanical assembly that is more complicated than a propeller . The Kort nozzle and Pump-jet are examples . A propulsor , as the one that can be seen in the accompanying picture , has a shroud , which cuts down on blade-tip cavitation and radiated noise . It also has a rotor element and a stator . The stator concentrates the thrust in axial direction and reduces energy wasted in the tangential flow ( therefore eliminating torque on the hull ) . The number of blades in the rotor & stator will typically be odd-numbered , and different prime numbers to avoid standing waves . The blades in the rotor or the stator may be angled to further reduce noise . The physical design and layout is very much similar to a single stage Axial-flow compressor . The Voith Schneider propeller ( VSP ) , also known as a cycloidal drive ( CD ) is a specialized marine propulsion system ( MPS ) . It is highly manoeuvrable , being able to change the direction of its thrust almost instantaneously . It is widely used on tugs and ferries . From a circular plate , rotating around a vertical axis , a circular array of vertical blades ( in the shape of hydrofoils ) protrude out of the bottom of the ship . Each blade can rotate itself around a vertical axis . The internal gear changes the angle of attack of the blades in sync with the rotation of the plate , so that each blade can provide thrust in any direction , very similar to the collective pitch control and cyclic in a helicopter . An azimuth thruster is a configuration of ship propellers placed in pods that can be rotated in any horizontal direction , making a rudder unnecessary . These give ships better maneuverability than a fixed propeller and rudder system . A magnetohydrodynamic drive or MHD propulsor is a method for propelling seagoing vessels using only electric and magnetic fields with no moving parts , using magnetohydrodynamics . The working principle involves electrification of the propellant ( gas or water ) which can then be directed by a magnetic field , pushing the vehicle in the opposite direction . Although some working prototypes exist , MHD drives remain impractical and exist mostly in the world of science fiction .
Torvosaurus is a genus of large theropod dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period ( mid-late Kimmeridgian stage in North America , early Tithonian stage in Europe ) . The name Torvosaurus means `` savage lizard '' and is derived from the Latin torvus ( `` savage '' ) and the Greek Ï Î Ï Ï Î Ï \/ sauros ( `` lizard '' ) . Fossilized remains of Torvosaurus have been found in North America and Portugal . Torvosaurus reached 9 to 11 meters ( 30 to 36 ft ) in length and an estimated weight of about 2 metric tons ( 2.2 tons ) , which made it the largest carnivore of its time , except for Epanterias ( which may have been just a big Allosaurus ) and Saurophaganax . It was first discovered by James A. Jensen and Kenneth Stadtman in the rocks of the Morrison Formation at the Dry Mesa Quarry , Colorado in 1972 . The genus and the type species T. tanneri were named and described in 1979 by Peter M. Galton and Jensen . The type specimen from Colorado was further described by Brooks Britt , and the Portuguese specimen by O. Mateus and M.T. Antunes . The holotype is represented by an upper arm bone ( humerus ) and lower arm bones ( radius and ulna ) . Additional material includes some skull bones , back bones , hip bones and ` hand ' bones . Torvosaurus is related to the earlier Megalosaurus but is seemingly more advanced . Its classification is still uncertain but its family Megalosauridae is most commonly held as a basal branch of Tetanurae , less derived than carnosaurs or coelurosaurs , and likely related to the spinosaurids . The size of Torvosaurus is not definitely known because only incomplete material has been found , but it was a large theropod . North American Torvosaurus material is estimated as belonging to an individual about 9.0 meters long ( 29 ft ) , with a weight of about 1.95 metric tons ( 2.15 tons ) . Material from Portugal indicates even larger animals . In 2006 a nearly complete maxilla found in Portugal was assigned to Torvosaurus tanneri . It measured 63 cm in length ( 2.13 ft ) , significantly larger than the 47 cm ( 1.54 ft ) long maxilla of the American specimen ( total skull length 118 cm ( 3.87 ft ) ) . Based on this , a skull length of 158 cm ( 5.18 ft ) was estimated for the Portuguese specimen . This is comparable to the largest T. rex skulls , and makes Torvosaurus the largest known Jurassic theropod ( surpassing Saurophaganax\/Allosaurus maximus and Edmarka ) , and among the largest of all theropods . A partial femur from another individual belongs to an animal estimated as 11 m ( 36 ft ) long .
Saint-Biez-en-Belin is a commune in the Sarthe department in the region of Pays-de-la-Loire in north-western France . Saint-Calais is a commune in the Sarthe department in the region of Pays-de-la-Loire in north-western France . Prior to the French Revolution it was known for its Benedictine abbey named after the Anisola stream ( modern Aniole , a tributary of the Braye ) . Saint-Calais is a later name coming from one of the local saints of the Perche area . William of St. Calais , a product of this monastery , was a post-conquest bishop of Durham . There are no remains of the Abbey , which was a principal land-owner in the vicinity . The existing parish church has a fine Renaissance facade . The Aniole was dammed by the monks , thereby retaining a significant lake area . Reaction against monastic landowners and the relative proximity to Paris ( under twenty-four hours by stage-coach ) conditioned the nineteenth century politics of the town . The coming of the railways and more recently of the motorway favored neighbouring La FertÃ - Bernard which has grown at the expense of Saint-Calais , which has a population under 4000 and which lost its sous-pr Ã fecture status in 1926 . The town however retains certain services appropriate to that level , e.g. hospital facilities .
Prospero is a relatively small retrograde irregular satellite of Uranus discovered on 18 July 1999 by the astrophysicist Matthew Holman and his team , and given the provisional designation S\/1999 U 3 . Confirmed as Uranus XVIII it was named after the sorcerer Prospero in William Shakespeare 's play The Tempest . The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong to the same dynamic cluster as Sycorax and Setebos , suggesting common origin . However , this suggestion does not appear to be supported by the observed colors . The satellite appears neutral ( gray ) in visible light ( color indices B-V = 0.80 , R-V = 0.39 ) , similar to Setebos but different from Sycorax ( which is light red ) .
Anchorage is a city in eastern Jefferson County . The population was 2,264 at the 2000 census . The land that is now Anchorage was a part of Isaac Hite 's 1773 land grant , which awarded most of the land in today 's Jefferson county to officers in the Virginia militia , in exchange for their service in the French and Indian War . Early maps refer to the area as Hite 's Mill . Part of his original grant now makes up the grounds of Central State Hospital and E. P. `` Tom '' Sawyer State Park . The nautical name is a bit odd , considering the city is over twelve miles from the Ohio River . The origin is The Anchorage , home of riverboat captain and early resident James W. Goslee , and was chosen to honor him when the city incorporated in 1878 , three years after his death . Tradition says that an anchor hanging inside the rim of a locomotive wheel at the center of town was taken by Goslee from his ship , the Matamora . The Louisville and Frankfort Railroad ( later purchased by the Louisville & Nashville Railroad ) was built through the area in 1849 . The development of an interurban rail line in 1901 allowed faster travel between Anchorage and Louisville , as well as other towns in the area . The heavily shaded city , with temperatures often noticeably cooler than in Downtown Louisville , became a popular location for summer homes for wealthy Louisvillians . One such resident was brewing magnate Isaac Wolfe Bernheim , still remembered locally for his philanthropy . In 1914 , Bernheim commissioned the firm of Frederick Law Olmsted to design a plan for Anchorage , which would incorporate stone bridges and triangle intersections , similar to Olmsted 's plans for Louisville 's park system . The city has long been known as home of some of the area 's wealthiest citizens , though the large old estates have mostly been divided up and many new , still upscale , houses have been built in the area , especially since 1977 . Part of the city is designated as the Anchorage Historic District , which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 . Papa John 's Pizza founder John Schnatter is a resident and owns about 6 % of the land in Anchorage , including much of the city center . He restored an interurban rail station , three historic buildings and built a fourth in a similar style in the city 's center , with plans to build a bank , an upscale restaurant , and a hiking trail , which opened as the Anchorage Trail in June 2008 . In an interview , he told the Courier-Journal that his goal was purely to `` preserve the city 's character '' . Anchorage is located at ( 38.265370 , -85.537571 ) . According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 3.0 square miles ( 7.9 kmÂ ) , of which , 3.0 square miles ( 7.9 kmÂ ) of it is land and 0.33 % is water . As of the census of 2000 , there were 2,264 people , 729 households , and 643 families residing in the city . The population density was 744.0 people per square mile ( 287.5 \/ kmÂ ) . There were 750 housing units at an average density of 246.5 \/ sq mi ( 95.3 \/ kmÂ ) . The racial makeup of the city was 97.13 % White , 0.84 % Black or African American , 1.33 % Asian , 0.27 % from other races , and 0.44 % from two or more races . Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.75 % of the population . There were 729 households out of which 52.4 % had children under the age of 18 living with them , 81.9 % were married couples living together , 3.7 % had a female householder with no husband present , and 11.7 % were non-families . 10.6 % of all households were made up of individuals and 4.8 % had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older . The average household size was 3.09 and the average family size was 3.33 . In the city the population was spread out with 35.0 % under the age of 18 , 4.0 % from 18 to 24 , 20.8 % from 25 to 44 , 32.2 % from 45 to 64 , and 8.0 % who were 65 years of age or older . The median age was 40 years . For every 100 females there were 99.1 males . For every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 95.5 males . The median income for a household in the city was $ 133,969 , and the median income for a family was $ 147,050 . Males had a median income of $ 100,000 versus $ 47,188 for females . The per capita income for the city was $ 63,988 . About 1.1 % of families and 1.87 % of the population were below the poverty line , including 1.2 % of those under age 18 and 2.5 % of those age 65 or over .
Reformism is the belief that gradual democratic changes in a society can ultimately change a society 's fundamental economic relations and political structures . This belief grew out of opposition to revolutionary socialism , which contends that revolutions are necessary to fundamentally change a society . Socialist reformism , or evolutionary socialism , was first put forward by Eduard Bernstein , a leading social democrat . Reformism was quickly targeted by revolutionary socialists , with Rosa Luxemburg condemning Bernstein 's Evolutionary Socialism in her 1900 essay Reform or Revolution ? . While Luxemburg died in the German Revolution , the reformists soon found themselves contending with the Bolsheviks and their satellite communist parties for the support of the proletariat . After the Bolsheviks won the Russian Civil War and consolidated power in the Soviet Union , they launched a targeted campaign against the Reformist movement by denouncing them as `` social fascists '' . Arthur Koestler , a former member of the Communist Party of Germany , the largest communist party in Western Europe in the Interwar period , confessed in The God that Failed that communists aligned with the Soviet Union continued to consider the `` social fascist '' Social Democratic Party of Germany to be the real enemy in Germany , even after the Nazi Party had usurped power . In modern times , Reformists are seen as centre-left . Some social democratic parties , such as the Canadian NDP and the Social Democratic Party of Germany , are still considered to be reformist . The term was applied to elements within the British Labor Party in the 1950s and subsequently , on the party 's right . Anthony Crosland wrote The Future of Socialism ( 1956 ) as a personal manifesto arguing for a reformulation of the term . For Crosland , the relevance of nationalization ( or public ownership ) for socialists was much reduced as a consequence of contemporary full employment , Keynesian management of the economy and reduced capitalist exploitation . In 1960 , after the third successive defeat of his party in the 1959 General Election Hugh Gaitskell attempted to reformulate the original wording of Clause IV in the party 's constitution , but proved unsuccessful . Some of the younger followers of Gaitskell , principally Roy Jenkins , Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams left the Labor Party in 1981 to found the Social Democratic Party , but the central objective of the Gaitskellites was eventually achieved by Tony Blair in his successful attempt to rewrite Clause IV in 1995 . The use of the term is distinguished from the gradualism associated with Fabianism ( the ideology of the Fabian Society ) , which itself should not be seen as being in parallel with the revisionism associated Bernstein and the German SPD , as originally the Fabians had explicitly rejected Marxism .
A payment is the transfer of wealth from one party ( such as a person or company ) to another . A payment is usually made in exchange for the provision of goods , services or both , or to fulfill a legal obligation . The simplest and oldest form of payment is barter , the exchange of one good or service for another . In the modern world , common means of payment by an individual include money , cheque , debit , credit , or bank transfer , and in trade such payments are frequently preceded by an invoice or result in a receipt . However , there are no arbitrary limits on the form a payment can take and thus in complex transactions between businesses , payments may take the form of stock or other more complicated arrangements . In law , the payer is the party making a payment while the payee is the party receiving the payment . There are two types of payment methods ; exchanging and provisioning . Exchanging is to change coin , money and banknote in terms of the price . Provisioning is to transfer money from one account to another . In this method a third party must be involved . Credit card , debit card , money transfers , and recurring cash or ACH ( Automated Clearing House ) disbursements are all electronic payments methods . Electronic payments technologies are magnetic stripe card , smartcard , contactless card and mobile handset . Mobile handset based payments are called mobile payments . Payments may be classified by the number of parties involved to consummate a transaction . For example , a credit card transaction in the United States requires a minimum of four parties ( the purchaser , the seller , the issuing bank , and the acquiring bank ) . A cash payment requires a minimum of three parties ( the seller , the purchaser , and the issuer of the currency ) . A barter payment requires a minimum of two parties ( the purchaser and the seller ) . The infrastructure and electronic clearing methods are formed by the payment provider . Global credit card payment providers are Visa and Mastercard . Japan Credit Bureau ( JCB ) is a payment provider for Japanese market . Maestro and Cirrus are international debit card payment providers . In 2005 , an estimated $ 40 trillion globally passed through some type of payment system . Roughly $ 12 trillion of that was transacted through various credit cards , mostly the 21,000 member banks of Visa and MasterCard . Processing payments , including the extending of credit , produced close to $ 500 billion in revenue . In the U.S. , debit cards are the fastest growing payment technology . In 2001 , debit cards accounted for 9 percent of all purchase transactions , and this is expected to double to 18.82 percent in 2011 Historically , checks have been one of the primary means of payment for purchasing goods and services in the U.S. . In 2001 , checks accounted for 25 percent of the U.S.-based payment mix ; in 2006 , this is projected at 17 percent . In the USA , a check as a form of payment can legally be refused for any reason ( or no reason ) . Simply put : A payment via check is not a `` payment '' until the check was cashed and clears the banks . Example : You can not order a fast food meal , throw a check on the counter and just leave with the meal , if they do not accept your payment via check , you would be committing larceny by taking the meal . For tax purposes , it is important to determine the timing of actual payment and whether it qualifies as a deduction in a taxpayer 's calculation of taxable income . Cash payments occur at the time of payment . This is the easy case , but payments in other forms can be trickier . Payment also occurs when the taxpayer transfers property or performs services in lieu of making a cash payment . Payment by check is deemed to occur when the check is delivered , as long as the check is honored on presentation by the payee . This rule is enforced even where presentation does not occur until the next taxable year , and even though the taxpayer could stop payment on the check in the meantime . Postdated checks , however , are not considered payment when delivered . Generally , payment by credit card occurs at the point of the sale and not when the taxpayer is billed by the credit card company or when the taxpayer pays the bill .
New World monkeys are the five families of primates that are found in Central and South America : Callitrichidae , Cebidae , Aotidae , Pitheciidae , and Atelidae . The five families are ranked together as the Platyrrhini parvorder and the Ceboidea superfamily , which are essentially synonymous since Ceboidea is the only living platyrrhine superfamily . They differ from other groupings of monkeys and primates , such as the Old World monkeys and the apes . New World monkeys are small to mid-sized primates , ranging from the Pygmy Marmoset ( the world 's smallest monkey ) , at 14 to 16 cm ( 5.5 to 6.3 in ) and a weight of 120 to 190 grams ( 4.2 to 6.7 oz ) to the Southern Muriqui , at 55 to 70 cm ( 22 to 28 in ) and a weight of 12 to 15 kg ( 26 to 33 lbs ) . New World monkeys differ slightly from Old World monkeys in several aspects . The most prominent phenotype distinction is the nose , which is the feature used most commonly to distinguish between the two groups . The scientific name for the New World monkeys , Platyrrhini , means `` flat nosed '' . The noses of New World monkeys are flatter than the narrow noses of the Old World monkeys , and have side-facing nostrils . New World monkeys are the only monkeys with prehensile tailsâ '' in comparison with the shorter , non-grasping tails of the anthropoids of the Old World . New World monkeys ( except for the howler monkeys of genus Alouatta ) also typically lack the trichromatic vision of Old World monkeys . Colour vision in New World primates relies on a single gene on the X-chromosome to produce pigments that absorb medium and long wavelength light , which contrasts with short wavelength light . As a result , males rely on a single medium\/long pigment gene and are dichromatic , as are homozygous females . Heterozygous females may possess two alleles with different sensitivities within this range , and so can display trichromatic vision . Platyrrhines also differ from Old World monkeys in that they have twelve premolars instead of eight ; having a dental formula of 2:1:3:3 ( consisting of 2 incisors , 1 canine , 3 premolars , and 3 molars . This is in contrast with Old World Anthropoids , including humans , gorillas , chimps , bonobos , siamangs , gibbons and orangutans , which share a dental formula of 2:1:2:3 . ) New World monkeys in the family Atelidae are the only primates with tails that are prehensile . Many New World monkeys are small and almost all are arboreal , so knowledge of them is less comprehensive than that of the more easily observed Old World monkeys . Unlike most Old World monkeys , many New World monkeys form monogamous pair bonds , and show substantial paternal care of young . They eat fruits , nuts , insects , flowers , bird eggs , spiders , and small mammals . Unlike humans and most Old World monkeys , their thumbs are not opposable ( except for some Cebids ) . About 40 million years ago the Simiiformes infraorder split into parvorders Platyrrhini ( New World monkeysâ '' in South America ) and Catarrhini ( apes and Old World monkeysâ '' in Africa ) . The Platyrrhini are currently conjectured to have migrated across the Atlantic Ocean to South America on a raft of vegetation . At that time , the Isthmus of Panama had not yet formed , ocean currents and climate were quite different , and the Atlantic Ocean was less than the present 2800 k width by about a third ; possibly 1,000 km less , based on the current estimate of the Atlantic mid-ocean ridge formation processes spreading rate of 25 mm\/year .
The Indian Skipper Frog or Skittering Frog ( Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis ) is a common frog found in South Asia . They are slimy and are often seen at the edge of bodies of water with their eyes above the water . They noisily move away from the shore when disturbed , giving them their common name . They are rarely seen outside water . Vomerine teeth in two small oblique series extending a little beyond the hinder edge of the choanae . Head moderate ; snout scarcely pointed ; canthus rostralis indistinct ; interorbital space much narrower than the upper eyelid ; tympanum distinct , about two thirds the size of the eye . Fingers slender , pointed , first not extending beyond second ; toes webbed to the tips , which are pointed , fourth not much longer than third or fifth ; outer toe strongly fringed ; subarticular tubercles small ; inner metatarsal tubercle small , conical , much like a rudimentary toe . The tibio-tarsal articulation usually reaches a little beyond the eye . Skin with small tubercles and units above , and with more or less distinct rows of pores . Brown or olive above , dark spotted or marbled ; two blackish streaks on the hinder side of the thighs , seldom absent ; beneath often speckled with blackish . Male with two external vocal vesicles , opening by two slits beneath the angles of the mouth . They have the ability to leap out of the water from a floating position . Cross section of the phalange bones shows annual growth rings which may be used for determining age . The species is widely distributed from Arabia to South Asia and South-east Asia . The microhabitat in which this frog is found is pools of stagnant water .
Ottmar Walter ( born March 6 , 1924 ) is a former German footballer . He played together with his brother , Fritz Walter , at the club 1 . FC Kaiserslautern . They also played together for the Germany national football team in the 1954 FIFA World Cup . Ottmar scored 4 goals in the tournament as West Germany won their first ever World Cup title . In total , Ottmar earned 20 caps and scored 10 goals for Germany . For his club 1 . FC Kaiserslautern he scored unequaled 336 goals in 321 league and cup matches . Ottmar Walter debuted in the first team at the age of 18 in 1942 as an outside left in a 7:1 rout of 1 . FC Kaiserslautern against SV Waldhof Mannheim . During World War II , Walter was drafted into the Kriegsmarine and suffered heavy injuries in his right knee . After several operations , he was forced to end his career in 1958 . By the late-1940s , Ottmar Walter was the center forward of 1 . FC Kaiserslautern . Like his brother Fritz , he treated the ball elegantly and was also pacy and possessed a powerful shot . As a center forward he also often moved to the wing . After the end of his career he concentrated on operating a gas station which he had took at rent in 1954 . When the contract was signed , Walter had read over the fine print in the contract which determined that if the contract got withdrawn , the gas station and the goods on the ground of the gas station would subrogate to the new leaseholder . This happened in 1969 and in consequence of this Ottmar Walter tried to commit suicide . However he survived and later described that attempted suicide as a `` panic reaction '' . Later Walter found a job as an employee of the city of Kaiserslautern .
Class 316 and Class 457 were TOPS classifications assigned to a single electric multiple unit ( EMU ) at different stages of its use as a prototype for the Networker series . In the late 1980s , the Network SouthEast division of British Rail , which operated the railway network in South East England , started to develop a new standard train , known as the Networker . To test out the technical arrangements for the Networker , a test train was used , converted from former Class 210 carriages , which were the prototype ` Second Generation ' Diesel Electric Multiple Unit ( DEMU ) , but which never entered fleet service . Initially the test unit was formed for trials on the 750 V direct current ( DC ) third rail system of the Southern Region , and was numbered 457001 . As with all Southern Region electric multiple units only the last four digits of the unit number were actually carried . Later , the unit was altered to undertake trials on the 25kV alternating current ( AC ) overhead wire system used on electrified lines north of the River Thames . The unit was renumbered as a Class 316 unit , number 316999 . To enable it to work on the AC electrification , a pantograph trailer from a Class 313 unit 313034 ( 313134 ) was inserted into the set , replacing one of the intermediate trailers . This spare vehicle ( no. 67400 ) has since been incorporated into a Class 455\/9 DC suburban unit , replacing a damaged Trailer Second Open ( TSO ) vehicle . Note : The Class 316 designation was also used in 1992 for a three car Class 307 EMU used as a testbed unit for new traction equipment . After the AC trials were complete , the set was returned to the Southern Region for storage , minus the Class 313 trailer , which returned to its previous formation . One of the two driving cards have now been preserved at the Coventry Railway Centre , the other is a spare body shell stored for HSBC Rail while the remaining intermediate trailer has been scrapped .
Ham-en-Artois is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France . A farming village , situated some 9 m northwest of BÃ thune and 28 m west of Lille , at the junction of the D91 and the D94 roads . Two small streams flow through the commune : the Guarbecque and the Fauquethun .
Luna 2 ( E-1A series ) was the second of the Soviet Union 's Luna program spacecraft launched to the Moon . It was the first spacecraft to reach the surface of the Moon . It successfully impacted with the lunar surface east of Mare Serenitatis near the craters Aristides , Archimedes , and Autolycus . Luna 2 was similar in design to Luna 1 , a spherical spacecraft with protruding antennae and instrument parts . The instrumentation was also similar , including scintillation counters , geiger counters , a magnetometer , Cherenkov detectors , and micrometeorite detectors . There were no propulsion systems on Luna 2 itself . Luna 2 showed time variations in the electron flux and energy spectrum in the Van Allen radiation belt . Luna 2 was instrumented with a three component fluxgate magnetometer , similar to that used on Luna 1 , but with the dynamic range reduced by a factor of 4 to -750 to +750 nanoteslas ( gammas ) so that the quantization uncertainty was -12 to +12 nT . The spacecraft spin period was 840 seconds about the major axis , and there was a precession with a period of 86 seconds . The sampling rate of the instrument was approximately once per minute . According to the Principal Investigator , the errors associated with the experiment zero levels and spacecraft fields were such that the accuracy was approximately 50 to 100 nT . The spacecraft gave results similar to those of Luna 1 in the Earth 's radiation belts and , upon impact , placed an upper limit of 100 nT on the lunar magnetic field at the surface . The spacecraft also carried Soviet pennants . Two of them , located in the spacecraft , were sphere-shaped , with the surface covered by identical pentagonal elements . In the center of this sphere was an explosive for the purpose of slowing the huge impact velocity . This was designed as a very simple way to provide the last necessary delta-v for those elements on the retro side of the sphere to not get vaporized . Each pentagonal element was made of stainless steel and had the USSR Coat of Arms and the Cyrillic letters Ð Ð Ð Ð ( Russian ; it translates into English as USSR ) relief engraved on one side , and the words Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð cents Ð Ð ` Ð Ð 1959 ( English : USSR SEPTEMBER 1959 ) relief engraved on the other side . The third pennant was located in the last stage of the Luna 2 rocket , which collided with the moon 's surface 30 minutes after the spacecraft did . It was a capsule filled with liquid , with aluminium strips placed into it . On each of these strips the USSR Coat of Arms , the words 1959 Ð Ð Ð Ð cents Ð Ð ` Ð Ð ( English : 1959 SEPTEMBER ) and the words Ð Ð Ð Ð -- Ð Ð Ð ' Ð Ð cents Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð cents Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð Ð # Ð ` Ð Ð Ð ( English : UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS ) were engraved . On September 15 , 1959 , the premier of the USSR , Nikita Khrushchev , presented to the American president Dwight D. Eisenhower a copy of the spherical pennant as a gift . That sphere is located at the Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum in Abilene Kansas . The only other known copy of the spherical pennant is located at the Kansas Cosmosphere in Hutchinson , Kansas .
Spree-Nei Ã e is a Kreis ( district ) in the southern part of Brandenburg , Germany . Neighboring districts are ( from the south clockwise ) the districts Niederschlesischer Oberlausitzkreis and Kamenz in Saxony , the districts Oberspreewald-Lausitz , Dahme-Spreewald and Oder-Spree . The district-free city Cottbus is completely surrounded by the district . To the east is Poland . The district is located in the region of Lusatia . The Spree river runs through the district , while the Lusatian Neisse river forms the eastern border , which is at the same time the border of Poland . The district was created in 1993 by merging the previous districts Cottbus-Land , Forst , Guben and Spremberg .
Brown is a color term , denoting a range of composite colors produced by a mixture of orange , red , rose , or yellow with black or gray . The term is from Old English brÃ n , in origin for any dusky or dark shade of color . The Common Germanic adjective \* brÃ '' noz , \* brÃ '' nÃ cents meant both dark colors and a glistening or shining quality , whence burnish . The current meaning developed in Middle English from the 14th century . The adjective is applied to naturally occurring colors , referring to animal fur , human hair , human skin pigmentation ( tans ) , partially charred or carbonized fiber as in toasted bread and other foods , peat , withered leaves , etc. In terms of the visible spectrum , `` brown '' refers to high wavelength ( low frequency ) hues , yellow , orange , or red , in combination with low luminance or saturation . Since brown may cover a wide range of the visible spectrum , composite adjectives are used such as red brown , yellowish brown , dark brown or light brown . As a color of low intensity , brown is a tertiary color : a mix of the three subtractive primary colors is brown if the cyan content is low . Brown exists as a color perception only in the presence of a brighter color contrast : yellow , orange , red , or rose objects are still perceived as such if the general illumination level is low , despite reflecting the same amount of red or orange light as a brown object would in normal lighting conditions . The first recorded use of brown as a color name in English was in 1000 . The web color called `` brown '' is displayed at right . The historical and traditional name for this color is red-brown . The color shown above at the top right at the head of this article ( color # 964B00 ) is the color normally and traditionally regarded as brown -- a medium dark orange . Its h ( hue ) code is 30 , which signifies a shade of orange . The color to the immediate right ( color # A52A2A ) that was chosen as the web color `` brown '' -- a medium dark redâ '' is the color traditionally called red-brown . That this color is a shade of red and not orange can be easily ascertained by inspecting its h ( hue ) code , which is 0 , signifying a shade of red . The first recorded use of red-brown as a color name in English was in 1682 . The color dark brown is displayed at right . The color pale brown is displayed at right .

Karel PoborskÃ 1\/2 ( born 30 March 1972 in TÅ eboÅ ) is a former Czech footballer . A right winger , PoborskÃ 1\/2 is the all-time leader in appearances for the Czech national team , and was most noted for his technical ability . PoborskÃ 1\/2 began playing professionally with S.K. Dynamo Ä eskÃ BudÄ jovice , FK Viktoria Å 1\/2 iÅ 3\/4 kov and SK Slavia Praha ( the season Patrik Berger left for Borussia Dortmund ) . In July 1996 , PoborskÃ 1\/2 signed with Manchester United but , due to David Beckham 's rising stardom , would only manage one-and-a-half seasons at Old Trafford . He did collect a Premier League title winner 's medal in the 1996 â `` 97 season , however , playing in 22 out of 38 league games and scoring three goals , also helping United reach the Champions League semi-finals . In January 1998 , he left for Portuguese Liga side Benfica , where he was at his best form , playing alongside JoÃ # o Vieira Pinto , and became an instant hit and a fan favorite . After a string of impressive performances , PoborskÃ 1\/2 moved sides in January 2001 , joining Serie A 's Lazio .

PoborskÃ 1\/2 's first international appearance , against Turkey on 23 February 1994 , was also the first match for the Czech team after the partition of Czechoslovakia . He played for his country at Euro 96 , where he was one of the most valuable players of Czech team and even the whole tournament , scoring there his well-known `` PoborskÃ 1\/2 lob '' , Euro 2000 , and Euro 2004 , and was also in the nation 's squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup , where his performances was far below , due to his age and contract with SK Dynamo Ä eskÃ BudÄ jovice , which played `` only '' Czech 2 . Liga . After 2006 FIFA World Cup PoborskÃ 1\/2 retired from international competition . Following his 2007 club retirement , PoborskÃ 1\/2 started working as a technical leader for the national team . PoborskÃ 1\/2 's name is often attached to his performance in Euro 96 , where during the quarter-final match against Portugal , he chipped the ball and lobbed it over the advancing VÃ tor BaÃ a. The goal became a trademark shot for PoborskÃ 1\/2 , as that shooting style was soon attributed to him . In 2008 , it was voted the best individual goal in the Carlsberg goal of the day poll on Euro2008 . com . As a club player , PoborskÃ 1\/2 scored a similar goal against FC Porto ( again with VÃ tor BaÃ a as the goalkeeper ) while at Benfica . Scores and results list Czech Republic 's goal tally first .

Sancti SpÃ ritus is one of the provinces of Cuba . Its capital is the identically named Sancti SpÃ ritus . Another major city is Trinidad . The southern coast of the province is flat , but the western portion of Sancti SpÃ ritus province is mountainous . The southeast has numerous mangroves and swamps . The northern coast contains significant wetlands and protected areas such as the Bay of Buena Vista and the Caguanes National Park . The largest man made reservoir in Cuba , the Embalse Zaza , is in Sancti SpÃ ritus province . During the 17th century , both Dutch and British pirates attempted to take control of what is today Sancti SpÃ ritus province , but with little success , as the Spanish garrison held them off . From 1660 to 1680 , Trinidad was plagued by pirates from Jamaica and Tortuga , and on two occasions , pirates razed the city . The provinces of Cienfuegos , Sancti SpÃ ritus , and Villa Clara were once all part of the now defunct province of Las Villas . Tourism is a big earner for the province , with most of the tourism centred around the old city of Trinidad , a World Heritage listed city which has dozens of colonial buildings ( and almost no 20th century architecture ) dating back to the Spanish conquest in the 16th century . Francisco Iznaga , a rich Basque landowner in the western portion of Cuba during the first 30 years of the colonization of Cuba , was elected Mayor of Bayamo in 1540 . Iznaga was the originator of a powerful lineage that finally settled in Sancti Spiritus and Trinidad , the location of the Torre Iznaga . His descendants fought for the Independence of Cuba and the Annexation to the US from 1820 to 1900 . In the area , as with most of Cuba , sugarcane and cattle are important commodities . Large surfaces are irrigated in the farmland between Zaza Reservoir , Zaza River and Jatibonico River in La Sierpe region . Some tobacco and rice is also grown . Source : Population from 2004 Census . Area from 1976 municipal re-distribution . In 2004 , the province of Sancti Spiritus had a population of 463,009 . With a total area of , the province had a population density of .
Tim Borowski ( born 2 May 1980 in Neubrandenburg ) is a German footballer , who currently plays as a midfielder for Werder Bremen . He is a central midfielder , adept at tackling and attacking although best known for his passing and vision . Borowski started his career at his hometown-club Post Neubrandenburg . There , he was scouted by Werder Bremen and became a part of the club 's youth academy that , in recent history , has also brought up players such as Nelson Valdez ( now with Borussia Dortmund ) , Christian Schulz ( now with Hannover 96 ) and Simon Rolfes ( now with Bayer Leverkusen ) . After playing for Werder Bremen II in the Regionalliga Nord , he finally became part of the senior squad in 2002 . He had been a regular since joining the main squad . As Werder Bremen usually deployed a 4 â `` 4 â `` 2 diamond formation , he usually played as a left midfielder . Borowski joined the defending Bundesliga champions on a free transfer . He wore shirt number twenty four for Bayern Munich . Borowski made 26 appearances , but never managed to establish himself in the starting eleven . After only one year with Bayern , Borowski returned to Werder Bremen on 22 July 2009 and signed a three-year contract with his former club . His first international match for Germany was a 2 â `` 2 draw against Bulgaria in Sofia on 21 August 2002 . Tim Borowski was selected for the 2006 World Cup . In the first match against Costa Rica , he played the role of attacking midfielder instead of captain Michael Ballack who was not available for the first match . After the game , he became an ever present substitute for the team and usually substituted for Bastian Schweinsteiger or Torsten Frings . In the quarter-final against Argentina , he made a superb assistance for his then Bremen teammate Miroslav Klose to score the equalizing goal for Germany . Borowski scored with the decisive fourth penalty in Germany 's 4 â `` 2 win in the shootout after extra time . After the strong appearance in the previous match , he played from the beginning in the semi-finals against Italy . Later in that match , Schweinsteiger replaced him after Borowski picked up an injury , and was not able to play in the third place play-off against Portugal . He has a higher commercial school qualification . He married Lena MÃ 1\/4 hlbacher on 15 July 2006 at the manor-house in Osterholz-Scharmbeck . They have one child , Emilia ( born 22 July 2007 ) .
The 1928 Summer Olympics , officially known as the Games of the IX Olympiad , was an international multi-sport event which was celebrated in 1928 in Amsterdam , Netherlands . Amsterdam had bid for the 1920 and 1924 Olympic Games , but had to give way to war-victim Antwerp , Belgium and Pierre de Coubertin 's Paris , respectively . The only other candidate city for the 1928 Games was Los Angeles , which would host the Olympics four years later . The United States Olympic Committee measured the costs and revenue of the 1928 Games in preparation for the 1932 Summer Olympics . The committee reported a total cost of US$ 1.183 million with receipts of US$ 1.165 million for a loss of US$ 18,000 - much less than that of the previous Games . Frederik van Tuyll van Serooskerken first proposed Amsterdam as host city for the Summer Olympic Games in 1912 , even before the Netherlands Olympic Committee was established . In 1916 , the Olympic Games were canceled due to World War I. In 1919 , the Netherlands Olympic Committee abandoned the proposal of Amsterdam in favor of their support of the nomination of Antwerp as host city for the 1920 Summer Olympics . In 1921 , the city of Paris was selected for the 1924 Summer Olympics on the condition that the 1928 Summer Olympics would be organized in Amsterdam . This decision , supported by the Netherlands Olympic Committee , was announced by the International Olympic Committee on June 2 , 1921 . The decision was disputed by the Americans , but their request to allocate the 1928 Summer Olympics to Los Angeles was without success in 1922 and again in 1923 . Los Angeles was eventually selected as host city for the 1932 Summer Olympics . During the Summer Olympics , there were 15 sports and 109 events in the tournament . In parentheses is the number of events per sport . Women 's athletics and gymnastics debuted at these Olympics , in spite of criticism . Halina Konopacka of Poland became the first female Olympic track and field champion . The 800 metre run ended with several of the competitors being completely exhausted , so running events for women longer than 200 metres were not included in the Olympics until the 1960s . Tennis disappeared from the program , only to reappear in 1968 as a demonstration sport . These Games also included art competitions , which the IOC no longer considers as official medal events . A total of 46 nations were represented at the Amsterdam Games . Malta , Panama , and Rhodesia ( now Zimbabwe ) competed at the Olympic Games for the first time . Germany returned after having been deliberately not invited in 1920 and 1924 . These are the top ten nations that won medals at these Games . The official poster for the Games was designed by Jos Rovers , and 10,000 copies were made . The poster displays a running man in a white shirt , with in the background the Olympic stadium and the Olympic flag ( shown above ) . The IOC never succeeded in getting the copyright of the image . Therefore , out of practical considerations , the IOC has used a different poster , with the German text Olympische Spiele , and an athlete partly covered in the Dutch national flag , holding a peace leaf in his hand . This poster was made for a German book about the Amsterdam Olympics .

Selkirkshire or the County of Selkirk is a registration county of Scotland . It borders Peeblesshire to the west , Midlothian to the north , Berwickshire to the north-east , Roxburghshire to the east , and Dumfriesshire to the south . It derives its name from its county town , the Royal burgh of Selkirk . Until 1975 it was an one of the thirty three administrative counties of Scotland , with a county council formed by the Local Government ( Scotland ) Act 1889 . Under the Local Government ( Scotland ) Act 1973 the use of counties as local government areas was abolished across Scotland , with its area becoming part of the Ettrick and Lauderdale district of the Borders Region . Unlike many counties , Selkirkshire has not continued to exist as a lieutenancy areas , but has become part of Roxburgh , Ettrick and Lauderdale for these purposes . In the 1st Century AD Selkirk formed part of the lands of the Gadeni who hunted it rather than settled there . Neither the Romans , Angles , or the Saxons cleared much of the forestry there and for centuries Selkirk was known for its forest coverage . Indeed an alternative name for the county was Ettrick Forest . Under the Scottish kings the forest was regarded as Royal . Despite this it was not until the reign of James V that sheriffs were appointed to administer the county on the Crown 's behalf . Under Edward I of England , the forest was granted to the Earl of Gloucester . Later , the Earl of Pembroke assumed the hereditary sheriffdom . Under and after King Robert the Bruce , the Earls of Douglas , and later Earls of Angus administered the county on behalf of the Crown , until the Union of the Crowns . Folk ballads written of the county commemorate the Battle of Philiphaugh in 1645 , the ` Dowie Dens ' at Yarrow and Tibbie Shiels at St Mary 's Loch .
However since modern humans are on average approximately 6 cm ( 2 inches ) taller than Ancient Greeks ( and the same relative dimensions can be presumed for oarsmen and other athletes ) , the construction of a craft which followed the precise dimensions of the ancient vessel led to cramped rowing conditions and consequent restrictions on the modern crew 's ability to propel the vessel with full efficiency , which perhaps explains why the ancient speed records stand unbroken . The Fabrosauridae was originally proposed by Galton ( 1972 ) , as a group of basal ornithischian dinosaurs from the Early to Middle Jurassic . However , recent studies indicate the Fabrosaurs are not a natural grouping of dinosaurs , and instead consist of unrelated genera . The proposed `` Fabrosaurs '' descended from a Lesothosaurus-like animal . Proposed fabrosaurids were 1 â `` 2 meters long , and were lightly built and bipedal . Their skulls were triangular and had very large eye sockets . They were herbivorous and would have used agility to escape predators . Fabrosaurids are known from southern Africa in the Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic , as well as in China from the Middle and Upper Jurassic periods . Fabrosaurids bear a semblance to many other members of Ornithischia , and have attracted much interest in phylogenetic studies . However , most genera that were previously referred to as Fabrosauridae are only known from fragmented and partial remains , with most based on no more than isolated teeth , and their place in Fabrosauridae is questionable . For example , in 1990 , specimens of Agilisaurus found in the Middle Jurassic of Zigong , Sichuan , China , provided further evidence that led to paleontologists resolving systematic problems of the group Fabrosauridae . Galton ( 1972 ) , originally proposed the creation of Fabrosauridae based on the finding of cheek teeth . The recent discovery of a Middle Jurassic primitive ornithischian , Agilisaurus louderbacki , found in the Xiashaximiao Formation of Zigong , Sichuan Basin , China , has led to paleontologists learning more about the phylogeny of fabrosaurids . Fabrosaurids have many characters that are unique to their physiology , particularly unique tooth morphology and structure , and short forelimb lengths compared to hindlimbs . Unlike many other primitive Ornithischians , such as heterodontosaurids and hypsilophodontids , the teeth of fabrosaurids are very thinly and uniformly enameled . Compared to Agilisaurus , Fabrosaurus is much more primitive in that it has six premaxillary teeth , and a stout prepubis . Agilisaurus differs from Fabrosaurus in that it appears to be larger and more well developed in structure . The Upper Jurassic ornithischian dinosaur , Gongubusaurus , from China , is thought to be more closely related to fabrosaurids than hypsilophodontids . The type species , G. shiyii , is from the Shangshaximiao Formation in the Rongxian County in Sichuan Basin , has been classified from only a few scattered teeth . Fabrosaurids were relatively small ornithischian dinosaurs , averaging about 1 â `` 2 meters in body length , with a triangular skull that had large circular orbits on the sides . This suggests that fabrosaurids had relatively huge eyes that faced laterally . The forelimbs of fabrosaurids are considerably shorter than their hindlimbs . A small forelimb such as those present in Fabrosauridae would not have been useful for locomotion , and it is evident that fabrosaurids were bipedal dinosaurs . The entire skeleton was lightly built , with a largely fenestrated skull and a very stout neck and trunk . The tail is nearly half of the dinosaurs ' overall length . The long tail presumably acted as a counterbalance and as a compensating mechanism for shifts in the creature 's center of gravity .
The Memory of Earth ( 1992 ) is the first book of the Homecoming Saga by Orson Scott Card . The award-winning Homecoming saga is a loose sci-fi fictionalization of the first few hundred years recorded in the Book of Mormon . Humanity has lived for 40 million years on a planet called Harmony , after leaving an Earth that has been destroyed by human conflict . In order not to repeat the mistakes that led to the destruction of civilization on Earth , a computer , known as the Oversoul , was left as guardian of this planet . Its main mission was to prevent humans from developing technologies that could make wars a global affair . For that , humans were genetically modified so they could communicate with the Oversoul . The Oversoul uses this connection to make humans quite easily distracted when thinking about forbidden technologies , leading them to forget that train of thought . However , after this long time the Oversoul is beginning to fail , and it chooses a group of humans to return to Earth in search of the Keeper of Earth , in the hopes it will be able to find a way to maintain power over the people on Harmony . To this end the Oversoul recruits Volemak , father of the protagonist of the story , Nafai . Nafai and Issib , his brother , begin to try and defy the Oversoul 's capability to override thought . Through this they learn of the danger that it is in . Nafai begins hearing the Oversoul 's voice in his mind . The first book focuses on the family 's eventual betrayal , the taking of the Index , and the downfall of the man Gaballufix , who had been planning to ally the city of Basilica , the home of the main characters and the setting of the first half of the book , with a malignant nation . Nafai , Elemak and Mebbekew , his older half brothers , Issib and his father Volemak are eventually forced to leave the city . They come back to retrieve the Index of the Oversoul , which allows them to communicate with it directly . Because of Nafai 's careless blunders and miraculous successes , Elemak , Nafai 's oldest brother , begins to hate him , a theme that will play out throughout the rest of the saga . The characters listed here are those whose primary role is in The Memory of Earth . For other characters , see Homecoming Saga or individual books . ; Nafai : Youngest son of Wetchik Volemak and Rasa by second contract , brother to Elemak , Mebbekew , and Issib . Nafai is a tall , 18 year-old-boy ( 14 in `` temple years '' ) who clearly hears the voice of the Oversoul in his mind . Nafai and his brothers and father are banished from Basilica and are forced into the desert from a cunning plot conceived by Gaballufix . Volemak urges his four sons to go back to Basilica and retrieve the Index ( a tool or index used to retrieve information from the Oversoul ) . Later Nafai confronts Gaballufix and cuts off his head under the bidding of the Oversoul . ; Gaballufix : Elemak 's oldest ( half ) brother , son of Hosni by Zdedhnoi , and father of Sevet and Kokor by Rasa . He attempts to ally Basilica with Potokgavan against the Gorayni ( also known as the Wetheads ) . More importantly , he tries to draw the city into a war that goes beyond the Oversoul 's ( failing ) mental blocks , and destroy its traditional female-dominated structure with the help of holographically-disguised soldiers that roam the streets . He sets up a plot to kill Volemak , who opposes him ; after Volemak and his sons retreat to the desert , they realize that they need the Index , which is in Gaballufix 's possession . He is eventually killed by Nafai , who will agonize over this choice and never really forgive himself for it . ; Rashgallavik : Steward to the Wetchik fortune . After Volemak embarks on a series of seemingly ill-advised actions , Rashgallavik takes control of the money . Though his intentions ( to protect the Wetchik 's funds , as per his job ) are originally good , he is overwhelmed by his own power after first becoming the Wetchik himself and then taking over Gaballufix 's position . His tenuous hold over Gaballufix 's guards is broken by Hushidh . ; Hosni : Volemak 's `` auntie '' ( a woman assigned to a boy as he hits puberty , to teach him about sex through example ) and , by him , the mother of Elemak . She is also the mother of Gaballufix by Zdedhnoi , who is never mentioned within the series itself , only referenced in genealogy charts . Other children of Hosni 's by several different ( anonymous ) men , whose appearance is also limited to genealogy charts , are Psugal , Azh , and Okhai . ; Roptat : One of the three most influential men in Basilica , along with Volemak and Gaballufix . Gaballufix plots to have Roptat and Volemak killed , and frame Elemak for the crime . ; Elemak : The eldest child of Volemak the Wetchik by Hosni . Half brother to Gaballufix .
The Haiti national football team represents Haiti in association football and is controlled by the FÃ dÃ ration HaÃ tienne de Football , the governing body for football in Haiti . Haiti 's home ground is Stade Sylvio Cator in Port-au-Prince and their head coach is Edson Tavares . They have made one appearance at the FIFA World Cup , in 1974 , but were beaten convincingly in the opening qualifying stages by three of the pre-tournament favorites ; Italy , Poland , and Argentina . Their most recent achievement was in 2007 , when the national team won the 2007 Caribbean Nations Cup . Haiti has one of the longest football traditions in the Caribbean and was an early participant in World Cup qualifying . Throughout the 60s , and 70s , Haiti 's footballing status in the region remained very strong , being considered the third strongest team in CONCACAF after Mexico and arguably Costa Rica . The Duvalier regime during the 70s ensured Haiti 's qualification in regional and world competition through heavy political support as a method of improving the island 's standing in sports . The strength of the national selection ultimately culminated in Haiti 's first ever World Cup appearance in 1974 , in which they surprised the world in their opening goal against a considerably stronger Italian team . The island nation has produced many talented star players over the years . The period from the mid-1960s to early 1980s could be considered a golden age for Haitian football . With Antoine Tessy as coach for much of this period , Haiti would emerge as one of the strongest teams in the CONCACAF zone , being pooled with other regionally strong football nations such as Mexico and arguably Costa Rica . By 1965 , players like Henri Francillon , Philippe Vorbe and Guy St-Vil were already playing in the team and would be stalwarts of the side in the coming years . The team developed sufficiently to reach the final round of qualifying for 1970 , where they faced El Salvador . After losing the first leg at home , Haiti pulled off a 3-0 win away but the rules of the day dictated a play-off on neutral ground which El Salvador won to secure a place in the 1970 FIFA World Cup . In the 1974 qualifiers , Haiti once again reached the final round in a qualifying tournament completely played at home . Haitian military rule of the time would make sure Haiti qualified at all costs . This time , with all odds on their favor , they would top the group and qualify for the 1974 World Cup . In West Germany , they would be drawn in an extremely tough group with Italy , Argentina and Poland . However , they surprised the football world in their debut game when star forward Emmanuel Sanon scored to give Haiti a lead over Italy , at the same time ending Dino Zoff 's still standing record run of 1142 minutes without conceding a goal in international matches . They eventually lost 1-3 , and would lose to Poland ( 0-7 ) and Argentina ( 1-4 ) , but their brave display against Italy is forgotten by few . Haiti would reach the final rounds of 1978 and 1982 qualifiers , but failed to make the cut . The years since have seen Haiti 's footballing status decline markedly . In recent years , the political situation in the country has led to numerous defections from members of the soccer team . The team has rebuilt somewhat through the Haitian diaspora in Miami , Florida , and some Haitian home games have been played in Miami in recent years . Last time Haiti played in Miami was on August 28 , 2007 against Club AtlÃ tico Boca Juniors . Haiti as of recently has been rising once again as a footballing power in CONCACAF . In the 2010 Haiti earthquake at least 30 people with ties to Haitian football perished , including players , coaches , referees and administrative and medical representatives . Twenty others with ties to Haitian football were feared buried in the ruins . The following squad was called up for the friendly against El Salvador . ( Caps and goals as of February 3 , 2011 . )
The tehsil is administratively subdivided into seven Union Councils and is heaquartered at the city of Uthal . Mansehra Tehsil is a subdivision ( tehsil ) of Mansehra District in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan . `` TahsÄ `` l of HazÄ ra District , Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa , lying between 34 Â 14 ' and 35 Â 10 ' N. and 72 Â 55 '' and 74 Â 6 ' E. , with an area of 1486 s.

Zayin ( also spelled Zain or Zayn or simply Zay ) is the seventh letter of many Semitic abjads , including Phoenician ð , Aramaic , Hebrew , Syriac Ü and Perso-Arabic alphabet ( see below ) . It represents the sound . The Phoenician letter gave rise to the Greek Zeta ( Î -- ) , Etruscan z , Latin Z , and Cyrillic Ze Ð -- . The Phoenician letter appears to be named after a sword or other weapon . ( In Hebrew , `` Zayin '' means sword , and the verb `` Lezayen '' means to arm ) . The Proto-Sinaitic glyph according to Brian Colless may have been called ziqq , based on a hieroglyph depicting a `` manacle '' . In modern hebrew the frequency of the usage of zayin , out of all the letters , is 0.88 % . In modern Hebrew , the combination -- ( zayin followed by a geresh ) is used in loanwords and foreign names to denote as in vision . In gematria , Zayin represents the number seven , and when used at the beginning of Hebrew years , it means 7000 ( i.e. -- `` in numbers would be the date 7754 ) . Zayin is also one of the seven letters which receive a special crown ( called a tagin ) when written in a Sefer Torah . It is one of several Hebrew letters that have an additional meaning as a noun . The others are : Bet ( the second letter ) whose name is a grammatical form of the word for `` house '' ; Vav ( the sixth letter ) whose name means `` hook '' ; Kaf ( the eleventh letter ) whose name means `` palm ( of the hand ) '' ; Ayin ( the sixteenth letter ) whose name means `` eye '' ; Pe ( the seventeenth letter ) whose name means `` mouth '' ; Qof ( the nineteenth letter ) whose name means `` monkey '' ; Shin ( the twenty-first letter ) whose name means `` tooth '' ; Tav ( the twenty-second letter ) whose name means `` mark '' ; and several other Hebrew letters whose namest are ancient Hebrew forms of nouns still used , with a slight change of form or pronunciation , as nouns in modern Hebrew . ) Zain is a constant with the `` z '' sound which is a voiced alveolar fricative . The letter is named , ( DIN 31635 : ) variously , zayn , zÄ i , and zaâ . It is commonly known in Egypt as . It is written in several ways depending on its position in the word : The similarity to is likely a function of the original Syriac forms converging to a single symbol , requiring that one of them be distinguished as a dot ; a similar process occurred to ( ( Gimel ( letter ) ) ) and ( ( Heth ( letter ) ) ) . The same letter is used in a number of languages with another name : Ze . It also has a modified version : \/ Ê ' e \/ which are used in Persian , Pashto , Kurdish , Urdu and Uyghur ( see ( ( KÌ ona YezikÌ KÌ ona YezikÌ ) ) ) .
In mathematics ( more specifically geometry ) , a semicircle is a two-dimensional geometric shape that forms half of a circle . Being half of a circle 's 360 Â , the arc of a semicircle always measures 180 Â or a half turn . A triangle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right triangle . A semicircle can be used to construct arithmetic and geometric means of two lengths using straight-edge and compass . If we make a semicircle with a diameter of a + b , then the length its radius is the arithmetic mean ( since it 's half of the diameter ) . The geometric mean can be found by dividing the diameter into two segments of lengths a and b , and then connecting their common end and the semicircle with a segment perpendicular to the diameter . The length of the resulting segment is the geometric mean , which can be proved using the Pythagorean theorem . This method can be used to accomplish quadrature of a rectangle ( since a square whose sides are equal to geometric mean of sides of a rectangle has the same area as the rectangle ) , and thus any figure for which we can construct a rectangle with equal area , such as any polygon ( but not a circle ) .

Tiscali s.p.a. is an Italian telecommunications company , based in Cagliari , Sardinia , that provides internet and telecommunications services to its domestic market . It previously had operations in other European nations through its acquisition of many smaller European Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) in the late 1990s , but in subsequent years these have been divested . Tiscali was formed in 1998 by Renato Soru when the Italian telecommunications market was deregulated . Its name is formed from a 2000 year old nuragic village situated in Sardinia . The company 's original priority was internet access . During the dot-com boom Italian stock exchange asked Renato Soru to make an IPO and join the stock exchange . On October 1999 Tiscali entered the Italian Stock Exchange , 1 stock was sold for 46 Euro . The company acquired , in quick succession , World Online ( The Netherlands ) , Liberty Surf ( France ) and LineOne ( UK ) , instantly giving it market presence in those countries . This made it the third largest Internet Service Provider in Europe , with presence in most European countries . Its founder , Renato Soru , ran for elections as governor of Sardinia in 2004 and subsequently left Tiscali after appointing a new CEO , Ruud Huisman . Ruud Huisman was chosen by Soru as CEO of Tiscali . Huisman sold some assets , but after a year he left the company following disagreements with the board . Tommaso Pompei followed as head , deciding in November 2007 on a new industrial plan 2008-2012 , but on February 2008 he resigned as CEO . Mario Rosso was chosen as CEO of Tiscali to restructure the company 's debt and he was ceo for 1 year . In February 2009 , Soru lost elections for a second term and he decided to come back to Tiscali as CEO . In March 2009 , Tiscali asked banks to postpone the payment of interest of debts following a failure to sell Tiscali UK to BSkyB . In June 2009 the UK branch was sold to The Carphone Warehouse and merged into its TalkTalk operations . In September 2009 , to avoid bankruptcy , the board decided to reverse the 10:1 stock split and increase capital by 180 million Euro . As of 2009 , Tiscali operates only in its home market .

The Template : Strlen_quick gives the length of parameter 1 , as a string , with a count of 0-70 characters , using a simple , quick method . The template was designed to run quickly and use only 5 levels of expansion depth , rather than 9-13 or more levels as in other string-length templates . The optional parameter `` extra = -1 '' can be used to return a specific value when a string exceeds the 70-character limit . The default result is -1 to indicate a string longer than 70 characters .
Cocu was a versatile player , being able to play in defense or midfield , in more than one position , but usually played a central playmaker role or defensive midfield , dictating his team 's play . He was best known for his tackling , vision , and great teamwork . Cocu first started out playing football at amateur level with clubs such as AFC '34 and DCS Zevenaar . He signed his first professional contract with AZ in the 1988-89 season when he was just 17 years old . After an encouraging start at the club , he joined Vitesse in 1990 . His career at Vitesse was blighted by him breaking his right leg in his first game against Sparta Rotterdam . After fully recovering in 1992 , he assisted his club to a top five finish in the Eredivisie and a qualification spot for the UEFA Cup competition . AFC Ajax tried to sign him twice when he was at Vitesse , but it was Dick Advocaat who signed him for PSV in 1995 . During his tenure at PSV , Cocu won one Eredivisie league title . With international team colleagues such as Jaap Stam , Arthur Numan , Boudewijn Zenden , and Wim Jonk all forming the core of the squad , he was also a teammate of Ronaldo and Luc Nilis . Having played some of his finest football at PSV , Cocu moved to La Liga giants FC Barcelona after the 1998 FIFA World Cup . Louis van Gaal , who coached BarÃ a at that time , also signed many Dutch World Cup players such as Frank de Boer , Ronald de Boer , Patrick Kluivert , Boudewijn Zenden , Ruud Hesp , Michael Reiziger , Winston Bogarde , as well as Marc Overmars in 2000 and the Spanish team , who was soon nicknamed `` Oranje Barcelona '' or `` Ajax Barcelona '' , were crowned league champions in 1997-1998 and 1998-1999 . In the following seasons , while most of the Dutch contingent at Barcelona , like the de Boer brothers and Zenden , were transferred , Cocu managed to stay with the club . At the start of the 2003-04 season , Kluivert , Reiziger , Overmars , Giovanni van Bronckhorst , and Cocu were the remaining Dutch players ( Edgar Davids would join halfway during the season on loan from Juventus ) . The man in charge was another Dutchman , Frank Rijkaard . In February 2005 , Cocu was honored by FC Barcelona and the Camp Nou faithful with a hearty ovation before the start of a match , and president Joan Laporta presented the player with a plaque to commemorate his career , highlighting his dedication and loyalty to the club . Cocu holds the record of appearances for BarÃ a as a foreign player , with 292 overall appearances . Although he was proposed a new contract , Cocu left Barcelona before the start of UEFA Euro 2004 for his old club PSV . With PSV , Cocu led the team to three championships in just three years . In what would become his final match for PSV , on 29 April 2007 , Cocu sealed PSV 's Eredivisie win by scoring the fifth goal against Vitesse , thereby finishing above Ajax , who at that point were virtual champions on goal difference . Cocu was also part of the successful ` golden triangle ' on midfield . Together with Mark van Bommel and Swiss midfielder Johann Vogel he reached the semi-finals of the 2004-05 UEFA Champions League . Cocu left PSV at the end of the season and signed on 15 August 2007 for Al-Jazira Club in the United Arab Emirates for one year . It was at PSV that Cocu got first called-up to the Dutch national squad , and he was handed his debut in a friendly on 24 April 1996 against Germany . He was then selected in the final squad for UEFA Euro 1996 . By 1998 , Cocu was a permanent fixture in the national side and was selected by Guus Hiddink for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France , where he scored two goals in the group stage . Cocu was used in a variety of different positions in that tournament . An example would be in the semi-final against Brazil where he filled in at left-back , as incumbent Numan was suspended and substitute Bogarde suffered a serious knee-injury during a training session prior to the match . The game would not end well for Cocu , however , as he missed one of the penalties in the shootout which saw the Dutch exit the tournament . Cocu represented his country in UEFA Euro 2000 on home ground and also played in UEFA Euro 2004 in Portugal . In the latter , Cocu was captain of the Dutch side , but after the tournament , new coach Marco van Basten handed the captain 's armband over to Edgar Davids and later to goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar . With Cocu in a pivotal role in midfield , in 2004-05 , the Netherlands won 10 out of their 12 qualifying games en route to qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany . Cocu retired from the national team after that tournament , having appeared in all four of the Netherlands ' games . In April 2008 , Cocu was offered a role as assistant coach of the Dutch national team . He also started to coach the youth teams of PSV at the start of the 2008-09 season , but was promoted to assistant manager of the senior squad after Huub Stevens left . On the 1st July a newspaper report linked him to the current vacant position of the Australian National Team .

Catchers often experience knee tendinitis because of the constant squatting and bending of the knees while caching . Satin is a weave that typically has a glossy surface and a dull back . It is a warp-dominated weaving technique that forms a minimum number of interlacings in a fabric . If a fabric is formed with a satin weave using filament fibers such as silk , nylon , or polyester , the corresponding fabric is termed a satin , although some definitions insist that the fabric be made from silk . If the yarns used are short-staple yarns such as cotton , the fabric formed is considered a sateen . A satin-woven fabric tends to have a high luster due to the high number of floats on the fabric . Floats are missed interlacings , where the warp yarn lies on top of the weft yarn , or vice versa . The floats tend to make the fabric look glossier as well as give it a smoother surface . Many variations can be made of the basic satin weave including a granite weave and a check weave . Satin weaves , twill weaves , and plain weaves are the three basic types of weaving by which the majority of woven products are formed . Satin is commonly used in apparel : satin baseball jackets , athletic shorts , women 's lingerie , nightgowns , blouses and evening gowns , but also in some men 's boxer shorts , shirts and neckties . It is also used in the production of pointe shoes for use in ballet . Other uses include interior furnishing fabrics , upholstery , and bed sheets . Originally , during the middle ages , satin was made of silk ; consequently it was very expensive , used only by the upper classes . The name derives its origin from the Chinese port city of Quanzhou , whose name form in ( Mediaeval ) Arabic was Zayton .

Richard Sevigny ( born April 11 , 1957 in Montreal , Quebec ) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Montreal Canadiens and Quebec Nordiques in the National Hockey League . Before making the NHL , Sevigny played for 5 different teams . He spent his junior career in the QMJHL with the Granby Vicks and the Sherbrooke Castors . In 1976 , Sevigny was selected to the QMJHL West First All-Star Team by playing in 55 games and posting a 3.85 GAA . His strong play made Team Canada notice him and he was selected to play in the 1976 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships where he won a silver medal . Sevigny 's play at the international level caught the attention of the Montreal Canadiens and in 1977 , he was selected 124th overall in the 1977 NHL Amateur Draft . The Canadiens also picked seven other goalies creating some competition to join the roster . In 1978 , Sevigny played for the Kalamazoo Wings in the IHL . He played in 35 games and recorded a 3.01 GAA , good enough to be selected to the Second All-Star Team . He then spent the next season in the AHL , with the Springfield Indians , and the Nova Scotia Voyageurs . In the 1979 Stanley Cup Finals , Michel Larocque was scheduled to start game two . Laroque was injured during the pre-game warm up and Sevigny was dressed as a backup in his place . The Canadiens would win that year and Sevigny 's name was engraved on the Stanley Cup before ever playing an NHL game . With Ken Dryden , retiring in the off-season in 1979 , spots opened up on the Canadiens roster . Sevigny attended training camp and played well enough to start in eleven regular season games in the 1979-80 season . The following season , he played in 33 games , won 20 of them and had a league best 2.40 GAA . He won the Vezina Trophy along with Denis Herron and Michel Larocque with Montreal that season . On April 20 , 1984 , Sevigny took part in the `` Vendredi Saint '' brawl against the Quebec Nordiques . The two benches cleared twice during the game and delayed the game for more than an hour . The next two seasons saw Sevigny post back to back winning records but he was not offered a contract by the Canadiens . They released him and he was quickly picked up by the Quebec Nordiques . He signed a four-year deal and spent the next three seasons with the Nordiques and their AHL affiliate , the Fredericton Express before finishing his career in France in 1990 . According to hockey lore , Sevigny was quoted as saying that Guy Lafleur would have Wayne Gretzky in his back pocket during the 1981 playoffs , a quote that motivated the Oilers team to victory over the fabled Habs . Sevigny has involved himself in old-timers charity hockey games and has coached the semi-pro Verdun Dragons .
A living room , also known as sitting room , lounge room or lounge ( in the United Kingdom and Australia ) , is a room for entertaining adult guests , reading , or other activities . The term front room can also be used to describe a living room , because in many homes the living room is at the very front . In modern homes and apartments , the living room has replaced the old-fashioned front parlor . In the 19th century , the front parlor was the room in the house used for formal social events , including where the recently deceased were laid out before their funeral . The term marks the twentieth-century effort of architects and builders to strip the parlor of its burial and mourning associations . This room was relabeled with the more affirmative term `` living room '' in the 20th century . A typical Western living room will be furnished with a sofa , chairs , occasional tables , and bookshelves , lamps , rugs , as well as other pieces of furniture . Traditionally , a sitting room in the United Kingdom would have a fireplace . In Japan , people traditionally sat on tatami instead of chairs , but Western-style decor is also common to have in Japanese homes nowadays . In the United States and Canada , sometimes the living room is reserved for more formal and quiet entertaining while a separate recreation room or family room is used for more casual activities , watching television , spending time with children , and drinking . In recent years , the term `` great room '' has come to be used to denote the family room , especially if it is open to the kitchen , and may feature a vaulted ceiling .
A head coach , senior coach or manager is a professional at training and developing athletes . They typically hold a more public profile and are paid more than other coaches . In some sports such as soccer and baseball , the head coach is usually called a manager , whilst in other sports such as Australian rules football they are generally termed a senior coach . Other coaches are usually subordinate to the head coach , often in offensive positions or defensive positions , and occasionally proceeding down into individualized position coaches . Head coaches in American football have different responsibilities depending on what level of the sport they are coaching . In high school football , head coaches are often teachers who coach . Often they are compensated by a small increase in pay , but the time and effort given up for the job requires that the coach be eager to invest a lot of their time into the project and be passionate about the sport . Because high school coaching positions are often hard to fill , the head coach has a much more complete hold on the intricacies of the team . He may have to perform the duties of a defensive or offensive coordinator . Often , high school head coaches have to do more work off the field than on . It is important that head coaches in high school hire a competent and proactive coaching staff because when the head coach is pulled away from practice then he must be confident that his team is in good hands with his other coaches and staff . One of the most difficult issues , off the field , that head coaches must deal with is the parents . He must be able to handle any issues that parents may have with the way that the head coach is running the program , all along while staying professional and not being demeaning . One of the major features of head coaching in college football is the high turnover rate for jobs . With few exceptions ( notable ones including Joe Paterno , Frank Beamer , Bobby Bowden and LaVell Edwards ) college coaches often routinely change jobs , rarely staying at a school for more than a decade . They have a very well-paid staff and as such are more free to concentrate on the overall aspect of the team rather than dealing with the nuances of training regimens and such . Unlike head coaches at other levels , college coaching staffs are solely responsible for the composition and development of players on the team . The ability to recruit and develop top players plays a major role in success at this level . A college coach acts as the face of a team , at an age when many young players do not wish to be hounded by media . They are often called upon to discuss off-the-field incidents such as rule infractions or player antics . Sometimes , the coach becomes a celebrity in his own right , e.g. , Lou Holtz . At the professional level , coaches may work for millions of dollars a year . They are less in the media than their college counterparts as their players are often more than willing to talk to the media , and more than outrageous enough to attract the attention . The head coach at the pro level thus has much more time to devote to tactics and playbooks , which are combed over by staff paid even more than at the college level . Head coaching , due to the extensive time on the road and long hours , is a very stressful job . Since the money is good at high levels , many coaches retire in their early fifties .

The anticipated 1940 Summer Olympics , officially known as the Games of the XII Olympiad and originally scheduled to be held from September 21 to October 6 , 1940 , in Tokyo , Japan , were canceled due to the outbreak of World War II . Tokyo was stripped of its host status for the Games by the IOC after the renunciation by the Japanese of the IOC 's Cairo Conference of 1938 , due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War . The government of Japan had abandoned its support for the 1940 Games in July 1938 . The IOC then awarded the Games to Helsinki , Finland , the runner-up in the original bidding process . The Games were then scheduled to be staged from July 20 to August 4 , 1940 . The Olympic Games were suspended indefinitely following the outbreak of World War II and did not resume until the London Games of 1948 . With the Olympics canceled , the major international athletics event of the year turned out to be the annual Finland-Sweden athletics international , held at the new Helsinki Olympic Stadium , exceptionally held as a triple international among Finland , Sweden and Germany . Gliding was due to be an Olympic sport in the 1940 Games after a demonstration at the Berlin Games in 1936 . The sport has not been featured in any Games since , though the glider designed for it , the DFS Olympia Meise was produced in large numbers after the war . Helsinki eventually held the 1952 Summer Olympics and Tokyo the 1964 Summer Olympics . Despite the cancellation of the 1940 Olympics , the Tokyo organizing committee released its budget for the Games . In a departure from standard practice , the budget included all capital outlays as well as direct organizing costs . The total budget was Â 20.1 million , one-third of which would have been paid by the Tokyo metropolitan government . During August 1940 , prisoners of war celebrated a `` special Olympics '' called International Prisoner-of-War Olympic Games . These were inaugurated and celebrated in stalag number XIII-A in Langwasser close to Nuremberg , Germany . An Olympic flag 29 by 46 cm in size was made of a Polish prisonerâ s shirt and , drawn in crayon , it featured the Olympic rings and banners for Belgium , France , Great Britain , Norway , Poland , Russia and Yugoslavia . A feature film was produced by the director Andrzej Kotkowski in 1979 called Olimpiada '40 telling the story of these games and one of the prisoners of war , Teodor Niewiadomski .
The 1944 Appalachians tornado outbreak was a deadly tornado outbreak that hit the Midwest and Middle Atlantic regions of the United States on June 22 â `` 23 , 1944 . Particularly hard hit was the town of Shinnston , West Virginia in Harrison County which was completely destroyed by a violent tornado before 9:00 PM EDT on June 23 . It was and still remains the worst tornado outbreak ever to hit the state of West Virginia . At least 154 people were killed and hundreds others injured in the eastern U.S. , while at least 9 were killed across the Midwest . After producing several tornadoes across the Midwest and Ohio Valley region on June 22 and killing at least nine people near the Wisconsin-Illinois border , the storm produced a particularly deadly tornado ( or several tornadoes ) across the Appalachian region of West Virginia , Maryland and Pennsylvania on June 23 . The storms killed at least 100 in West Virginia alone ( 72 in Harrison County ) , 50 others in Pennsylvania and Maryland , and injured at least 800 across the three states . In addition of Shinnston , the West Virginia communities of Flemington , Meadowsville , Montrose and Thomas were also hit . In addition to Harrison County , West Virginia 's Marion ( 3 deaths ) , Barbour ( 9 deaths ) , Taylor ( 9 deaths ) and Randolph Counties ( 7 deaths ) were also hit . Eleven people were killed in Chartiers , Pennsylvania by another tornado which killed in total 30 , and 17 were killed by the McKeesport , Pennsylvania tornado near Pittsburgh . All three tornadoes were rated F4 on the Fujita scale . At least 400 structures were destroyed and another 800 damaged . While it is unclear if one single tornado produced all fatalities in the Appalachian region , the Shinnston tornado is ranked at least as the 14th deadliest tornado of all time in the United States .
Acanthomyops murphii is a species of ant in the family Formicidae . It is endemic to the United States .
Pediococcus is a genus of Gram-positive lactic acid bacteria , placed within the family of Lactobacillaceae . They usually occur in pairs or tetrads , and divide along two planes of symmetry , as do the other lactic acid cocci genera Aerococci and Tetragenococcus . They are purely homofermentative . Pediococcus dextrinicus has recently been reassigned to the genus Lactobacillus . Pediococcus is , along with other lactic acid bacteria such as Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus responsible for the fermentation of cabbage , making it Sauerkraut . In this process the sugars in fresh cabbage are transformed to lactic acids which give it a sour flavor and good keeping qualities . Pediococcus bacteria are usually considered contaminants of beer and wine although their presence is sometimes desired in beer styles such as Lambic . Certain Pediococcus isolates produce diacetyl which gives a buttery or butterscotch aroma to some wines ( such as Chardonnay ) and a few styles of beer . Pediococcus species are often used in silage inoculants . Pediococci are used as probiotics , and are commonly added as beneficial microbes in the creation of cheeses and yogurts .

It was formed from the fusion of 5 communes : Couture-Saint-Germain , Lasne-Chapelle-Saint-Lambert , Maransart , Ohain and Plancenoit . While the commune has taken the name of Lasne , the administrative offices are in the village of Ohain . Ohain contains a fine example of a Brabant-Wallon village green : almost triangular in shape and sloping gently . The green contains many mature trees and is bordered on 2 sides by old houses and shops . The church in Ohain was built around the year 1200 and the strongly built square tower dates from this time . The village of Couture St Germain contains the ruins of the Cistercian Abbey of Aywiers which has been the subject of pilgrimages since the late 19th century in honor of Saint Lutgarde who lived there for 30 years at the end of the 12th century . Much of the Battle of Waterloo was fought in the village of Plancenoit , notably around the church and the fortified farm of La Papelotte . The cemetery wall is said to still contain holes made by musket balls . It was in Plancenoit that BlÃ 1\/4 cher 's troops engaged Napoleon 's army , having marched from Wavre . BlÃ 1\/4 cher and Wellington met after the battle at the farm ` La Belle Alliance ' - now a bar . The current historic area commemorating the battle is jointly administered by the communes of Lasne , Waterloo and Braine-l ` Alleud . Lasne is in a region of Belgium known as the Pays Romain or Roman Land . The Grand Chemin is a major road traversing the commune , linking the large towns of Wavre and Nivelles , and formed a part of a network of Roman roads ultimately linking the ports of the Rhine and Seine with sea ports . The distance between small chapels on this path is equal to one or more leagues , or at a precise fraction of a Gaulish league , where a Gaulish league equals 2222 metres . In 2007 , Lasne was still considered as the richest commune of Belgium , with an average taxable income of 40,949 euros per year according to the latest report of the INS ( Institut National de Statistique ) .

Primarily a deep-lying playmaker in midfield , he was also competent as an attacking midfielder or playing in the holding role . Continually recognized for his ability he was highly rated in the football industry . In 2000 , former Romanian legend Gheorghe Hagi rated him as one of the finest ball-playing midfielders in Europe , and in 2006 , Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had suggested that if he were ten years younger , Tugay 's ability would make him an ideal player for the Old Trafford team . When Tugay 's manager at the time , Mark Hughes , was asked if he too wished Tugay was ten years younger , his answer was `` No , because if he was , he 'd be playing in a Barcelona shirt . '' He was the coordinator of the Galatasaray youth academy , after a short spell working with Mark Hughes at Manchester City . He played for Galatasaray from 1987 to 2000 , where he won the Turkish League six times and the Turkey Cup four times . The midfielder was made captain at Galatasaray in the 1992 â `` 93 season , making him the youngest captain in the history of his club . He had signed for Scottish club Rangers in the January 2000 mid season transfer window , and joined Blackburn Rovers for the 2001 â `` 02 season . Former boss Graeme Souness brought Tugay to Ewood Park from Scottish side Rangers F.C. in the summer of 2001 for a Â # 1.3 m fee . His debut for Rovers was as a substitute against Sunderland . His first goal came on 14 October 2001 in a 7 â `` 1 home thrashing against West Ham United in which he scored with a trademark effort from outside the box , lobbing the keeper . Tugay immediately became a fans favorite at Blackburn , where he has been an integral part of the club 's success on the field since his first season . Unfortunately he missed Blackburn 's League Cup final win in 2002 through suspension . Tugay was named Blackburn 's Player of the Year in the 2003 â `` 04 campaign .

A range of passing from five yards to 50 , Tugay has been called a pass-master . He was capable of threatening goal with a sweetly-hit long-range drive . Tugay was also unafraid of tracking-back and getting stuck in when the game required a more physical approach . On 3 June 2009 Tugay began working with his former manager Mark Hughes behind the scenes at Manchester City F.C in a coaching role . He was linked for various assistant positions for the Turkish national team after Fatih Terim 's departure , however he became the coordinator for the Galatasaray youth academy in February 2010 .

On March 22 , 2011 Hagi was sacked following a string of poor results . Tugay refused to become the head coach until the end of the season , saying it would be wrong to accept the position for the head coach right after the sacking of Hagi . Tugay generally keeps himself out of the media spotlight , and even with very good English and an apparent good sense of humor , he rarely gives an interview , even to his previous club 's own radio station ( Radio Rovers ) . Tugay is married to Etkin , a former Galatasaray and Turkish international basketball player . He has two children , named Berke and Melissa . As a youngster , he was also an extremely promising motor racer , competing as high as a Formula 3 level .

Verviers is a Walloon city and municipality located in the Belgian province of LiÃ ge . The Verviers municipality includes the old communes of Ensival , Lambermont , Petit-Rechain , Stembert , and Heusy . It is also the center of an agglomeration that includes Dison and Pepinster making it the second biggest in the province and an important regional center , conveniently located roughly halfway between LiÃ ge and the German border . Verviers is Wallonia 's `` Water Capital '' . Various flint and bone fragments , as well as Roman coins , were found in this area , attesting to the early settlements in the region . In the 4th century , the Romans had to deal with a constant push of Germanic tribes coming from the east . Successful at first at containing them , they finally had to concede defeat , allowing Clovisâ s Salian Franks to occupy the region at the end of the 5th century . The Verviers area was covered with forests and became a hunting ground for the Merovingian kings , who maintained a vicus in neighbouring Theux . It was also slowly Christianized by the monks of the nearby Abbey of Stavelot . In the 10th century , Charles the Simple ceded the Marquisate of Franchimont to the bishop of LiÃ ge , just before the creation of the Prince-Bishopric . LiÃ ge took direct control of the marquisate in 1014 , an act which was confirmed by emperor Frederick Barbarossa and by Pope Adrian IV in 1155 . The first mention of a textile industry in this area dates from the 15th century . One century later , the cloth industry took the place of the older metallurgical works , thanks in part to the Eighty Years War raging in the neighbouring Netherlands . The size of the town , however , remained relatively modest . It was only in 1651 that the expansion of the fulleries led to Verviers being recognized as one of the prince-bishopric â s bonnes villes ( main cities ) . The end of the 18th century was troubled by the French Revolution . The annexation of LiÃ ge to France in 1795 caused a steep economic decline and unprecedented misery . The cityâ s fortunes rose again after the Battle of Waterloo ( 1815 ) . Verviers was at the eastern end of the sillon industriel , the industrial backbone of Wallonia . Industrialist William Cockerill used British know-how to start a new era in Verviers ' textile industry . Roads were paved , gas lighting was installed , and the city doubled in size thanks to the Industrial Revolution . After World War I , Verviers could share with Bradford the title of â Wool Capital of the Worldâ . Verviers was home to a thriving wool and textile industry that was renowned for its quality . It contributed greatly to the wealth of the town . However , as of the 1950s , the local factories could not face international competition and started closing one after the other which prompted the economic decline of the town . The economy has been slowly recovering since the mid-1990s but remains fragile . Several commercial complexes have opened in recent years in an attempt to revitalize the most affected areas .

This period also saw him making his debut for the Romanian national team on August 20 , 2003 .

He established himself as a more important player for the team as well . His development in his career was set on hold due to a knee injury which sidelined him for a long time , resulting in only one appearance for Ajax in the 2005-06 season . Also in the following season Mitea did not play regularly as manager Henk ten Cate choose to overlook him and he was no longer first choice for the left-wing position . Despite the lack of appearances in these two seasons he did add two KNVB Cups to his list of trophies . Due to minor injuries and still being out of favor with Henk Ten Cate , and then temporary replacement coach Adrie Koster , Mitea did not play a single game for Ajax during the 2007-08 season . Unsurprisingly , Mitea was n't in new coach Marco Van Basten 's plans and was told to look for a new club . Mitea returned to Dinamo BucureÅ ti in August 2008 signing a 4 year contract , but after only 1 season , in the summer of 2009 he left Dinamo and became a free agent .
The Districts of Pakistan are the second order administrative divisions of Pakistan . Districts were the third order of administrative divisions , below provinces and `` divisions '' , until the reforms of August 2000 , when `` divisions '' were abolished . Districts now form the top tier of a three-tier system of local government with the two lower tiers composed of approximately 400 tehsils and more than six thousand union councils . Prior to 2001 , there were 106 districts but with the reorganisation , these were reduced to 102 by the merger of the five districts of Karachi Central , Karachi East , Karachi South , Karachi West and Malir to form Karachi District . The five districts had formed the division of Karachi which was abolished . The number of districts rose to 106 again in December 2004 , when four new districts were created in the province of Sindh of which one ( Umerkot ) had existed until 2000 and three districts ( Kashmore , Qambar and Jamshoro ) were newly created . In May 2005 , the Punjab provincial government created a new district by raising the status of Nankana Sahib from a tehsil of Sheikhpura District to a district in its own right . In Azad Kashmir , the second tier of government is formed by three administrative divisions with a third tier of ten districts . In Gilgit-Baltistan , there are six districts divided between the two regions of Gilgit and Baltistan ; Baltistan being a part of Ladakh under Pakistani control , the other part being under Indian control .

Pappo is the pseudonym of Argentine blues and metal\/rock musician Norberto Napolitano ( Buenos Aires , 10 March 1950 â `` LujÃ n , Buenos Aires Province , 24 February 2005 ) . A native of the middle-class La Paternal neighborhood in Buenos Aires , Pappo started playing the guitar at the age of ten , and became active in Argentine rock since its beginnings ; Pappo was a force in its transition from English to Spanish as guitarist of Los Gatos , the first rock band to enter the mainstream charts in Argentina . He also played in the first incarnation of cult band Los Abuelos de la Nada and in the quasi-psychedelic La Pesada del Rock and Roll . With his band , Pappo 's Blues , he recorded and toured extensively . He became an underground working-class hero , but received no radio airplay . In the mid-1970s , Pappo spent some time in Brazil and also in England , playing alongside Peter Green ( formerly of Fleetwood Mac ) , Lemmy ( who later achieved fame with MotÃ rhead ) , Hannibal Reitano ( member of `` Comandante EnergÃ a '' ) , and other rock and blues greats . By the time in which they recorded the third album ( Pappo 's Blues Volumen 3 ) , there had been two changes in the group : David LebÃ n ( bass ) left , and his place was taken by C.A Machi Rufino and Black Amaya , whose place was taken by Pomo . The recording of Pappo 's Blues Volumen 4 was marked by the return of David LebÃ n and Black Amaya and the incorporation of Alejandro Medina . On the same year the discographic company edited `` TriÃ ngulo '' and in 1975 Pappo 's Blues Volumen 6 with songs that had already been recorded , in which Pappo played with Eduardo Barbagnatti and Eduardo Beaudoux . In 1978 Pappo , this time with Alejandro Medina playing bass and DarÃ o Fernandez with the drums , recorded Pappo 's Blues Volumen 7 . On November 14 , 1980 the band officially dissolved , but `` Pappo 's band '' kept playing occasionally . The band recorded Hombre Suburbano in 1994 ; Caso Cerrado in 1995 and Auto Rojo in 1998 . Back in Argentina , Pappo formed Riff , a heavy metal band . During the 1982 Falklands war , Argentine music was given a large share of radio play , and Riff became popular with rockers . With the advent of popular blues bands in the 1980s , such as Memphis La Blusera , Pappo was recognized as the godfather of Argentine blues . As such , he enjoyed the appreciation of B. B. King who admitted cherishing many of Pappo 's records , and with whom he played at the Madison Square Garden in 1993 and 1994 . BB King said in one occasÃ on that he had traveled by 67 countries and Pappo was the only great blues player he found , and also that he was one of the best guitar players , not only in Argentina but in the whole world . Since 1984 , Pappo alternated solo work with re-unions of Pappo 's Blues and Riff . In the late 1980s Pappo spent time in the United States and formed a new version of Riff , which became Pappo y Widowmakers ( Pappo and the Widowmakers ) in 1989 . This version of the band was based in the Los Angeles \/ Hollywood California area , and the bandmembers were as follows : Dave Hatlee ( bass ) , Rick Ness ( rhythm guitar ) and Saint Bongosto ( drums ) . Pappo y Widowmaker recorded a two-song EP in late 1989 and then embarked on tour back to South America in December 1989 . They performed several successful shows in venues such as Club Satisfaction in Buenos Aires and The Superdomo in Mar Del Plata in 1990 . Pappo 's other love was car racing . He raced in Argentina 's top stock-car category , Turismo Carretera , and in motorcycle races , with limited success . Pappo died in a road accident in LujÃ n , Buenos Aires province on 25 February 2005 . He went to dine out with his son Luciano and his son 's girlfriend . According to the restaurant owner , Pappo left the restaurant inebriated ; Luciano denies this allegation , claiming that the three drank no more than a single bottle of wine , so Pappo ( a long-time drinker ) could not have been intoxicated . At route 5 , km 71 , Pappo 's Harley-Davidson chopper touched Luciano 's motorcycle . Pappo lost control , fell to the ground , and a Renault Clio car traveling in the opposite direction ( LujÃ n to Mercedes ) hit him , causing his death .

The 2002 Formula One season was the 53rd FIA Formula One World Championship season . It commenced on March 3 , 2002 , and ended on October 13 after seventeen races . It appeared to be nothing more than a battle for second or third place in the driver 's standings for those competing because Michael Schumacher finished first or second in every race except for the Malaysian Grand Prix , where he finished third , making the podium in every race .

Schumacher took the Drivers ' Title by a record 67 point margin over teammate Rubens Barrichello , beating his own previous record for the 2001 season . Schumacher and Barrichello helped Ferrari amass more points than the rest of the constructors put together . For next season , the FIA would change the points system . The following teams and drivers competed in the 2002 FIA Formula One World Championship . â All engines were 3.0 litre , V10 configuration . The 2002 season featured several driver line-up changes before the season and more changes during the season proper .

Thirsk is a small market town and civil parish in the Hambleton district of North Yorkshire , England . The local travel links are located a mile from the town center to Thirsk railway station and 20 miles to Teesside International Airport ( Durham Tees Valley ) . Local bus services to and from York , Ripon and Northallerton and nearby villages and long distance National Express Coaches call at the bus stop in the market place . Also , the main road running through the town is the A61 , connecting Thirsk to Ripon . The parish has a population of 4,703 according to the 2001 Census . Thirsk is a popular tourist destination attracting visitors , especially with Thirsk Racecourse and the North York Moors . The town lies in the Vale of Mowbray , 23 miles north of York . Cod Beck runs through the center of Thirsk - the area to the east of the river is called Old Thirsk . The A19 road now , after a bypass was built in the 1960s , passes Thirsk to the east ; the former route of the A19 through the town is the A61 to the north to South Kilvington and the A170 to the south at the junction where the A19 joins the original route to the south . The town is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1089 as Tresche , derived from the Viking ( Old Norse ) word Ã 3\/4 resk = `` marsh '' . It is surrounded by a number of villages also having names of Danish origin , such as Thirlby , Boltby , Borrowby and Sowerby ( the - by suffix ( Danish in origin ) meaning village or farmstead ) . Thirsk is built around a large medieval market square , which still hosts an open-air market each Monday and Saturday . Thirsk has a museum and the 15th century church of St Mary 's . It is commonly thought that Thirsk also has a hospital , cinema , town hall and swimming pool , but all are actually in the adjoining village of Sowerby . Thirsk 's chief modern claim to fame is as the home of the veterinary surgeon and author James Herriot , although it was renamed `` Darrowby '' in the books . The veterinary practice at 23 Kirkgate , in which he was a partner along with Donald Sinclair ( Siegfried Farnon in the books ) now houses a museum dedicated to his life and works , The World of James Herriot . Thomas Lord , another Thirsk notable , who founded Lord 's cricket ground in London was born in a house which now houses the Thirsk Museum , also on Kirkgate . Another local attraction is the Kilburn White Horse , a chalk horse carved into the hillside about four miles east of the town in 1857 . The Ritz Cinema on Westgate , Sowerby is a small 200 seat ( 100 stalls , 100 balcony ) cinema run by volunteers . It dates back to 1912 and is one of Britain 's oldest operating cinemas . It shows in a period setting most of the current films and is run for residents and visitors to Thirsk and the local villages by a dedicated team of volunteers . The racecourse at Thirsk is a leading venue for horseracing on the flat in the spring and summer months .
The Australasian zone is an ecological region that is coincident , but not synonymous ( by some definitions ) , with the geographic region of Australasia . The ecozone includes Australia , the island of New Guinea ( including Papua New Guinea and the Indonesian province of Papua ) , and the eastern part of the Indonesian archipelago , including the island of Sulawesi , the Moluccan islands ( the Indonesian provinces of Maluku and North Maluku ) and islands of Lombok , Sumbawa , Sumba , Flores , and Timor , often known as the Lesser Sundas . The Australasian ecozone also includes several Pacific island groups , including the Bismarck Archipelago , Vanuatu , the Solomon Islands , and New Caledonia . New Zealand and its surrounding islands are a distinctive sub-region of the Australasian ecozone . The rest of Indonesia is part of the Indomalayan ecozone . Note that this zonation is based on flora ; animals do not necessarily follow the same biogeographic boundaries . In the present case , many birds occur in both `` Indomalayan '' and `` Australasian '' regions , but not across the whole of either . On the other hand , there are few faunistic commonalities shared only by Australia and New Zealand , except some birds . Meanwhile , Australia , Melanesia and the Wallacea are united by a large share of similar animals , but few of these occur farther into the Pacific -- but on the other hand , much of the Polynesian fauna is related to that of Melanesia .

A manhole ( alternatively utility hole , cable chamber , maintenance hole , inspection chamber , access chamber or confined space ) is the top opening to an underground utility vault used to house an access point for making connections or performing maintenance on underground and buried public utility and other services including sewers , telephone , electricity , storm drains and gas . It is protected by a manhole cover , also known as a ` biscuit ' , a plug designed to prevent accidental or unauthorized access to the manhole . Those plugs are usually made of metal or constructed from precast concrete ( especially in Europe ) . Manholes are usually outfitted with metal or polypropylene steps installed in the inner side of the wall to allow easy descent into the manhole . Manholes are generally found in urban areas , in streets and occasionally under sidewalks . They are usually in circular shape to prevent accidental fall of the cover in the hole . In rural and undeveloped areas , services such as telephone and electricity may be carried on pylons rather than underground . In urban areas , stray voltage issues have become a significant concern for utilities . In 2004 , Jodie S. Lane was electrocuted after stepping on a metal manhole cover , while walking her dog in New York City . One solution is the Electrified Cover Safeguard invention , which is an on site , real time stray voltage warning system which is being used in the street lights in New York City and is also being tested by ConEd and other utilities and municipalities in England , Europe , and Japan . In 1990 , the city of Sacramento , California officially renamed all their manholes to `` maintenance holes '' out of concern for the equality of both genders . The name `` maintenance hole '' was selected because the term shares the same initials as the word `` manhole '' , thereby eliminating the need to change the MH labels on the city 's utility maps .

In music , the range of a musical instrument is the distance from the lowest to the highest pitch it can play . For a singing voice , the equivalent is vocal range . The range of a musical part is the distance between its lowest and highest note . The terms sounding range , written range , designated range , duration range and dynamic range have specific meanings . The sounding range refers to the pitches produced by an instrument , while the written range refers to the compass ( span ) of notes written in the sheet music , where the part is sometimes transposed for convenience . A piccolo typically has a sounding range one octave higher than its written range . The designated range is the set of notes the player should or can achieve while playing . All instruments have a designated range , and all pitched instruments have a playing range . Timbre , dynamics , and duration ranges are interrelated and one may achieve registral range at the expense of timbre . The designated range is thus the range in which a player is expected to have comfortable control of all aspects . The duration range is the difference between the shortest and longest rhythm used . Dynamic range is the difference between the quietest and loudest volume of an instrument , part or piece of music . Although woodwind instruments and string instruments have no theoretical upper limit to their range ( subject to practical limits ) , they generally can not go below their designated range . Brass instruments , on the other hand , can play beyond their designated ranges . Notes lower than the brass instrument 's designated range are called pedal tones . The playing range of a brass instrument depends on both the technical limitations of the instrument and the skill of the player . Classical arrangements seldom make woodwind or brass instruments play beyond their designed range . String musicians play the bottom of their ranges very frequently , but the top of a string instrument 's range is rather fuzzy , and it is unusual for a string player to exceed the designated range . It is quite rare for wind musicians to play the extremes of their instruments . The most common exception is that in many 20th century works , pedal tones are called for in bass trombones . This chart uses standard numberings for octaves where middle C corresponds to C4 . In the MIDI language middle C is simply referred to as ` Middle C ' . The lowest note that a pipe organ can sound ( with a true pipe ) is C-1 ( or CCCCC ) , which is 8 Hz , not visible on this chart . However , if acoustic combination ( a note and its fifth ) counts , the lowest note is C-2 ( CCCCCC ) , which is 4 Hz .

The story of her murder was the inspiration for an Inspector Morse mystery first broadcast in 1998 , entitled The Wench is Dead . Swaffham is a market town and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk . The town is situated 20 k east of King 's Lynn and 50 k west of Norwich . The civil parish has an area of 29.57 k and in the 2001 census had a population of 6,935 in 3,130 households . For the purposes of local government , the parish falls within the district of Breckland . Its name came from Old English SwÇ # fa hÄ m = `` the homestead of the Swabians '' ; some of them presumably came with the Angles and Saxons . In the Domesday Book three lords were associated with Swaffham : Walter Giffard , with the largest manor ; his tenant Hugh Bolebec , who held all of the Giffard land there ; and Aubrey de Vere I , who held a smaller manor at Swaffham which the Domesday jurors said Aubrey had seized without the king 's permission . As the Bolebec estates passed into Vere hands through two marriages of Bolebec heiresses to Vere males in the late 12th and early 13th centuries , the two manors were combined and held by the Vere Earls of Oxford for several centuries . A Benedictine priory for female religious was founded at Swaffham Bolebec between circa 1150 and 1163 , probably by the Bolebecs . About 8 km to the north of Swaffham can be found the ruins of the formerly important Castle Acre Priory and Castle Acre Castle . By the 14th and 15th centuries Swaffham had a flourishing sheep and wool industry As a result of this prosperity , the town has a large market place . The Market Cross here was built by George Walpole , 3rd Earl of Orford and presented to the town in 1783 . On the top is the statue of Ceres , the Roman goddess of the harvest . On the west side of Swaffham Market Place are several old buildings which for many years housed the historic Hamond 's Grammar School , as a plaque on the wall of the main building explains . The Hamond 's Grammar School building latterly came to serve as the sixth form for the Hamond 's High School , but that use has since ceased . Harry Carter , the Grammar School 's art teacher of the 1960s , was responsible for a great number of the carved village signs that are now found in many of Norfolk 's towns and villages , most notably perhaps Swaffham 's own sign commemorating the legendary Pedlar of Swaffham , which is in the corner of the market place just opposite the old school 's gates . Harry was the nephew of the archaeologist Howard Carter . Until 1968 it had a railway station on the Great Eastern Railway line from King 's Lynn . Just after Swaffham , the line split into two , one branch heading south to Thetford , and the other west towards Dereham . The railways were closed as part of the Beeching Axe , through the possibility of rebuilding a direct rail link from Norwich to King 's Lynn via Swaffham is occasionally raised . The Swaffham Museum contains an exhibition on local history and local geology as well as an egyptology room . Today the town is known for the presence of two large Enercon E-66 wind turbines , and the associated Ecotech Centre . The turbines are owned and operated by Ecotricity , and together generate more than three megawatts . One wind turbine has an observation deck just below the nacelle . These have now been joined now by a further eight turbines at North Pickenham . The center hosted the 2008 British BASE jumping championships ; contestants jumped from the roof of the observation deck . In the summer of 2006 , location filming was done in the town for the ITV1 series Kingdom , starring Stephen Fry . In Kingdom the town is called Market Shipborough . The pub The Startled Duck in the TV series is better known as The Greyhound Inn in which the Earl of Orford created the first coursing club open to the public in 1776 . Kingdom 's office is filmed in Oakleigh House , near the town square ( formerly the house of the Head Master of Hamond 's Grammar School ) , with the coastal scenes filmed at Wells-next-the-Sea on the north Norfolk coast . The east-west A47 Birmingham to Great Yarmouth road now avoids the town , using a northerly bypass opened in 1981 .

The Limbourg brothers , or in Dutch Gebroeders van Limburg ( Herman , Paul , and Johan ; fl . 1385 -- 1416 ) , were famous Dutch miniature painters from the city of Nijmegen . They were active in the early 15th century in France and Burgundy , working in the style known as International Gothic . They created what is certainly the best known late medieval illuminated manuscript , the TrÃ s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry . The brothers ' grandfather , Johannes de Lymborgh probably came from Limbourg on the Meuse to Nijmegen , then the capital of the duchy of Gelre . Johannes son , Arnold , was a wood carver who worked for the ducal court . Around 1385 Arnold married Mechteld Maelwael or Maloeul , the daughter of a well-to-do family of heraldic painters . Herman ( Hermant in French sources ) was the eldest child ( born about 1385 ) , followed by Paul ( Polleke ; or Polequin in French sources : 1386 or 1387 ) , and Johan ( Johanneke ; or Jacquemin , Gillequin , or Jehanequin in French sources : probably 1388 ) . There were two younger brothers , Rutger and Arnold , and a sister , Greta . Around 1398 , after their father 's death , the brothers were sent for by their uncle Jean Malouel ( or Johan Maelwael , Jehan Maleuel in original French sources ) , the most important painter for the French and Burgundian courts of the time . Herman and Johan learned the craft of goldsmithing in Paris . At the end of 1399 they were traveling to visit Nijmegen but , due to a war , they were captured in Brussels . Since their mother could not pay the ransom of 55 gold escuz , the local goldsmiths ' guild started to collect the money . Eventually Philip the Bold paid the ransom for the sake of their uncle Malouel , his painter . The two boys were released in May , 1400 . From surviving documents it is known that in February 1402 Paul and Johan were contracted by Philip II to work for four years exclusively on illuminating a bible . This may or may not have been the Bible MoralisÃ e , Ms. fr .166 in the BibliothÃ que nationale de France in Paris , which is indisputably an early work by the Limbourg brothers . Philip II died , in 1404 , before the brothers had completed their work . Herman , Paul , and Johan later in 1404 came to work for John , Duke of Berry , a brother of the dead Philip . He was an extravagant collector of arts and especially books . Their first assignment was to illuminate a Book of Hours , now known as the Belles Heures du Duc de Berry ; it is preserved in The Cloisters of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City . This work was finished in 1409 much to the satisfaction of the duke , and he assigned them to an even more ambitious project for a Book of Hours . This became the TrÃ s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry , which is widely regarded as the peak of late medieval book illumination , and possibly the most valuable book in the world . It is kept as Ms. 65 in the MusÃ e CondÃ in Chantilly , France . Paul especially was on good terms with the duke , and received a court position as valet de chambre or personal attendant ( his uncle had had the same position with the Duke of Burgundy ) . The duke gave him jewelry and a big house in Bourges . Paul was attracted to a young girl , Gillette la MerciÃ re , but her parents disapproved . The duke had the girl confined , and released her only on the king 's command . In 1411 Paul and Gillette married anyway , but the marriage remained childless ( the girl was 12 , her husband 24 at the time ) . In the first half of 1416 , Jean de Berry and the three brothers Limbourg ( all three less than 30 years old ) died of unknown causes , the closeness of the deaths suggesting plague , and the TrÃ s Riches Heures remained unfinished . An unidentified artist ( possibly BarthÃ lemy van Eyck ) worked on the famous calendar miniatures in the 1440s when the book apparently was in the possession of RenÃ d'Anjou , and in 1485 Jean Colombe finished the work for the House of Savoy . The work of the Limbourg brothers , being mostly inaccessible , became forgotten until the 19th century . Nevertheless they set an example for the next generations of painters , which extended beyond miniature painting . They worked in a Northern European tradition , but display influences from Italian models .

Alexander III ( Medieval Gaelic : Alaxandair mac Alaxandair ; Modern Gaelic : Alasdair mac Alasdair ) ( â `` ) was King of Scots from 1249 to his death . Alexander was born at Roxburgh , the only son of Alexander II by his second wife Marie de Coucy . Alexander 's father died on 6 July 1249 and he became king at the age of eight , inaugurated at Scone on 13 July 1248 . The years of his minority featured an embittered struggle for the control of affairs between two rival parties , the one led by Walter Comyn , Earl of Menteith , the other by Alan Durward , Justiciar of Scotia . The former dominated the early years of Alexander 's reign . At the marriage of Alexander to Margaret of England in 1251 , Henry III of England seized the opportunity to demand from his son-in-law homage for the Scottish kingdom , but Alexander did not comply . In 1255 an interview between the English and Scottish kings at Kelso led to Menteith and his party losing to Durward 's party . But though disgraced , they still retained great influence , and two years later , seizing the person of the king , they compelled their rivals to consent to the erection of a regency representative of both parties . On attaining his majority at the age of 21 in 1262 , Alexander declared his intention of resuming the projects on the Western Isles which the death of his father thirteen years before had cut short . He laid a formal claim before the Norwegian king Haakon . Haakon rejected the claim , and in the following year responded with a formidable invasion . Sailing around the west coast of Scotland he halted off the Isle of Arran , and negotiations commenced . Alexander artfully prolonged the talks until the autumn storms should begin . At length Haakon , weary of delay , attacked , only to encounter a terrific storm which greatly damaged his ships . The Battle of Largs ( October 1263 ) proved indecisive , but even so , Haakon 's position was hopeless . Baffled , he turned homewards , but died in Orkney on 15 December 1263 . The Isles now lay at Alexander 's feet , and in 1266 Haakon 's successor concluded the Treaty of Perth by which he ceded the Isle of Man and the Western Isles to Scotland in return for a monetary payment . Norway retained only Orkney and Shetland in the area . In 1284 , Alexander invested the title of Lord of the Isles in the head of the Macdonald family , Angus Macdonald , and over the next two centuries the Macdonald lords operated as if they were kings in their own right , frequently opposing the Scottish monarch . Alexander had married Princess Margaret of England , a daughter of King Henry III of England and Eleanor of Provence , on 26 December 1251 . She died in 1274 , after they had three children : According to the Lanercost Chronicle , Alexander did not spend his decade as a widower alone : `` he used never to forbear on account of season nor storm , nor for perils of flood or rocky cliffs , but would visit none too creditably nuns or matrons , virgins or widows as the fancy seized him , sometimes in disguise . '' Towards the end of Alexander 's reign , the death of all three of his children within a few years made the question of the succession one of pressing importance . In 1284 he induced the Estates to recognize as his heir-presumptive his granddaughter Margaret , the `` Maid of Norway '' . The need for a male heir led him to contract a second marriage to Yolande de Dreux on 1 November 1285 . But the sudden death of the king dashed all such hopes . Alexander died in a fall from his horse in the dark while riding to visit the queen at Kinghorn in Fife on 19 March 1286 because it was her birthday the next day . He had spent the evening at Edinburgh Castle celebrating his second marriage and overseeing a meeting with royal advisors . He was advised by them not to make the journey over to Fife because of weather conditions , but traveled anyway . Alexander became separated from his guides and it is assumed that in the dark his horse lost its footing . The amount of alcohol he had would ' t have helped . The 44-year old king was found dead on the shore the following morning with a broken neck . Some texts have said that he fell off a cliff . Although there is no cliff at the site where his body was found there is a very steep rocky embankment - which would have been fatal in the dark . After Alexander 's death , his strong realm was plunged into a period of darkness that would eventually lead to war with England . Had Alexander , who was a strong monarch , lived , things might have worked out differently . He was buried in Dunfermline Abbey . As Alexander left no surviving children the heir to the throne was his unborn child by Queen Yolande . When Yolande 's pregnancy ended , probabably with a miscarriage , Alexander 's granddaughter Margaret became the heir . Margaret died , still uncrowned , on her way to Scotland in 1290 . The inauguration of John Balliol as king on 30 November 1292 ended the six years of interregnum when the Guardians of Scotland governed the land .

Vyacheslav Vsevolodovich Ivanov ( , born 21 August 1929 , Moscow ) is a prominent Soviet\/Russian philologist and Indo-Europeanist probably best known for his glottalic theory of Indo-European consonantism and for placing the Indo-European urheimat in the area of the Armenian Highlands and Lake Urmia . Vyacheslav Ivanov 's father was Vsevolod Ivanov , one of the most prominent Soviet writers . His mother was an actress who worked in the theater of Vsevolod Meyerhold . His childhood was clouded by disease and war , which he spent in Tashkent evacuation . Ivanov was educated at the Moscow University and worked there until 1958 , when he was fired on account of his sympathy with Boris Pasternak and Roman Jacobson . By that time , he had made some important contributions to Indo-European studies and became one of the leading authorities on Hittite language . During the early 1960s , Ivanov was one of the first Soviet scholars to take a keen interest in and develop semiotics . He worked with Vladimir Toporov on several linguistic monographs , including an outline of Sanskrit . In 1962 he joined Toporov and Juri Lotman in establishing the Tartu-Moscow Semiotic School . In the 1980s Ivanov worked with Tamaz Gamkrelidze on a new theory of Indo-European migrations , which was most recently advocated by them in Indo-European and Indo-Europeans ( 1995 ) . He led the All-Union Library of Foreign Literature between 1989 and 1993 and held a seat in the Supreme Soviet of Russia . Simultaneously , he established the Institute of World Culture and held a chair in Theory and History of World Culture at the Moscow University . Since the late 1990s Ivanov shares his time between Moscow ( where he teaches in the Russian State University for the Humanities ) and Los Angeles , where he delivers courses at the University of California , Los Angeles . He also worked as a professor in Stanford University and Yale University . He was made a full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1990 , and he has been a Foreign Fellow of the British Academy since 1977 .

A county seat is an administrative center for a county or civil parish , primarily used in the United States . In the Northeast United States , the statutory term often is shire town , but colloquially county seat is the term in use there . Parts of the Canadian Maritimes also use the term shire town . In England , Wales and Ireland , the term county town is used . This term is still sometimes used colloquially in Scotland and Northern Ireland , but today neither are divided into administrative counties â `` instead being divided , respectively , into council areas and districts . Louisiana uses parishes instead of counties , and the administrative center is a parish seat . Alaska is organized into `` boroughs '' , which are large districts , and the administrative center is known as a borough seat . United States counties , as in England and Canada , function as administrative subdivisions of a state and have no sovereign jurisdiction of their own , although some have authority to enact and enforce municipal ordinances . Counties administer state or provincial law at the local level as part of the decentralization of state\/provincial authority . In many U.S. states , state government is further decentralized by dividing counties into townships , to provide local government services to residents of the county who do not live in incorporated cities or towns . A county seat is usually , but not always , an incorporated municipality . The exceptions include , but are not limited to , the county seats of counties that have no incorporated municipalities within their borders , such as Arlington County , Virginia and Howard County , Maryland . ( Ellicott City , the county seat of Howard County , is the largest unincorporated county seat in the United States , followed by Towson , the county seat of Baltimore County , Maryland . ) The county courthouse and county administration are usually located in the county seat , but some functions may also be conducted in other parts of the county , especially if it is geographically large . In Virginia , there are 39 independent cities ( as of 2001 ) , which are legally distinct from the counties that surround them . An independent city interacts with the state government directly whereas towns , the only other type of municipal government authority in Virginia , do so through the county government apparatus . In many of Virginia 's counties , the county government offices are located within the independent cities of their neighboring counties . Also , for certain statistical purposes , some independent cities are considered part of the county from which they separated . For example , the City of Fairfax is separate from Fairfax County , the county 's offices lie within the city , and the city is combined with Fairfax County statistically . Similarly , the city of Baltimore , Maryland is also an independent city , and much like Fairfax , surrounded on three sides by a county of the same name . However , unlike Fairfax , `` Baltimore City '' , as it is officially known , is not politically or statistically connected with surrounding Baltimore County . Besides Baltimore City and the independent cities of Virginia , there are only two other independent cities in the United States : St. Louis , Missouri ; and Carson City , Nevada . Several other cities , among them San Francisco , California ; Philadelphia , Pennsylvania ; Denver , Colorado ; Louisvile , Kentucky ; Indianapolis , Indiana ; Augusta , Georgia ; and New Orleans , Louisiana , are all a city and a county ( or in the case of Louisiana , a parish ) , with a consolidated government . In all of the named cities except for Augusta , Indianapolis , Louisville , and New Orleans , the city and county names are identical ; Augusta is coextensive with Richmond County , as are Indianapolis with Marion County , Louisville with Jefferson County , and New Orleans with Orleans Parish . Similar to Virginia , the Canadian province of Ontario has 17 separated municipalities which are municipalities that interact directly with the province without an intermediary county . Although administratively and legally separate from the county , many of these cities still serve as the seat of the county that surrounds them . Ontario also has several single-tier municipalities , many of which serve as a single county government with no lower municipal governments below it . In these cases , the county effectively is the local government in these areas , with a community in the county assigned as the seat , even though it has no municipal government of its own . Most counties have only one county seat . However , some counties in Alabama , Arkansas , Iowa , Kentucky , Massachusetts , Mississippi , Missouri , New Hampshire , New York , North Carolina , and Vermont have two or more county seats , usually located on opposite sides of the county . An example is Harrison County , Mississippi , which lists both Biloxi and Gulfport as county seats . The practice of multiple county seat towns dates from the days when travel was difficult . There have been few efforts to eliminate the two-seat arrangement , since a county seat is a source of pride ( and jobs ) for the towns involved . . The state with the greatest number of counties is Texas , with 254 .
The British Rail Class 487 electric multiple units were built by English Electric in 1940 , for use on the Waterloo & City Line . Twelve motor carriages ( DMBSO ) , numbered 51 â `` 62 , and sixteen trailers ( TSO ) , numbered 71 â `` 86 , were built . Trains were formed of various formations , from a single motor carriage , to pairs of motor cars with up to three intermediate trailers . They were originally classified Class 453 under TOPS but were later reclassified Class 487 . The Waterloo & City Line was operated as part of the BR Southern Region . Stock was painted in British Railways green livery , which was replaced by BR Blue in the 1970s . In 1986 , the line came under the ownership of Network SouthEast , and their blue , red and white livery was applied . By the 1990s the units were urgently in need of replacing . This came in the form of new Class 482 two-car units , which were delivered to traffic in 1992\/93 . The final Class 487 vehicles were taken by road to Glasgow for scrap , which was their single longest journey above ground . The Class 487 units were unique on the British Rail network in not requiring yellow ends because the route they operated did not integrate at all with the rest of the network . One vehicle , DMBSO no. 61 , was initially stored at the National Railway Museum in York , before being subsequently transferred to the London Transport Museum 's Acton Depot .
The FIFA Club World Cup is a football competition between the champion clubs from all six continental confederations . The first FIFA Club World Championship took place in Brazil in January 2000 . It ran in parallel with the Intercontinental Cup , contested annually since 1960 by the winners of the European Cup and the South American Copa Libertadores , until the two merged in 2005 . The 2000 FIFA Club World Championship , held in Brazil , consisted of eight qualifiers : the six continental champions , the 1998 Intercontinental Champions and the host nation champions . The tournament was controversial , most notably in England where Manchester United had to withdraw from a national cup competition , the FA Cup , in order to compete . The launch of the competition was understood by some to be part of a struggle between FIFA and UEFA , who were competing for control of international club football : the existing Intercontinental Cup was outside of FIFA 's jurisdiction . The final was competed between the two Brazilian sides and the winner was Corinthians in a penalty shoot-out over Clube de Regatas Vasco da Gama . The second competition was penciled in for Spain in 2001 , to feature 12 teams . This was canceled owing to a combination of factors , most importantly the collapse of FIFA 's marketing partner ISL . It was then intended to hold the event in 2003 , but this also failed to happen . FIFA eventually agreed to terms with the UEFA to merge the two competitions . The final Intercontinental Cup was in 2004 , with the first installment of the relaunched Club World Championship Toyota Cup held in Japan between December 11 and December 18 , 2005 . The 2005 relaunched version was shorter than the previous World Championship , reducing the problem of scheduling the tournament around the different club seasons across each continent . It contained just the six reigning continental champions , with the CONMEBOL and UEFA champions receiving byes to the semi-finals of the tournament . A completely new trophy was introduced , replacing all previous cups : the Intercontinental trophy , the Toyota trophy and the trophy won by Corinthians in 2000 . The competition was then renamed as FIFA Club World Cup for the 2006 event , which was held annually in Japan until 2008 . The United Arab Emirates hosted the event in 2009 and 2010 . For the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup , a play-off match between the OFC champions and the host-nation champions for entry into the quarter-final stage was introduced in order to increase home interest in the tournament . The reintroduction of the match for fifth place for the 2008 competition also prompted an increase in prize money by US$ 500,000 to a total of US$ 16.5 million . The winners took away $ 5 million , second-placed team received $ 4 million , the third-placed team $ 2.5 million , the fourth-placed team $ 2 million , the fifth-placed team $ 1.5 million , the sixth-placed team $ 1 million and the seventh-placed team received $ 500,000 . In February 2008 a FIFA Club World Cup Champions Badge was introduced , featuring an image of the trophy , which the reigning champion is entitled to display on its kit until the final of the next championship . Initially , all four previous champions were allowed to wear the badge until the 2008 final , where Manchester United gained the sole right to wear the badge by winning the trophy . The teams with the most appearances in the competition are Al-Ahly of Egypt and Pachuca of Mexico who have played in three out of the six tournaments held â `` 2005 , 2006 and 2008 for Al-Ahly and 2007 , 2008 and 2010 for Pachuca . For each team , the winners received $ 5 million , the second-placed team takes $ 4 million , the third-placed team $ 2.5 million , the fourth-placed team $ 2 million , the fifth-placed team $ 1.5 million , the sixth-placed team $ 1 million and the seventh-placed team received $ 500,000 . The cup 's main sponsor is Toyota .

A rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of cancer , specifically a sarcoma ( cancer of connective tissues ) , in which the cancer cells are thought to arise from skeletal muscle progenitors . It can also be found attached to muscle tissue , wrapped around intestines , or in any anatomic location . Most occur in areas naturally lacking in skeletal muscle , such as the head , neck , and genitourinary tract . Its two most common forms are embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma . In the former , which is more common in younger children , the cancer cells resemble those of a typical 6-to-8-week embryo . In the latter , which is more common in older children and teenagers , they resemble those of a typical 10-to-12-week embryo . Rhabdomyosarcoma is a relatively rare form of cancer . It is most common in children ages one to five , and is also found in teens aged 15 to 19 , although this is more rare . This cancer is also an adult cancer but it is rare . St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital reports that rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children . Soft tissue sarcomas make up about 3 % of childhood cancers . The diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma is made by a pathologist , a physician who specializes in the diagnosis of disease . The pathologist will examine a biopsy of the tumor under the microscope and arrive at the diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma based on the morphology ( appearance ) of the tumor cells and the results of immunohistochemical stains . Diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma depends on recognition of differentiation toward skeletal muscle cells . The proteins myoD1 and myogenin are transcription factor proteins normally found in developing skeletal muscle cells which disappears after the muscle matures and becomes innervated by a nerve . Thus , myoD1 and myogenin are not usually found in normal skeletal muscle and serve as a useful immunohistochemical marker of rhabdomyosarcoma . Early manifestation can be misdiagnosed as a pseudotumor that is non responsive to steroid treatment . Several different histological subtypes of rhabdomyosarcoma exist , each of which has different clinical and pathological characteristics . Prognosis and clinical behavior of the tumor is also partially dependent on histologic subtype . Multiple classification systems have been proposed for subclassifying these tumors . The most recent classification system , the `` International Classification of Rhabdomyosarcoma '' , was created by the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study . This system attempts to combined elements of the previous systems and correlate these with prognosis based on tumor type . Several additional subtypes of rhabdomyosarcoma exist that do not fit into the International Classification scheme . Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma usually occurs in adults rather than children , and , thus , is not included in this system . Sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare rhabdomyosarcoma subtype recently characterized by Folpe , et al ; it is not included in this system . Although botryoid and spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma are classically considered as subtypes of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma , they have more favorable clinical behavior and prognosis than classic embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma . Treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma consists of chemotherapy , radiation therapy and sometimes surgery . Surgery to remove the tumor may be difficult or impossible depending on the location of the tumor . If there is no evidence of metastasis , surgery combined with chemotherapy and radiation offers the best prognosis . Patients whose tumors have not metastasized usually have a good chance for long-term survival , depending on the subtype of the tumor . St Jude 's Children 's Research Hospital reports that more than 70 % of children diagnosed with localized rhabdomyosarcoma have long-term survival . A study has shown a link between RMS and Tungsten alloy embedded in muscle ( e.g. shrapnel ) . However , the tungsten alloy contained 6 % Nickel and 3 % Cobalt , which are known carcinogens . A synergistic effect of alloying tungsten with Ni and Co is suggested ( i.e. increasing the toxicity relative to either of the pure metals ) .
Parbayse is a commune in the PyrÃ nÃ es-Atlantiques department in south-western France .
Microvenator ( meaning `` tiny hunter '' ) is a genus of dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous Cloverly Formation in what is now south central Montana . Microvenator was an Oviraptorosaurian theropod . The holotype fossil is an incomplete skeleton , most likely a juvenile , with a living length of about four feet . The adult size of Microvenator is estimated to be closer to 10 feet long . Microvenator celer is primitive and may be the `` sister taxon to all other oviraptorosaurs . '' Barnum Brown collected the type specimen ( AMNH 3041 ) of this animal in 1933 . Interestingly , he included what are now known to be Deinonychus teeth with the specimen , and thought that his new animal had a small body with an unusually large head . Thus , he informally dubbed it `` Megadontosaurus '' ( `` big-toothed lizard '' ) . He had illustrations made of it , but never published the name , a fate shared with several other Cloverly dinosaurs ( Deinonychus , Sauropelta , Tenontosaurus ) . AMNH 3041 includes parts of the skull . hand , foot , left fibula , 23 vertebrae , 4 ribs , and fairly complete ilia , pubes , femora , tibiae , the left ankle , left humerus , radius , and ulna . In 1970 John Ostrom described the type specimen and gave it its formal name . Ostrom also referred a single tooth from the Yale Peabody Museum collection , YPM 5366 , to this new species . The illustrations that Brown had prepared were finally published in a detailed and exhaustive monograph by Mackovicky and Sues in 1998 . They were unable to confirm that YPM 5366 belongs to Microvenator . They confirmed that Microvenator is an oviraptorosaurian , and that it is the earliest known member of this group from North America .
Boeil-Bezing is a commune in the PyrÃ nÃ es-Atlantiques department in south-western France .
Villars-les-Dombes is a commune in the Ain department in eastern France . Its people are known as Villardois . The town is in the part of Ain which is half-way between Lyon ( 33 km ) and Bourg-en-Bresse ( 29 km ) , in the heart of the area known as the Dombes , notable for its hundreds of lakes which are suited to fish-rearing as well as to water fowls . Its ornithological park , with a wide variety of species from around the world , is the largest in France . The Chalaronne forms part of the commune 's south-western border , flows northward through the western part of the commune , crosses the town , then forms part of its northern border . The lordship of Villars ( of which archival evidence dates from 940 ) became , by marriage , the lordship of Thoire-et-Vilars in 1188 , and in about 1400 its caput was TrÃ voux ( the estate was managed from there ) . In 1565 , Villars was promoted to a marquisate dependent on the house of Savoie ( Savoy ) , a benefice of the Honour of Savoy . In 1705 , the marÃ chal de Villars obtained the collection of several lands , a small French enclave in the ( German-influenced ) province of Franche-Comt Ã , as the duchy of Villars . His line died out in 1788 , on the death of his son , HonorÃ - Armand , 2nd Duke de Villars .

George II ( died 1585 ) , of the Bagrationi Dynasty , was a king of Imereti from 1565 to 1585 . He succeeded on the death of his father , Bagrat III . With his ascend to the throne , George found himself involved in the civil war among the princes of western Georgia . He sided with his nominal vassal , Prince George II Gurieli of Guria , against Levan II Dadiani , the energetic ruler of Mingrelia . The latter allied himself with Prince Varaz Chiladze , and attempted , in 1568 , to oust George II in favor of the royal cousin , Khosro . The king emerged victorious and , together with the prince of Guria , took control of Mingrelia . Levan fled to Istanbul and , with an Ottoman support , resumed the throne , forcing Gurieli to plea for peace . Later , the two princes forged an alliance and revolted against the king . The western Georgian princes became engulfed into havoc of feudal warfare , mounting and disbanding alliances , and raiding the rival fiefdoms . In addition to the civil strife , the Ottomans also increased their pressure upon the Kingdom of Imereti . Although George II was able to block the advance of the Turkish commander Lala Mustafa Pasha from eastern Georgia in 1578 , he had to submit to the sultanâ s order and , in 1581 , at the head of a combined Imeretian-Mingrelian-Gurian army , raided the eastern Georgian kingdom of Kartli whose ruler , Simon I , waged a relentless guerrilla warfare against the Ottoman invaders .
Bacterial microcompartments are widespread bacterial organelles that are made of a protein shell that surrounds and encloses various enzymes . These compartments are typically about 100-200 nanometres across and made of interlocking proteins . They do not contain lipids since they are not surrounded by a membrane . Protein-enclosed compartments are also found in eukaryotes , such as the mysterious vault complex . The shells of diverse microcompartments are composed of members of three protein families : the BMC domain protein family , the inconsistently named CsoS4 \/ CcmL \/ EutN \/ OrfAB family , and the encapsulins\/linocin-like proteins . In microcompartment shells that have been studied , the major constituents are proteins belonging to the Bacterial Micro-Compartment ( BMC ) family . The crystal structures of a number of BMC proteins have been determined and invariably reveal assembly into cyclical hexamers with a small pore in the center . Recent structures have revealed either a pentameric or hexameric structure in this family . In icosahedral or quasi-icosahedral carboxysomes , it is likely that the pentameric form is positioned at the vertices . Encapsulins are a large and widely-distributed family of proteins and are present in most bacteria and have been identified in Candidatus methanoregula , a species of archaea . They were originally called linocin-like proteins and thought to be a group of bacterial antibiotics , since they showed bacteriostatic activity in culture . However , structural analysis showed these to form a spherical nanocompartment that contains enzymes involved in the defenses against oxidative stress . A recent survey indicated seven different metabolic systems encapsulated by microcompartment shells . Three are characterized : Carboxysomes encapsulate RuBisCo and carbonic anhydrase in carbon-fixing bacteria as part of a carbon concentrating mechanism . Some bacteria can used 1,2-propanediol as a carbon source . They express a microcompartment to encapsulate a number of enzymes used in this pathway . The Pdu compartment is constructed by a set of 21 genes in a single chromosomal locus . These genes are sufficient for assembly of the microcompartment since they can be transferred between bacteria and will produce a functional structure in the recipient . EUT microcompartments are proposed to form in Salmonella species , and may be involved in the metabolism of ethanolamine .
The Isle of Man Government is the government of the Isle of Man . The formal head of the Isle of Man Government is the Lieutenant Governor , representing HM Queen Elizabeth II , Lord of Mann . The executive head is the Chief Minister . Douglas , the largest town on the Isle of Man is its capital and seat of government , where the Government offices and the parliament chambers ( Tynwald ) are located . The Civil Service has more than 2000 employees and the total number of public sector employees including the Civil Service , teachers , nurses , police , etc is about 9000 people . This is somewhat more than 10 % of the population of the Island , and a full 23 % of the working population . This does not include any military forces , as defense is the responsibility of the United Kingdom . The Government consists of nine departments , ten statutory boards and three offices all reporting to the Council of Ministers . The departments all report directly to the Council of Ministers . Statutory boards and offices are listed below the Department to which they report . Before modern times the government of the Isle of Man was in the hands of the Governor ( or Lieutenant Governor ) , who was the representative of the Lord of Man , assisted by his Council , consisting of the other permanent officials ( the Bishop , Archdeacon , Deemsters , Attorney General , etc. ) . The Council evolved into the Legislative Council , the upper chamber of Tynwald , the parliament of the Isle of Man . After the Revestment in 1765 the Lieutenant Governor and his officials were the agents of the British Government , and not democratically responsible to the Manx people . Conflict between the House of Keys ( popularly elected after 1866 ) and the Lieutenant Governor came to a head during the tenure of Lord Raglan ( 1902 â `` 18 ) . After World War I the Lieutenant Governor gradually ceded control to Tynwald , a process guided by the reports of commissions and other bodies in 1911 , 1959 and 1969 . An Executive Council , chaired by him and including members of Tynwald , was established in 1949 , and gradually thereafter became the effective government of the Island . Finance and the police came under local control between 1958 and 1976 . The Lieutenant Governor ceased to chair the Executive Council in 1980 , being replaced by a chairman elected by Tynwald , and the Council was reconstituted in 1985 to include the chairmen of the eight principal Boards ; in 1986 they were given the title ` Minister ' and the chairman was styled ` Chief Minister ' . In 1990 the Council was renamed the ` Council of Ministers ' . During the 19th century several bodies , which came to be known as ` Boards of Tynwald ' , were created to exercise functions under democratic control . These included the Board of Education ( 1872 ) , Highway Board ( 1874 ) , Asylums Board ( 1888 ) , Government Property Trustees ( 1891 ) and Local Government Board ( 1894 ) . However , although direct taxation was levied by Tynwald , the Boards ' freedom of action before the 1960s was limited by the Lieutenant Governor 's control of the Island 's budget and his power to appoint certain of their members . The structure of the Boards of Tynwald , along with other bodies variously called ` Statutory Boards ' and ` Commercial Boards ' , became increasingly unwieldy after the 1950s , and was eventually reformed in the 1980s , when a system of ` ministerial government ' was set up . Until 1 April 2010 the Departments were as follows . Created in 1985-87 , they were the successors of the former Boards of Tynwald . The structure and functions of the Departments were re-organised with effect from 1 April 2010 . The existing Departments , except the Treasury and the Departments of Education and Home Affairs , were dissolved , and the Department of Education was renamed `` the Department of Education and Children '' . The Departments and their functions are now as follows : As noted above , a number of ` Statutory Boards ' and ` Commercial Boards ' were created at various times . Some were subsumed in the Departments in 1985-1987 , but others continued as separate Statutory Boards after 1987 :
The 1962 Tube Stock was a type of London Underground tube train built for use on the Central line . They were used on the Central line between 1962 and 1995 . The 1962 Stock was built by Birmingham RC&W for use on the Central Line . Each unit consisted of four vehicles ; two outer driving motors ( DM ) , an intermediate trailer ( T ) , and an intermediate non-driving motor ( M ) , formed DM + T + M + DM . A train usually consisted of two units working in multiple . The 1962 Stock was ordered as a matter of urgency to replace the Standard Stock previously used on the Central line . Two fires on Standard Stock units ( in 1958 and 1960 ) resulted in the hospitalisation of dozens of passengers . This experience , plus rapidly increasing numbers of breakdowns , hastened the need to replace these trains ( which dated back to the 1920s ) . The 1962 Stock units were virtually identical to the earlier 1959 Stock units , which were built for the Piccadilly Line . The original plan for the Central Line was to build new stock based on the prototype 1960 Stock . However , in the end , lack of time and funds prevented this , so the 1962 Stock was ordered as cheaper alternative , by using a proven design . The first complete 1962 Stock train entered passenger service on 12 April 1962 , with all trains in service by 1964 . By the early 1990s , the 1962 Stock was due for replacement . This came in the form of the new 1992 Stock , which was developed from the prototype 1986 Stock . The last unit on the Central Line was withdrawn on 17 February 1995 , although some were transferred to the Northern Line to allow the withdrawal of the non-standard 1956 Stock units . However , their use on the Northern Line was short-lived , as they were soon replaced by the 1995 Stock , and the final unit was withdrawn on 11 November 1999 . Several units remain in use as departmental vehicles . In addition , two units ( eight-car unit 1416 +1491 , and unit 1744 ) were sold to the Epping Ongar Railway , but were scrapped after being destroyed by vandals while stabled at Ongar . One complete unit was preserved by Cravens Heritage Trains in 1995 and is being restored at Hainault depot .
He has two children with his wife , Racheal . Joseph Yobo ( born 6 September 1980 in Kono , Nigeria ) is a Nigerian footballer who currently plays as a center back for FenerbahÃ e S.K. in the Turkish SÃ 1\/4 per Lig on loan from Everton . He also has 75 caps for the Nigerian national team . He is the younger brother of former Nigeria international Albert Yobo . In July 2008 , his younger brother Norum was kidnapped in Port Harcourt , Rivers State , Nigeria and held for ransom . He was eventually released after 12 days on 17 July 2008 . Yobo was born in Kono , but he grew up in Port Harcourt and is close friends with Crewe Alexandra 's George Abbey with whom he grew up . He later consulted with Abbey when deciding whether to move to England . Yobo left Nigeria to join Standard LiÃ ge in 1998 . He made his first team debut in 2000 , and went on to appear 46 times . In 2001 , he was bought by Marseille . Soon after making his debut , Yobo was loaned to Tenerife . After around nine months , Yobo returned to Marseille , before joining Everton , again on loan , in July 2002 . A Â # 1 million fee was required to register the player , and he became the first signing of David Moyes . An option to make the move permanent was taken up and completed in 2003 after a dispute between Yobo and Marseille was settled , with Everton agreeing a fixed additional fee of Â # 4 million . Yobo became one of the most consistent players in the Everton squad , and was one of only seven players in the entire league to play every minute of every game throughout the 2006 â `` 07 season . The delay , in 2006 , in signing a new contract with Everton lead to rumors of a move to Arsenal , but on 22 July , Yobo committed himself to Goodison Park until 2010 . As of 15 April 2007 , Yobo is the record appearance holder for an overseas player at Everton . For the UEFA Cup match against Larissa of Greece on 25 October 2007 , Yobo was named as captain in the absence of Phil Neville and thus became the first African to captain the club . On 6 May 2009 , Yobo scored his first goal of the season against West Ham United to seal a 3 â `` 1 win . In the 2009 â `` 10 season , Yobo had to adjust to his new defensive partner , Sylvain Distin , after Joleon Lescott left and Phil Jagielka became injured . On 29 November 2009 , he scored an own goal in Everton 's 2 â `` 0 defeat to Liverpool in the Merseyside Derby . Distin , Jagielka and John Heitinga have recently been selected over Yobo , confining him to the bench for most matches . On 31 August 2010 , having fallen out of favor at Goodison Park , it was confirmed by Everton that Yobo had moved to FenerbahÃ e on a season-long loan with an option to purchase him at the end of that period for Â # 5 million . He made his debut in a 2-0 defeat to Kayserispor and was later taken off injured . The Nigerian international played in the Super Eagles ' three matches in Japan and South Korea , for the 2002 World Cup , and even provided the assist for his side 's only goal of the tournament .

The entire coast line of Franklin County was inhabited by Native Americans for about 12,000 years . Life along the coast was good since seafood was abundant . They traded with the Native Americans in Tallahassee for clay and other items not available on the coast . One style of pottery first found in Carrabelle is named Carrabelle Punctuated . A clay pot was made , and while still damp the potter would take a small stick of similar object , and press the end of the stick into the clay numerous times until the entire pot was covered with small indentations . It was then placed into a shallow pit , covered with small tree branches which were set on fire . The result was a decorated water resistant pot .

Wezembeek-Oppem is a municipality in the Belgian province of Flemish Brabant , ten kilometres east of the center of Brussels . The municipality only comprises the town of Wezembeek-Oppem proper . On January 1 , 2006 Wezembeek-Oppem had a total population of 13,504 . The total area is 6.82 kmÂ which gives a population density of 1,980 inhabitants per kmÂ . Wezembeek-Oppem is home to a large community of international expatriates , in part because of the presence of the Internationale Deutsche Schule BrÃ 1\/4 ssel ( iDSB ) in Wezembeek-Oppem itself , and the British School in nearby Tervuren . Wezembeek-Oppem is one of the six municipalities with language facilities in the Flemish Region surrounding the Brussels-Capital Region . As the only one of these , Wezembeek-Oppem does not border Brussels directly since a narrow landstrip belonging to the municipality of Kraainem lies in between . When the last official language census was taken in 1947 , just under 30 % of the population in Wezembeek-Oppem had French as their mother tongue . In 1963 , when the official language border was finalized in Belgium , the municipality was designed as officially Dutch-speaking , however with facilities for French-speakers . In 1993 , when Belgium was turned into a federation , the municipality was included in the newly-established Flemish Region . The official language is Dutch ( as everywhere in Flanders ) , but the facility status means citizens have the right to request official documents from the local administration in French , may get primary school education in French as well as certain other public services . During the Nazi German occupation in the Second World War , Wezembeek was the home of an orphanage set up by the Association of Belgian Jews ( AJB ) , a Judenrat-like authority forcibly organised by the German occupational force and collaboratiing with the Nazis . The orphanage was for Jewish children who had been orphaned because their parents were sent to death camps . From August 1944 , the AJB decided to revolt and hid the children until the end of the occupation . When the school was again taken over by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge , the children hid in the basement until the US Army liberated them .

Newsround ( originally called John Craven 's Newsround , before the departure of Craven ) is a BBC children 's news program , which has run continuously since 4 April 1972 , and was one of the world 's first television news magazines aimed specifically at children . Initially commissioned as a short series by BBC Children 's Department , who held editorial control , its facilities are provided by BBC News . The program is aimed at 6 to 12-year-olds . Originally known as John Craven 's Newsround , it was mostly presented by John Craven between 4 April 1972 and 22 June 1989 . Originally , stand-in presenters came from main BBC News bulletins , including Richard Whitmore . By the 1980s , the program had developed its own presentation team including Roger Finn and Helen Rollason with Craven in the dual role of chief presenter and program editor . Shortly before Craven 's departure , the show was renamed Newsround , and was now anchored by a rotating team of presenters . Past presenters have included David Bull , Juliet Morris , Krishnan Guru-Murthy , Julie Etchingham , Chris Rogers , Kate Sanderson , Matthew Price , and Becky Jago . Regular reporters on the program , who have also presented it , include Paul McDowell , Paul Welsh , Lizo Mzimba and Terry Baddoo . The distinctive opening theme used for the first fifteen years of the program was not composed especially for it , but is instead the opening eight bars of a 1968 cover of Johnny One Note by Ted Heath and his Music . The closing sting used the last couple of bars of New Worlds by John Baker , recorded by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop . Newsround was the first British television program to break the news of the loss of the Space Shuttle Challenger on 28 January 1986 . As the event was shown during the opening titles , it is often erroneously stated that the tragedy happened live on air , but it in fact happened about fifteen minutes earlier . This edition was presented by Roger Finn , who had only recently joined the program . The program was also first in Britain to report an assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in Vatican City in 1981 and provided the first reports from the Windsor Castle fire of November 1992 . In February 2002 , Newsround expanded from a sole ten-minute program on weeknights to through-the-day bulletins seven days a week to tie-in with the launch of the CBBC Channel . In 2009 , a small bureau for the program was opened at the BBC 's Manchester studios . Newsround , along with the rest of the BBC Children 's Department , is expected to move to the new MediaCityUK development at Salford Quays by 2011 . On weekdays , a two-minute bulletin airs at the start of the CBBC Channel 's transmission at 7am . One-minute bulletins are broadcast on BBC Two at 7:25 am . Five-minute bulletins air on the CBBC Channel at 8:25 am & 6:25 pm . Recently , Newsround introduced a number of short 60 second bulletins in addition to the other digital updates , shown at 3.25 pm , 4.25 pm and 5.45 pm on the CBBC Channel . The main ten-minute edition of Newsround airs on BBC One at 5:05 pm . Bulletins are also broadcast on the CBBC Channel during the morning on weekend . A variation on the regular format of Newsround is a series of short ( typically 15-minute ) documentary films , previously broadcast under the title Newsround Extra but now called `` specials '' , which have been a regular feature since the late 1970s . Two or three series of these documentaries air during the year , which replace the regular bulletins on one day of the week ( for Extras it was usually Monday , although sometimes on Fridays , particularly during the 1980s ) . A one-off Newsround Investigates documentary on arson in schools was broadcast in May 2006 . A light-hearted entertainment news round-up , originally known as Newsround Lite and introduced as part of the CBBC Channel 's launch in February 2002 . The latter version of the show was hosted by regular Newsround presenters\/reporters Lizzie Greenwood-Hughes , Adam Fleming , Rachel Horne & Thalia Pellegrini and produced by SinÃ ad Rocks . The program was axed in 2005 . A Saturday morning sports magazine show introduced in September 2005 , it was canceled in December 2010 and replaced by MOTD Kickabout . In 2010 it was presented by Ore Oduba with reporters Des Clarke and Jon Franks . Until 2006 , a half-hour review of the year special was produced for broadcast during the Christmas\/New Year period .
A lay clerk , also known as a lay vicar , song man or a vicar choral , is a professional adult singer ( or an accomplished amateur ) in a Cathedral or ( occasionally ) collegiate choir in the United Kingdom . The Vicars Choral were substitutes for the Canons . They are not in holy orders ; the term `` vicar '' in this context comes from Latin word `` vice '' ( `` in place of '' ) and simply means a deputy ( as in vice-president ) . The majority of lay clerks are male . However there are female lay clerks in Dublin . The title refers to the laymen who were employed to sing musical sections of church services during the Middle Ages . At the time , this was often music which was evolving into a format too complicated to be sung by many ordinary clerks and priests . With the post-war proliferation of Cathedral choral scholarships , however , many Cathedral or collegiate choirs comprise a balance between choral scholars ( or , as at New College , Oxford and Magdalen College , Oxford , `` academical clerks '' ) -- university or `` gap year '' students who combine their studies or other commitments with singing -- and lay clerks . Choral scholars sing alongside lay clerks for usually around half the latters ' salary . Many universities now offer such scholarships to fill places within college and Cathedral choirs .

A duchy is a territory , fief , or domain ruled by a duke or duchess . Some duchies were sovereign in areas that would become unified realms only during the Modern era ( such as Germany and Italy ) . In contrast , others were subordinate districts of those kingdoms that unified either partially or completely during the Medieval era ( such as England , France , and Spain ) . For the history of duchies as an institution , see the entry on Duke . Traditionally , a grand duchy , such as Luxembourg , was generally independent and sovereign . Sovereign duchies were common in the Holy Roman Empire and German-speaking areas . In France , a number of duchies existed in the medieval period . Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom still claims the medieval French title of Duke of Normandy in relation to her ownership of the Channel Islands . Other important French duchies included Burgundy , Brittany , and Aquitaine . The mediÃ val German Stem duchies ( German : Stammesherzogtum , literally `` tribal duchy '' ) were associated with the Frankish Kingdom and corresponded with the areas of settlement of the major Germanic tribes . They formed the nuclei of the major feudal states that comprised the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation . These were Schwaben , Bayern and Sachsen in pre-Carolingian times , to which Franken and Lothringen were added in post-Carolingian times . In medieval England , the territories of Lancashire and Cornwall were made duchies , with certain powers accruing to their dukes . The Duchy of Lancaster was created in 1351 but became merged with the Crown when , in 1399 , the duke , Henry Bolingbroke ascended the throne of England as Henry IV . Nowadays the Duchy of Lancaster always belongs to the sovereign and its revenue is the Privy Purse . The Duchy of Cornwall was created in 1337 and held successively by the dukes of Cornwall who were also heirs to the throne . Nowadays the Duchy of Cornwall belongs to the sovereign 's heir apparent , if any : it reverts to the Crown in the absence of an heir apparent , and is automatically conferred to the heir apparent upon birth . These duchies today have lost their political role ( although there is an ongoing dispute over the status of Cornwall ) , but generate their holders ' private income . During the Wars of the Roses , the Duke of York made a successful entry into the City of York , by merely claiming no harm and that it was his right to possess `` his duchy of York '' . Any and all feudal duchies that made up the patchwork of England have since been absorbed within the Royal Family . Other than Cornwall and Lancaster , British royal dukedoms are titular and do not include land holdings . Non-royal dukedoms are associated with ducal property , but this is meant as the duke 's private property , with no other feudal privileges attached . In more recent times territorial duchies have become rare ; most dukedoms conferred in the last few centuries have been of a purely symbolic character ( see Duke ) . No independent duchy exists today , except for Luxembourg , which is an independent country formally called a grand duchy .

The second Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament ( known as the Gillette Tri-Nations due to sponsorship ) was contested between 16 October and 27 November of 2004 . The format of the competition differed from the previous event in that the teams played each other twice , rather than once , prior to the final . The tournament final of the tournament was predicted by some to be a close affair , with the British team heralded as slight favorites after finishing at the top of the league table . Instead , it was a one-sided match as Australia produced their best performance of the tournament . The game was effectively over by half-time when Australia led by 38-0 . During the series , Australia and New Zealand played additional Tests against France . A one off match was also played between an ANZAC side made up of touring Australian and New Zealand players and a Cumbira side .

Licensed to Ill is the debut album by the Beastie Boys , released in 1986 . It is the first hip hop LP to top the Billboard 200 chart . It is Columbia Records ' fastest selling debut record to date and sold over 9 million copies . Kerry King of Slayer made an appearance on the album playing lead guitar on `` Fight For Your Right '' and `` No Sleep Till Brooklyn '' , and appeared in the music video for the latter , which is a parody of glam metal . The name of the song itself is a spoof on MotÃ rhead 's No Sleep 'til Hammersmith album . King 's appearance on the track came about because Rick Rubin was producing both bands simultaneously ( Slayer 's Reign in Blood was originally released on Def Jam ) . The full album cover , front to back , features a Boeing 727 -- with `` Beastie Boys '' emblazoned on the tail -- crashing head-on into the side of a mountain . The tail of the plane has the Def Jam logo and the legend ' 3MTA3 ' which spells ` EATME ' when viewed in a mirror . The original title for this album was Do n't Be a Faggot but Columbia Records flatly refused to release the album with this title and pressured Russell Simmons ( their manager and label Def Jam head ) into having the Beastie Boys to come up with another name . Adam Horovitz has since apologized for the band 's earlier title . Music videos were made for the songs '' ( You Gotta ) Fight for Your Right ( to Party ! ) '' , `` No Sleep till Brooklyn '' , `` Hold It , Now Hit It '' , `` Rhymin ' and Stealin ' '' and `` She 's Crafty '' . CBS\/Fox Video released a video album of the five Licensed to Ill videos , plus `` She 's On It '' in 1987 to capitalize on the album 's success . A laserdisc version was also released in Japan . All versions of the CBS\/Fox release are currently out of print due to the rights to the album passing from Columbia and Sony Music to Universal Music Group , and also because of the acrimonious nature of the band 's departure from Def Jam Records . Until the 2005 release of the CD\/DVD Solid Gold Hits , none of the Def Jam-era videos had been included on any subsequent Beastie Boys video compilations . The Solid Gold Hits DVD includes the videos for `` Fight for Your Right '' and `` No Sleep Till Brooklyn '' , as well as a live version of `` Brass Monkey '' from a 2004 concert . In 1998 , the album was selected as one of The Source 's 100 Best Rap Albums . It is still the only album by a white hip-hop act to receive the coveted 5 mics from The Source . In 2003 , the album was ranked number 217 on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . Vibe ( 12\/99 , p. 158 ) - Included in Vibe 's 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century . Q magazine ( 9\/94 , p. 123 ) - 4 Stars - `` Licensed to Ill remains the world 's only punk rock rap album , arguably superior to Never Mind the Bollocks ... knowing that apathy and slovenliness were just around the corner . '' Melody Maker ( 7/22/95 , p. 35 ) - Bloody Essential - `` There 's lots of self-reverential bragging , more tenuous rhymes than are usually permitted by law and , most importantly of all , an unshakably glorious celebration of being alive ... A surprisingly enduring classic . '' In 2006 , Q magazine placed the album at # 16 in its list of `` 40 Best Albums of the '80s '' . In the booklet included with the Beastie Boys ' anthology set The Sounds of Science , Adam Yauch ( MCA ) noted that `` Slow and Low '' was first recorded by Run-D.M.C. in the sessions for their second album , King of Rock , but was ultimately left off the original release ( though the demo version later appeared on the album 's 2005 Deluxe Edition re-release ) . Being one of the Beasties ' favorite songs from the sessions , they got Run-D.M.C. 's permission to record a cover version . Yauch states that only two lines were changed for the Beastie Boys ' version : `` D sees real well 'cause he has four eyes '' was replaced with `` White Castle fries only come in one size '' , and a line stating Run-D.M.C. 's name was changed to `` We 're the Beastie Boys , not Cheech and Chong '' . The notes for The Sounds of Science expand the writing credits to `` Beastie Boys\/J . Simmons\/D . McDaniels\/R . Rubin\/D . Hayden '' , a credit corroborated by ASCAP 's database .
South Tarawa ( in Gilbertese and English : Teinainano Urban Council or TUC ) is the official capital of the Republic of Kiribati on Tarawa Atoll . The meaning of Teinainano is `` down of the mast '' , alluding to the sail-shape of the atoll . The South Tarawa population center consists of all the small islets between Bairiki ( on the west ) to Temaiku\/Bonriki on the east . All of several once separate islets are joined by causeways , forming one long islet on the reef along the southern side of the Tarawa Lagoon . There is also a relatively new causeway -- the Japanese Causeway -- that links South Tarawa to Betio , out of South Tarawa . There is a Kiribati Teacher College and a University of the South Pacific campus on South Tarawa . Bairiki is sometimes considered the capital of Kiribati because at one time both the Parliament and the Presidency ( and main administrative offices ) were located there . The Parliament meets on Ambo islet ; various ministries are scattered between South Tarawa , Betio and Christmas Island ( ministry of the Line and Phoenix islands ) . The Roman Catholic diocese and the Kiribati Protestant Church ( Congregational ) are situated on South Tarawa . Bairiki ( executive ) , Ambo ( legislative ) , Betio ( judicial ) are the main political centres of the capital . Bairiki is a village and an islet now part of South Tarawa , and at one time itself the center of government ( and therefore , capital ) of Kiribati . One of three post offices on Tarawa is located at Bairiki . Bairiki Islet is the most southern islet on the atoll of Tarawa . About nine islets ( of some 23 others on Tarawa ) are larger than Bairiki . Bairiki includes the main administrative center of the Republic of Kiribati ( presidency and most of the ministries ) , but the Parliament has since moved to Ambo , halfway between Bairiki and Bonriki . In the village there is a small port ( the main port for Tarawa is on Betio Islet ) and near Bairiki is a campus belonging to the University of the South Pacific .
Toul is a commune in the Meurthe-et-Moselle department in north-eastern France . It is a sub-prefecture of the department . Toul is located between Commercy and Nancy , and situated between the Moselle River and the Canal de la Marne au Rhin . Toul was known to the Romans as Tullum Leucorum , and was the capital of the Gaulish tribe of the Leuci . In 612 , King Theudebert II of Austrasia was defeated by King Theuderic II of Burgundy near Toul . By the Treaty of Meerssen of 870 , Toul became part of East Francia , the later Holy Roman Empire . During the High Middle Ages , it became a Free Imperial City . Toul was annexed to France by King Henry II in 1552 ; this was recognized by the Holy Roman Empire in the Peace of Westphalia of 1648 . It then was a part of the French province of the Three Bishoprics . During the siege of 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War , the last time that Toul 's defenses were used as a classical fortress , 64 guns opened fire at 6am on 23 September , and the fortress surrendered at 3pm after 2,433 shells had been fired . Toul was the seat of the bishops of Toul ; the diocese was founded around 365 and existed until 1807 . The city was also the primary base of the United States Air Service - predecessor to the United States Air Force - during World War I. As such , it was a base for many of the 45 war time squadrons including the squadrons of the 1st Pursuit Group , 1st Observation Group and others . The Americans referred to the area around Toul as the Toul Sector . Two large operations were launched from this area : the St. Mihiel offensive and the Meuse-Argonne offensive , both in September . The most striking features are the impressive stone ramparts . It is not known precisely when they were first built , but there appears to have been a fortified town at this location since the earliest recorded history . Today , the ramparts encircle and define the old town . They are built of dressed white stone , and topped with grass , and in places are over five metres high . There is a great deal of Roman archÃ ology in the area and allegedly some in the town . The Roman fortified town of Grand is some 30 km away , with its great amphitheatre and temple to the Cult of Apollo . The old town 's architecture is dominated by past glories in various states of decay , including a major gothic cathedral , which is in a poor condition and is being slowly restored . Many of the houses were built as canonical residences in the Late Middle Ages and bear vestiges in the form of ornamental stonework . There is no trace of the monastery , however its wine-cellars still exist , under the shops on the North side of the Rue Gambetta . ( Access is possible via the Camera Shop ) . Toul is at the intersection of the Moselle River ( which divides into the river proper and the Moselle CanalisÃ e just outside the town ) with the Canal de la Marne au Rhin , and was once , consequently , an important port . The barges known as pÃ niches still navigate these watercourses commercially , typically carrying steel , though in the summer much more of the water traffic is for pleasure . There is a main-line railway station at Toul , the last major station before the ( once vast , and still very large ) marshalling yards at Nancy . However , the Paris-Strasbourg TGV line , now under construction , will pass about 20 km north of Toul , approximately mid-way between Metz and Nancy . Its completion will likely reduce Toul 's importance as a station . The surrounding countryside is a wine-growing region , in which the AOC CÃ tes de Toul vintage is produced . Particularly notable is the Gris de Toul . Toul is the seat of two cantons : Toul-Nord with a population of 27,102 , and Toul-Sud with a population of 13,215 . The following table shows the communes in each canton : La place forte de Toul 1870 - 1915 http://fortiffsere.fr/toul/

The holotype is preserved in much the same roosting position as another troodontid fossil , that of Mei long , with its snout tucked under its left hand . Shuvuuia is a genus of bird-like theropod dinosaur from the late Cretaceous period of Mongolia . It is a member of the family Alvarezsauridae , small coelurosaurian dinosaurs which are characterized by short but powerful forelimbs specialized for digging . The type ( and only known ) species is Shuvuuia deserti , or `` desert bird '' . The name Shuvuuia is derived from the Mongolian word shuvuu ( Ñ Ñ Ð Ñ Ñ ) meaning `` bird '' . Shuvuuia was a small and lightly built animal . At 60 cm ( 2 ft ) in length it is one of the smallest known dinosaurs . The skull is lightly built with long and slender jaws and minute teeth . Shuvuuia is unique among non-avian theropods in the skull 's ability to perform prokinesis , that is , it could flex its upper jaw independently of its braincase . The hindlimbs of Shuvuuia were long , slender , and short-toed , which may indicate significant running capabilities . The forelimbs , however , were unusually short and powerfully constructed . Although originally Shuvuuia and other alvarezsaurids were thought to have only a single digit on the front limb , newer specimens show the presence of reduced second and third fingers in addition to the massively enlarged thumb known from previous specimens . Like other alverezsaurids , Shuvuuia may have used its forelimbs to open insect nests , and its slender , unusually mobile jaws to probe after such prey . Fossils of Shuvuuia are currently known from two locations within the Djadochta Formation : Ukhaa Tolgod and TÃ grÃ giin Shiree . These sites are thought to be about 75 million years old ( late Campanian age ) . Contemporary genera included Velociraptor and Protoceratops . Shuvuuia was the fourth non-avian dinosaur genus that demonstrated direct evidence of feathers . The type specimen was found surrounded by small , hollow , tube-like structures resembling the rachis ( central vane ) of modern bird feathers . Though highly deteriorated and poorly preserved , biochemical analyses later showed that these structures contain decay products of the protein beta-keratin , and more significantly , the absence of alpha-keratin . While beta-keratin is found in all integumentary ( skin and feather ) cells of reptiles and birds , only bird feathers completely lack alpha-keratin . These findings show that , though poorly preserved , Shuvuuia likely possessed a coat of feathers .
Selby Abbey is an Anglican parish church in the town of Selby , North Yorkshire . It is one of the relatively few surviving abbey churches of the medieval period , and , although not a cathedral , is one of the biggest . It was founded by Benedict of Auxerre in 1069 and subsequently built by the de Lacy family . Like York Minster , the church rests on a base of sand and has suffered from subsidence . Many sections collapsed entirely during the 17th century , and further serious damage was done by a fire of 1906 which melted the bells in the central tower . Nevertheless , extensive rebuilding and refurbishment has made the church one of the most impressive in the country . The tower is Norman , but the eastern end is in Decorated Gothic style , and the west front a mixture of Norman , Gothic and Victorian . The interior bears some similarity to that of Durham Cathedral , on which the design was modelled . Richly-carved and moulded capitals are found throughout the church . A major feature is the east window , which contains original medieval glass and depicts the Tree of Jesse , a popular subject of that period . The chancel stonework is thought to have been designed by Henry Yevele . A notable feature of the abbey is the 14th century Washington Window , featuring the heraldic arms of the ancestors of George Washington , the first president of the United States . The design featuring three red stars above two red bands on a white shield is said to have been the model for the US flag , and is the model for the flag of the District of Columbia . The Abbey is currently undergoing an extensive restoration , costing several million pounds . Stage 6 , the restoration of the Scriptorium was completed at a cost of Â # 795,000 . The Â # 400,000 cost of restoring the South Choir Aisle and the ` Washington Window ' was met in full by British American Tobacco . A new organ was built by John Compton in 1906 but was soon afterwards destroyed by the fire . A new organ was built by William Hill dating from 1909 , with restorations by Hill , Norman and Beard in 1950 and John T Jackson in 1975 . The Bishop of Selby is a Suffragan Bishop to the Archbishop of York and is head of the Archdeaconry of York . Selby Abbey is one of twenty members of the Greater Churches Group .
Tuas is largely an industrial zone located in the western part of Singapore . The Tuas Planning Area is located within the West Region , and is bounded by Tengeh Reservoir to the north , Strait of Johor to the west , Straits of Singapore to the south , and the Pan Island Expressway to the east . The Malaysia-Singapore Second Link that links Singapore and Malaysia is located at Tuas . Tuas is derived from a daytime fishing method uncommon these days . The coastal Malays floated coconut fronds and leafy branches kept close together by the rising tide . A large net was then spread and suspended below . The shade provided drew in the fish . More and more were attracted until , at a given signal , the net was hauled up by the Malay fishermen in the boats . Levering or hauling up is menuas , which became tuas . Tuas also means `` to chop in two pieces '' , `` to raise by leverage '' , and `` to support '' . In physics lesson , Tuas means lever . For more information , see simple machine . The Tuas area in the early nineteenth century was referred to by three place names : Tg Kampong , Tg Rawa and Tg Gull â '' references made in Franklin and Jackson 's 1830 map of Singapore . Tuas used to be swamp land which was later cleared for squatter settlement . It became a fishing village . In the old days , it was not unusual to see about 200 fishing boats in Tuas every morning . In the 1970s , the residents in Tuas were resettled in public housing estates . Tuas was then developed for industrial use . In the 1980s , land was reclaimed around Tuas for more industrial development . By 1988 , about 6.5 kmÂ of land off Tuas were reclaimed . Land reclamation off Tuas is still ongoing ; the land area of Tuas will increase from 17.02 kmÂ in 1996 to the projected 20.75 kmÂ by 2010 . ã PentaOcean Construction ( ä '' æ å '' è ï 1\/4 is most heavily involved in the land reclamation . ã The peninsular reclaimed in the late 1980s to early 1990s is named Tuas South , while the land currently being reclaimed to the southeast of Tuas Jetty is known as the Tuas South Extension . Being far away from the main residential areas and the commercial district of Singapore , Tuas was chosen as a site for industrial development as the adjacent industrial areas in Jurong were being built . Heavy industries can be found in Tuas , although not as much as on Jurong Island . Two of Singapore 's four incinerators are also found in Tuas , namely Tuas Incinerator and Tuas South Incinerator . A world-scale renewable diesel plant , using palm oil as feedstock , is due to be completed in 2010 . Its capacity will make it the largest plant of its kind ( 800,000 tons per annum ) . Further reclaimation into the Tuas South extension is done to house the world largest storage of oil . Tuas has a number of residential buildings provided at low cost for the people who work there . Some are located at Benoi Sector , which also has an eating place , whilst the others are located at Pioneer Road . The low rise flats are normally named from Blocks A to H , and are usually 9 to 11 stories high . They are not elegant , being built to meet basic residential requirements ; they provide shelter with an electricity and water supply . In recent years , land reclaimation has taken place in Tuas South to house the oil storage tunnel . All bus routes that go to Tuas are from Boon Lay Bus Interchange and operated by SBS Transit . Service 182 will call at Tuas Checkpoint during certain period daily and this service will operate as Service 182M after 2130 daily .

Mayors ( German title : OberbÃ 1\/4 rgermeister ) of East Berlin , capital in the socialist state of German Democratic Republic . The Mayor of Berlin ( Regierender BÃ 1\/4 rgermeister von Berlin ) was democratically elected in January 1991 . Governing Mayors ( German title : Regierender BÃ 1\/4 rgermeister von Berlin ) of West Berlin ( 1949 â `` 90 ) , and Berlin , capital of Germany since 1990 .
East Berlin was the name given to the eastern part of Berlin between 1949 and 1990 . It consisted of the Soviet sector of Berlin that was established in 1945 . The American , British and French sectors became West Berlin , a part strongly associated with West Germany but a free city . Despite its status as part of an occupied city , East Berlin was claimed as the capital of East Germany , as the Soviets did not honor the distinction of a free city for their sector . From 13 August 1961 until 9 November 1989 East Berlin was separated from West Berlin by the Berlin Wall . The East German government referred to East Berlin simply as `` Berlin '' or often `` Berlin , Hauptstadt der DDR '' ( Berlin , capital of the GDR ) . The term `` Democratic Sector '' was also used until the 1960s . ( See also Naming conventions ) . The Western Allies ( the USA , Britain and France ) never formally acknowledged the authority of the East German government to govern East Berlin ; the official Allied protocol recognized only the authority of the Soviet Union in East Berlin in accordance with the occupation status of Berlin as a whole . The United States Command Berlin , for example , published detailed instructions for U.S. military and civilian personnel wishing to visit East Berlin . In fact , the three Western commandants regularly protested the presence of the East German National People 's Army ( NVA ) in East Berlin , particularly on the occasion of military parades . Nevertheless , the three Western Allies eventually established embassies in East Berlin in the 1970s , although they never recognized it as the capital of East Germany . Treaties instead used terms such as `` seat of government . '' On 3 October 1990 , West and East Germany were reunited , thus formally ending the existence of East Berlin . Since reunification , the German government has spent vast amounts of money on reintegrating the two halves of the city and bringing services and infrastructure in the former East Berlin up to the standard established in West Berlin . Despite this , there are still obvious differences between eastern and western Berlin . Eastern Berlin has a distinctly different visual aspect , partly because of the greater survival of prewar faÃ ades and streetscapes , some still showing signs of wartime damage , and partly because of the distinctive style of urban Stalinist architecture used in the GDR . As in other former East German cities , a small number of GDR-era names commemorating socialist heroes have been preserved , such as Karl-Marx-Allee , Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz and Karl-Liebknecht-Stra Ã e ; this followed a long process of review in which many such street names were deemed inappropriate and were changed . Still visible throughout former East Berlin are the characteristic `` AmpelmÃ nnchen '' on some pedestrian traffic lights . These days they are also visible in parts of the former West Berlin following a civic debate about whether the `` AmpelmÃ nnchen '' should be abolished or disseminated more widely .
Rock of Ages Corporation is a granite quarrying and finishing company located in Graniteville , Vermont . It was founded in 1885 . The company was one of the cemetery-related businesses profiled in the 2005 PBS documentary A Cemetery Special . The company employs around 230 people , and the company made a profit of around $ 800,000 in 2009 on revenues of $ 21.6 million , up from a loss of more than $ 2 million in 2008 . On 19 October 2010 , Swenson Granite , based in Concord , New Hampshire , announced that it and Rock of Ages had agreed to merge . Swenson paid Rock of Ages shareholders a total of $ 39 million . ROAC maintains the world 's largest `` deep hole '' granite quarry . The quarry is called the `` E. L. Smith Quarry '' , and the Devonian Barre Granite is mined there . The extravagant quarry is among some of the oldest types of rock on earth , coming from the inner core of the earth and slowly rising towards the earth 's crust . Once granite reaches the ground 's surface and the soft upper layers of dirt and gravel have worn away , the granite then reveals itself . Granite was originally quarried using primitive techniques which implemented hand saws and explosive charges to blast away the `` benches '' of the quarry . Modern techniques have evolved to include diamond-tipped wire saws and water jets . The White Granite extracted from this quarry is the highest quality granite in the world . Visitors to the Rock of Ages factory and gift shop can also watch quarriers in the quarry cutting the granite away from the quarry wall .

Hypsilophodon ( ; meaning ` high-crested tooth ' ) is an ornithopod dinosaur genus from the Early Cretaceous period of Europe . It was a small bipedal animal with an herbivorous or possibly omnivorous diet . Abundant fossil remains found in England indicate that Hypsilophodon reached about 2 m in length . The first remains of Hypsilophodon were recovered in the early days of paleontology in 1849 . However , at the time , the bones were thought to belong to a young Iguanodon . It was not until 1870 that paleontologist T. H. Huxley was able to publish a full description of Hypsilophodon as we know it today . He had been provided with a number of skeletons by the Reverend William Fox , after whom the first species of Hypsilophodon was named . Early paleontologists modeled the body of this small , bipedal , herbivorous dinosaur in various ways . In 1882 some paleontologists suggested that , like a modern tree-kangaroo , Hypsilophodon was able to climb trees in order to seek shelter . This was the accepted view for almost a century . However , Peter M. Galton finally performed more accurate analysis of the musculo-skeletal structure in 1974 and convinced most paleontologists that Hypsilophodon remained firmly on the ground . Since then , three near-complete and over twenty minor finds have been made , especially on the Isle of Wight , off the south coast of England . Other finds have been made in southern England and Portugal . Another misconception concerning the anatomy of Hypsilophodon was that it was armored . The putative armor , consisting of thin mineralized plates from the torso , instead appear to be examples of intercostal plates associated with the rib cage . Such plates are better known from Talenkauen and Thescelosaurus , and were probably cartilaginous in origin . There is only one known species of Hypsilophodon , Huxley 's original H. foxii . Galton and Jensen named another species in 1979 , H. wielandi , which is based on a thigh bone from South Dakota , USA , but it is now regarded as an indeterminate basal ornithopod . Hypsilophodon was a relatively small dinosaur . While not quite so small as , for example , Compsognathus , Hypsilophodon was only around 2.3 metres in length . It would have reached approximately waist-height on a modern man and would have weighed about the same , at 50 t. Like most small dinosaurs , Hypsilophodon was bipedal and ran on two legs . Its entire body was built for running ; a light-weight , minimized skeleton , low , aerodynamic posture , long legs and stiff tail for balance all would have allowed it to travel remarkably fast for its size . Due to its small size , Hypsilophodon fed on low-growing vegetation , most likely preferring young shoots and roots in the manner of modern deer . The structure of its skull , with the teeth set far back into the jaw , strongly suggests that it had cheeks , an advanced feature that would have facilitated the chewing of food . There were twenty-eight to thirty ridged teeth in the animal 's jaw which , due to their alternate arrangement , appear to have been self-sharpening . As in almost all dinosaurs and certainly all the ornithischians , the teeth were continuously replaced . The level of parental care in this dinosaur has not been defined , although a neatly-arranged nest has been found , suggesting that some care was taken before hatching . Fossils of large groups have been found , so it is likely that the animals moved in herds . For these reasons , the hypsilophodonts , particularly Hypsilophodon , have often been referred to as the `` deer of the Mesozoic '' . Despite living in the last of the periods in which dinosaurs walked the earth , the Cretaceous , Hypsilophodon had a number of primitive features . For example , there were five digits on each ` hand ' and four on each foot . Most dinosaurs had lost these redundant features by the Cretaceous period . Also , although it had a beak like most ornithischians , Hypsilophodon still had pointed triangular teeth in the front of the jaw . Most herbivorous dinosaurs had , by this stage , become sufficiently specialized that the front teeth had been altogether lost ( although there is some debate as to whether these teeth may have had a specialized function in Hypsilophodon ) . The group Hypsilophodontidae remained remarkably static from the late Jurassic to the end of the Cretaceous . It is possible that this was because the animals were almost perfectly adapted to their lifestyle , therefore selective pressure , it is assumed , was low .
Radebeul is a town ( groÃ e Kreisstadt ) in the Elbe valley in the district of MeiÃ en in Saxony , Germany , a suburb of Dresden . It is well-known for its viticulture , a museum dedicated to writer Karl May and a narrow gauge railway connecting Radebeul with the castle of Moritzburg and the town of Radeburg . The MeiÃ en area , where Radebeul is located , is one of the northeasternmost areas where wine is grown today . It is sometimes called `` Saxon Nice '' for its pleasant landscape and mild climate . A village Radebeul was first mentioned in 1349 . In 1905 it absorbed the neighboring village of Serkowitz . On April 1 , 1924 Radebeul became a town . Meanwhile , the neighboring village of KÃ tzschenbroda had taken over Lindenau in 1920 and Naundorf , Zitzschewig und NiederlÃ Ã nitz by 1924 , when it was made a town as well . In 1934 Wahnsdorf and OberlÃ Ã nitz joined Radebeul , and on January 1 , 1935 the towns of KÃ tzschenbroda and Radebeul were united under the name of Radebeul ( `` KÃ tzschenbroda '' having a slavic root , this name was considered too `` ungermanic '' at the time ) . In 1947 Radebeul was made part of the district of Dresden . In 1995 it received the status of a major town inside the rural district ( groÃ e Kreisstadt ) ; when the rural district of Dresden ( Dresden-Land ) was dissolved , Radebeul became part of the district of MeiÃ en . The town can be reached by Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe tram route 4 or by Dresden S-Bahn line S1 , which serves four stations in Radebeul . Deutsche Bahn regional trains 18 and 50 also stop at Radebeul Ost station . Radebeul Ost is also the terminus of the historic Radebeulâ `` Radeburg narrow-gauge steam railway and the station closest to the Karl May Museum . Radebeul has been renowned for its vineyards since 1324 . It lies on the Saxon Wine Road .
The flag of Greenland was designed by Greenland native Thue Christiansen . It features two equal horizontal bands of white ( top ) and red with a large disk slightly to the hoist side of center . The top half of the disk is red , the bottom half is white . The entire flag measures 12 by 18 parts ; each stripe measures 6 parts ; the disk is 8 parts in diameter , horizontally offset by 7 parts from the hoist to the center of the circle , and vertically centered . Its local name in the Greenlandic language is Erfalasorput , which means `` our flag '' , but Aappalaartoq ( meaning `` the red '' ) is also used for both the Greenlandic flag and the Dannebrog . Today Greenlanders display both the Erfalasorput and the Dannebrog , often side-by-side . It is also the only Nordic flag without a Nordic Cross . Greenland first entertained the idea of a flag of its own in 1973 when five Greenlanders proposed a green , white and blue flag . The following year , a newspaper solicited eleven design proposals ( all but one of which was a Nordic cross ) and polled the people to determine the most popular . The Dannebrog was better liked than any . Little came of this effort . In 1978 , Denmark granted home rule to Greenland , making it an equal member of the RigsfÃ llesskab . The home rule government held an official call for flag proposals , receiving 555 ( of which 293 were submitted by Greenlanders ) . The deciding committee came to no consensus , so more proposals were solicited . Finally the present red-and-white design by Christiansen narrowly won over a green-and-white Nordic cross by a vote of fourteen to eleven . Christiansen 's red-and-white flag was officially adopted June 21 , 1985 . To honor the tenth anniversary of the Erfalasorput , the Greenland Post Office issued commemorative stamps and a leaflet by its creator . He described the white stripe as representing the glaciers and ice cap , which cover more than 80 % of the island ; the red stripe , the ocean ; the red semicircle , the sun , with its bottom part sunk in the ocean ; and the white semicircle , the icebergs and pack ice . The design is also reminiscent of the setting sun half-submerged below the horizon and reflected on the sea . The colors of the flag are the same as those of the Dannebrog , symbolising Greenland 's place in the Danish Realm .

Zingiberaceae , or the Ginger family , is a family of flowering plants consisting of aromatic perennial herbs with creeping horizontal or tuberous rhizomes , comprising ca . 52 genera and more than 1300 species , distributed throughout tropical Africa , Asia , and the Americas . Many species are important ornamental plants , spices , or medicinal plants . Ornamental genera include the shell gingers ( Alpinia ) , Siam or summer tulip ( Curcuma alismatifolia ) , Globba , ginger lily ( Hedychium ) , Kaempferia , torch-ginger Nicolaia , Renealmia , and ginger ( Zingiber ) . Spices include ginger ( Zingiber ) , galangal or Thai ginger ( Alpinia galanga and others ) , melegueta pepper ( Aframomum melegueta ) , myoga ( Zingiber mioga ) , turmeric ( Curcuma ) , cardamom ( Amomum , Elettaria ) . Members of the family are small to large herbaceous plants with distichous leaves with basal sheaths that overlap to form a pseudostem . The plants are either self-supporting or epiphytic . Flowers are hermaphroditic , usually strongly zygomorphic , in determinate cymose inflorescences , and subtended by conspicuous , spirally arranged bracts . The perianth is composed of two whorls , a fused tubular calyx , and a tubular corolla with one lobe larger than the other two . Flowers typically have two of their stamenoids ( sterile stamens ) fused to form a petaloid lip , and have only one fertile stamen . The ovary is inferior and topped by two nectaries , the stigma is funnel-shaped . Some genera yield essential oils used in the perfume industry ( Alpinia , Hedychium ) . The Zingiberaceae have a pantropical distributionâ '' found in the tropics of Africa , Asia and the Americas , with its greatest diversity in Southeast Asia .
The Brak Show is an animated television series that aired on Cartoon Network 's late night programing block , Adult Swim . The Brak Show is a spin-off of the animated television series , Space Ghost Coast to Coast , and featured recurring characters from Space Ghost Coast to Coast and Cartoon Planet . Both programs used stock footage from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon Space Ghost . The protagonist is Brak , voiced by Andy Merrill , who developed a quirky persona for the character . The Brak Show premiered on December 21 , 2000 , and ended on December 31 , 2003 , with a total of twenty-eight episodes . An extra webisode debuted on Adult Swim Video on May 24 , 2007 . The first fourteen episodes were released on DVD on February 1 , 2005 , and the remaining episodes were released on August 8 , 2006 . The webisode is not currently available on DVD . The Brak Show was preceded by two specials , both entitled Brak Presents The Brak Show Starring Brak . Despite the similarities in the titles , the two Brak Shows have very little in common . The former show was a spoof of early sitcoms , while the latter parodied the genre of variety shows . Both of the episodes aired in the US only once in February and March 2000 , although clips of the show could be viewed after the Space Ghost Coast to Coast time slot on occasion . In the UK only one of the two specials aired on Bravo on August 23 , 2006 and then again on December 23 , 2007 . There are also clips from the shows on The Brak Show Volume 1 DVD and Adult Swim Video . The Brak Show series premiered unannounced in the early hours of December 21 , 2000 , along with the `` Radio Free Sealab '' episode of Sealab 2021 . This `` stealth '' pilot ( titled `` Leave it to Brak '' ) featured hand-drawn backgrounds and different opening titles . The show 's second showing was on Adult Swim 's debut on September 2 , 2001 . As with most of the first original Adult Swim shows it was produced by Williams Street Studios . The show is about Brak 's suburban life with his alien mother and Cuban father . It originally started off as a parody of situation comedies , but just like its sister show , Aqua Teen Hunger Force , the plot dissolved over time and became increasingly bizarre . The setting is suburbia with an extra-planetary hint . A Saturn-like planet appears in the background on occasion , and many of the extras are aliens . Oftentimes , episodes are written doing a parody of stereotypical episodes on regular sitcoms ( e.g. . The son showing an interest in women , the Dad being reconnected with an old passion , the Mother temporarily leaving after a fight , etc. ) . The show was canceled in December 2003 . However , Adult Swim announced in a bump on October 22 , 2006 that , The Brak Show would return to production as an internet cartoon on the network 's website . On May 24 , 2007 , a single webisode premiered online No further webisodes have been released . On August 1 , 2008 , Adult Swim had a retro night , a marathon of original Adult Swim shows from their 2001 and 2002 era , The Brak Show was featured on that marathon . In addition to being available on DVD , episodes 1-29 of The Brak Show , including the original version of `` Mr. Bawk Ba Gawk '' , are available on the `` Build Your Own DVD '' feature on Adultswim.com . The Brak Show is currently not available on iTunes .
Silversun Pickups is an alternative rock band from Los Angeles , California , formed in 2002 . The band comprises lead vocalist and guitarist Brian Aubert , vocalist and bassist Nikki Monninger , drummer Christopher Guanlao and keyboardist Joe Lester . The band released their debut EP , Pikul , in July 2005 , and their debut full-length album , Carnavas , on July 26 , 2006 . Their second full length album , Swoon , was released on April 14 , 2009 . The band members are friends who had played together previously or in mutual friends ' bands . They got their start in many of the most important L.A. clubs , most often at Silverlake Lounge or nearby Spaceland , and began to draw a strong following upon the release of the Pikul EP . The band originated in L.A. 's Silver Lake music scene , home of Rilo Kiley and others . The band was originally called A Couple of Couples . Their current name comes from an off licence across from the Silverlake Lounge and near their house at Sunset and Silverlake Blvds in Los Angeles . In interviews , however , the band often say their name is more of `` a state of mind , '' supposedly from living so close to everything an L.A.-based indie rock band would need late at night . For Pikul , fellow Silverlaker Tanya Haden was enlisted to play cello . Pikul has sold 55,000 copies to date . On September 26 , 2006 , the band released their debut full-length album Carnavas . Two of the album 's four singles , `` Lazy Eye '' and `` Well Thought Out Twinkles , '' would hit the top 10 of the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in 2007 . The band finished a three-week tour opening for Australian rockers Wolfmother on December 9 , 2006 , and later toured with OK Go and Snow Patrol on their U.S. spring tour , which ended on April 10 , 2007 . The band also played at the Coachella Music Festival in Indio , California on April 27 , 2007 and would play various concerts for Modern Rock formatted radio stations in the US throughout the year . The band also toured the UK and Ireland while Carnavas was released there on May 28 , 2007 . They opened for Foo Fighters in Edinburgh , Scotland , and Dublin , Ireland . They also opened for the Kaiser Chiefs during their European tour . Carnavas peaked at # 80 on the Billboard 200 , and has sold 410,000 copies since its release . It was announced through Alternative Press Magazine Issue # 243 that the band 's second album would be titled Swoon . It includes 10 tracks and , instead of having a straightforward mid-tempo sound , `` Some songs are very quiet and delicate , ( while ) others are just fucking loud . '' ( Brian Aubert ) The album was released on April 14 , 2009 to positive reviews . It debuted at # 7 selling approximately 43,000 copies in its first week . Swoon has sold 285,000 copies so far . The first single released was `` Panic Switch '' , which quickly aired in heavy rotation on VH1 and MTV music video shows . The song also received worldwide rotation on the radio airwaves . Silversun Pickups was confirmed to play the 2009 Voodoo Music Experience Festival over the Halloween weekend . In 2009 , the band performed `` Catch and Release '' , `` Panic Switch '' , `` Lazy Eye '' , `` Well Thought Out Twinkles '' , `` Growing Old is Getting Old '' , and `` Kissing Families '' for MTV Unplugged . In early December 2009 , the band was nominated in the Best New Artist category for the 52nd Grammy Awards . Their nomination drew some controversy , because the band was already moderately successful before the 2008-2009 nominating year , although this was mainly due to misunderstandings involving the selections of Best New Artist nominees . However , they lost to the Zac Brown Band . They supported Placebo on their Winter 2009 European tour . Upon release of Swoon , they toured with Manchester Orchestra as main support . Also , in spring 2010 the band toured with Muse for their extensive US tour . They toured North America again in summer 2010 with Against Me ! and The Henry Clay People . . They toured with Australian rock band Birds of Tokyo in September 2010 and ended an 18 month tour in support of Swoon at Austin City Limits . They are now on a break and will start working on their third album in 2011 . The band 's sound , often encompassing multiple overdubs of distorted guitars , is frequently compared to that of The Smashing Pumpkins , while the band members have said they are heavily influenced by artists such as My Bloody Valentine , Pixies , The Velvet Underground , Elliott Smith , Sonic Youth , Sweet , Modest Mouse , Sunny Day Real Estate and Secret Machines as well as numerous other artists with lesser publicity .

The strange quark or s quark ( from its symbol , s ) is the third-lightest of all quarks , a type of elementary particle , and a major constituent of matter . Strange quarks are found in hadrons , which are subatomic particles . Example of hadrons containing strange quarks include kaons , strange D mesons , Sigma baryons , and other strange particles . The strange quark was sometimes called the sideways quark in the past . It , along with the charm quark is part of the second generation of matter , and has an electric charge of â ' e and a bare mass of . Like all quarks , the strange quark is an elementary fermion with spin - ( ( spin-1 \/ 2 ) ) , and experiences all four fundamental interactions : gravitation , electromagnetism , weak interactions , and strong interactions . The antiparticle of the strange quark is the strange antiquark ( sometimes called antistrange quark or simply antistrange ) , which differs from it only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign . The first strange particle ( a particle containing a strange quark ) was discovered in 1947 ( kaons ) , but the existence of the strange quark itself ( and that of the up and down quarks ) was only postulated in 1964 by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig to explain the Eightfold Way classification scheme of hadrons . The first evidence for the existence of quarks came in 1968 , in deep inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center . These experiments confirmed the existence of up and down quarks , and by extension , strange quarks , as they were required to explain the Eightfold Way . In the beginnings of particle physics ( first half of the 20th century ) , hadrons such as protons , neutron and pions were thought to be elementary particles . However , new hadrons were discovered , the ` particle zoo ' grew from a few particles in the early 1930s and 1940s to several dozens of them in the 1950s . However some particles were much longer lived than others ; most particles decayed through the strong interaction and had lifetimes of around 10 â 23 seconds . But when they decayed through the weak interactions , they had lifetimes of around 10 â 10 seconds to decay . While studying these decay Murray Gell-Mann ( in 1953 ) and Kazuhiko Nishijima ( in 1955 ) developed the concept of strangeness ( which Nishijima called eta-charge , after the eta meson ) which explained the ` strangeness ' of the longer-lived particles . The Gell-Mann â `` Nishijima formula is the result of these efforts to understand strange decays . However , the relationships between each particles and the physical basis behind the strangeness property was still unclear . In 1961 , Gell-Mann and Yuval Ne 'em an ( independently of each other ) proposed a hadron classification scheme called the Eightfold Way , or in more technical terms , SU ( 3 ) flavor symmetry . This ordered hadrons into isospin multiplets . The physical basis behind both isospin and strangeness was only explained in 1964 , when Gell-Mann and George Zweig ( independently of each other ) proposed the quark model , then consisting only of up , down , and strange quarks . Up and down quarks were the carriers of isospin , while the strange quark carried strangeness . While the quark model explained the Eightfold Way , no direct evidence of the existence of quarks was found until 1968 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center . Deep inelastic scattering experiments indicated that protons had substructure , and that protons made of three more-fundamental particles explained the data ( thus confirming the quark model ) . At first people were reluctant to identify the three-bodies as quarks , instead preferring Richard Feynman 's parton description , but over time the quark theory became accepted ( see November Revolution ) .
Robert Remak ( 26 July 1815 â `` 29 August 1865 ) was a Polish\/German embryologist , physiologist , and neurologist , born in Posen , Prussia . Dr. Remak obtained his medical degree from Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin in 1838 specializing in neurology . He is best known for reducing Karl Ernst von Baer 's four germ layers to three : the ectoderm , mesoderm and endoderm . He also discovered unmyelinated nerve fibers and the nerve cells in the heart sometimes called Remak 's ganglia . He studied under Johannes Muller at the University of Berlin . Remak discovered that the origin of cells was by the division of pre-existing cells . Despite his accomplishments , because of his Jewish faith he was repeatedly denied full professor status until late in life , and even then was denied the usual benefits of the position . His son Ernst Julius Remak was also a neurologist and his grandson was the mathematician Robert Remak who died in Auschwitz in 1942 .
Cappielow is a district of Greenock in Inverclyde , west central Scotland . It is home to Scottish First Division side Greenock Morton F.C. . The name Cappielow , taken alone , usually refers to the Cappielow Park stadium , but it can also refer to a small area of housing or the adjoining industrial estate . Cappielow Park is across East Hamilton Street from the River Clyde , by the motorway towards Port Glasgow and Glasgow . The uncovered home terrace behind the goals on the turnstile side runs along Sinclair Street . The ground is approximately five minutes walk from Cartsdyke . Cappielow 's etymology is supposedly of Scandinavian origin , although details of this are sketchy . It has been home to the club since the early part of the 20th century . Refurbishment has recently been completed , and presently the capacity is around 11,000 , with 5,741 of these being seated . The area behind the western goal is known as the Wee Dublin end , which contains non-backed bench seating , converted from the old terracing that once stood there . The main stand contains plastic bucket seating , which replaced the wooden benches that were a fixture of the ground until the late 1990s . The Cowshed lies to the north of the pitch ; formerly a fully terraced area for both home and away supporters ( complete with segregation fence down the middle ) , it is now for home supporters only , with much of the frontal terracing removed , and plastic bucket seats occupying its place . Behind the eastern goal is the `` Sinclair Street '' end , with uncovered terracing . On 12 December 2008 , Morton announced the purchase of a stand from long time rivals St. Mirren , as they were leaving their traditional Love Street home to move to Greenhill Road . It will be re-erected at the `` Wee Dublin end '' . It was also announced two of St. Mirren 's floodlights have been purchased , to be put at either end of the Cowshed . A statement on the Morton official website concludes : `` Despite our rivalry , we have always had a good relationship with St Mirren and we would like to take this opportunity of thanking them publicly for all their assistance and wishing them every success in their new home .

The megabyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information storage or transmission with two different values depending on context : bytes ( 220 ) generally for computer memory ; and one million bytes ( 106 , see prefix mega - ) generally for computer storage . The IEEE Standards Board has decided that `` Mega will mean 1 000 000 '' , with exceptions allowed for the base-two meaning . In rare cases , it is used to mean 1000 1024 bytes . It is commonly abbreviated as Mbyte or MB ( compare Mb , for the megabit ) . The term `` megabyte '' is commonly used to mean either 10002 bytes or 10242 bytes . This originated as compromise technical jargon for the byte multiples that needed to be expressed by the powers of 2 but lacked a convenient name . As 1024 ( 210 ) approximates 1000 ( 103 ) , roughly corresponding SI multiples began to be used for binary multiples . By the end of 2007 , standards and government authorities including IEC , IEEE , EU , and NIST proposed standards for binary prefixes and requiring the use of megabyte to strictly denote 10002 bytes and mebibyte to denote 10242 bytes . This is reflected in an increasing number of software projects using the new definitions , but some file managers still show file sizes using the binary interpretation ( 10242 bytes ) . Semiconductor memory doubles in size for each address line added to an integrated circuit package , which favors counts that are powers of two . The capacity of a disk drive is the product of the sector size , number of sectors per track , number of tracks per side , and the number of disk platters in the drive . Changes in any of these factors would not usually double the size . Sector sizes were set as powers of two ( 256 bytes , 512 bytes and so on ) for convenience in processing . It was a natural extension to give the capacity of a disk drive in multiples of the sector size , giving a mix of decimal and binary multiples when expressing total disk capacity .
Marina Rikhvanova is a Russian ecologist and leader of the Baikal Ecological Wave ( BEW ) organization which protects Siberiaâ s Lake Baikal from ecological damage . Lake Baikal , the worldâ s biggest reservoir of fresh water , is currently under threat from industrial pollution . In 2008 , Rikhvanova was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize . Rikhvanova 's concern for the Lake Baikal dates to her years in college , when she wrote a paper on environmental threats posed by a pulp and a paper mill in Baikalsk that had been dumping contaminants into the lake since the 1960s . The mill dumped thousands of tons of pollutants into the lake , including dioxin , which has appeared in Baikal fish and the fat of Baikal seals . When Rikhvanova co-founded a non-governmental organization called Baikal Ecological Wave in 1990 , she targeted the mill . Rikhvanova organized demonstrations , petitions and meetings , all aimed at bringing an end to the mill 's pollution of Baikal . Last year , Russian authorities ordered the Baikalsk plant to switch to a closed water treatment system that eliminated any wastewater discharge into the lake . In 2006 , Putin decided to reroute an oil pipeline that would have been built within a half-mile of Baikal , near a fault line . This followed protest rallies by thousands of Russians in the streets of Irkutsk . Rikhvanova has paid a price for her advocacy . Russian police have raided her offices and seized her organization 's computers . In 2008 , a group of Russian youths attacked a tent camp Rikhvanova had organized to protest a proposed uranium enrichment center in Angarsk , about 50 miles west of Baikal .

Marilyn Tucker Quayle ( born July 29 , 1949 ) is an American lawyer , novelist , and political figure who is the wife of former U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle and held the unofficial title of Second Lady of the United States from 1989 until 1993 . Marilyn Tucker was born in the Meridian-Kessler area of Indianapolis , Indiana to Mary Alice Craig and Warren S. Tucker . The fourth of six children , Marilyn 's parents were both doctors . She had a strict Christian upbringing . The Tuckers were longtime admirers of Colonel Robert B. Thieme , Jr. , the founder and former pastor of Berachah Church in Houston , who was described in an Associated Press article as `` known for unorthodox biblical interpretations and for verbal attacks on liberals , welfare recipients , homosexuals and others . '' Years later , when media attention focused on her family 's religious beliefs , Marilyn Quayle said in an NBC interview : `` I grew up with my mother listening to ( Thieme 's ) tapes . ... I have never listened to him on social issues . I did n't even know that he espoused any . '' She does defend his biblical teachings . As for her own religion , Marilyn Tucker Quayle is a Presbyterian . Marilyn attended Broad Ripple High School and subsequently received a bachelor 's degree in political science from Purdue University . While attending Purdue , she ran for treasurer of her freshman class . She later attended law school at night and earned a J.D. at Indiana University School of Law - Indianapolis , where she met Dan Quayle , the son of a newspaper publisher . The two sat next to each other in the front row in class . Marilyn frequently spoke up and sought out the professor after class was over . She and Dan Quayle were married 10 weeks later , on November 18 , 1972 . They live in Paradise Valley , Arizona , and have three children : Tucker , founder of an investment company called Tynwald Capital ; Benjamin , a Republican congressman representing Arizona 's 3rd Congressional District ; and Corinne . The Quayles worked as attorneys in Huntington , Indiana at a law practice , Quayle and Quayle . The couple suspended their practice after he was elected to Congress in 1976 . After the family moved to the Washington , D.C. area in 1977 , Marilyn remained actively involved in Dan Quayle 's career . She offered him advice on strategy , clipped relevant articles , and read his paperwork at home . When Dan Quayle was elected Vice President in 1988 , the governor of Indiana Robert Orr offered to appoint Marilyn Quayle to the Senate seat vacated by her husband . She declined , citing a potential conflict of interest with the George H. W. Bush administration . During her husband 's term as Vice President of the United States , Marilyn Quayle served on the board of the Federal Emergency Management Agency , as Chairman of the International Disasters Advisory Committee for the Agency for International Development , and as the National Cancer Institute 's national spokesperson for NCI 's Breast Cancer Summits . She also served on the United States ' special high-level council for the International Decade for Natural Hazard Reduction . She shares her husband 's Republican opposition to abortion and the ERA . Her Secret Service codename was , or is , `` Sunshine '' . In a speech before the 1992 Republican National Convention , Quayle dismissed Bill Clinton 's claim to a new generation of leadership , saying , `` Not everyone demonstrated , dropped out , took drugs , joined in the sexual revolution or dodged the draft . '' In the 1990s , Marilyn Quayle authored or co-authored several books , including two works of thriller fiction written with her sister , Nancy Tucker Northcott . The novels ( Embrace The Serpent and The Campaign ) follow a fictional black evangelical Republican senator who becomes the victim of a liberal-media smear campaign and an unnamed Democratic president of questionable morality . The senator eventually clears his name and the novels conclude with the suicide of the Democratic president . She also wrote Moments that Matter with her husband . Marilyn Quayle served as a strong force behind her husband 's bid in the United States presidential election , 2000 . His campaign ended early , prior to any primary voting , after establishment Republican backing aligned behind George W. Bush . Actively involved in a number of charitable causes , Marilyn Quayle has placed a special emphasis on disaster preparedness and breast cancer research . Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 56 . Quayle is currently a partner in the law firm of Krieg , DeVault , Alexander & Capehart , where she practices general corporate law with an emphasis on mergers and acquisitions , international law , and health care law . When she took the job in 1993 , it was announced that she would be referred to as Marilyn Tucker Quayle . In 2010 , Quayle narrated an advertisement for Georgia gubernatorial candidate Karen Handel .
Olivone was a municipality in the district of Blenio in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland . On 25 January 2005 , the cantonal authorities announced that Olivone would merge with Aquila , Campo Blenio , Ghirone and Torre to form a new municipality to be called Blenio . This union was carried through on 22 October 2006 . Olivone is first mentioned in 1193 as Alivoni , then in 1205 it was mentioned as Orivono ' . In Romansh it was known as Luorscha . The political power in the upper Blenio valley was in the hands of a branch of the De Torre family . They owned land in Olivone and possessed the patronage rights in the parish church until the oath of Torre in 1182 ended their supremacy . In 1213 the villages of Olivone and Aquila revolted and united against the Da Locarno family , who had been given power over the valley by canons of Milan . They were able to drive out the Da Locarno 's and return to the previous situation , where they were ruled by a governor out of Lombardy . The L'assemblea di uomini liberi ( The Assembly of the Free ) , which is first mentioned in 1136 , provided for the management of common forests , alpine pastures and helped maintain the Lukmanier and Greina passes . By the end of the 14th Century the L'assemblea di uomini liberi took advantage of Olivone 's lease on the Santa Maria alpine pasture , which belonged to the abbey of Disentis . The village customary law was written down in the statutes of 1237 and 1474 . During the Early Middle Ages , Olivone was probably the center of a parish that was over the whole valley . Starting in the High and Late Middle Ages , the village 's history follows the course of the entire valley . The Parish Church of S. Martino was built before 1136 , and in the 17th century , was rebuilt , followed by renovations in 1974 and 1984-91 . The church contains frescos from the 17th and 18th Centuries . Valuable furnishings and vestments on display in the CÃ da RivÃ i ( RivÃ i means Olivone in the local dialect ) , a building from the 15th Century . On Lukmanier street the hospice of SS Sepolcro e Barnaba at Casaccia , was built in 1104 . This was followed by the Hospice of S. Defendente in Camperio , built in 1254 . The noble families of da Torre and da Lodrino probably founded these two hospices . They were later managed by the neighborhood and had until the 15th Century , were of major social and economic importance . Much of the local economy was based on agriculture ( dairy farming and livestock ) . However , between the 15th Century and the 19th Century , much of the economy depended on money sent back home from emigrants to Italy , France and England as well as other cities in Switzerland . The chocolate makers from Olivone enjoyed a good reputation in Italy and France starting in the 17th Century . In the last decades of the 19th Century , tourism became important . In the 20th Century , tourism grew in importance and initiatives for nature and heritage protection were further promoted . At the beginning of the 21st Century the village was known for its winter and summer tourism . Olivone retained its agricultural character , but in 1956 it became home to the Blenio Kraftwerke AG power plant and certain construction companies . It houses the Alpine Institute of Chemistry and Toxicology ( 2006 ) of the Alpine Foundation for Life Sciences . In 2005 , 22 % of jobs in Olivone were in agriculture .

The Thinker is a bronze and marble sculpture by Auguste Rodin , whose first cast , of 1902 , is now in the MusÃ e Rodin in Paris ; there are some twenty other original castings as well as various other versions , studies , and posthumous castings . It depicts a man in sober meditation battling with a powerful internal struggle . It is often used to represent philosophy . Originally named The Poet , the piece was part of a commission by the MusÃ e des Arts DÃ coratifs , Paris to create a monumental portal to act as the door of the museum . Rodin based his theme on The Divine Comedy of Dante and entitled the portal The Gates of Hell . Each of the statues in the piece represented one of the main characters in the epic poem . The Thinker was originally meant to depict Dante in front of the Gates of Hell , pondering his great poem . ( In the final sculpture , a miniature of the statue sits atop the gates , pondering the hellish fate of those beneath him . ) The sculpture is nude , as Rodin wanted a heroic figure in the tradition of Michelangelo , to represent intellect as well as poetry . More than twenty monumental size bronze casts of the sculpture are in museums around the world . In addition there are sculptures of different study size scales and plaster models in both monumental and study sizes . There are some newer castings that have been produced posthumously and are not considered part of the original production . Rodin made the first small plaster version around 1880 . The first large-scale bronze cast was finished in 1902 , but not presented to the public until 1904 . It became the property of the city of Paris â `` thanks to a subscription organized by Rodin admirers â `` and was put in front of the PanthÃ on in 1906 . In 1922 , it was moved to the HÃ tel Biron , which was transformed into a Rodin Museum . The first cast sculpture can be found in front of Grawemeyer Hall on the University of Louisville Belknap Campus in Louisville , KY. . Made in Paris , it was first displayed at the St. Louis World 's Fair in 1904 and was then gifted to the city . This Thinker sculpture was the only cast created by the lost-wax casting method . The Thinker has been cast in multiple versions and is exhibited around the world .
Vincenzo Salvatore Carmelo Francesco Bellini ( 3 November 1801 -- 23 September 1835 ) was an Italian opera composer . His greatest works are I Capuleti ed i Montecchi ( 1830 ) , La sonnambula ( 1831 ) , Norma ( 1831 ) , Beatrice di Tenda ( 1833 ) , and I puritani ( 1835 ) . Known for his long-flowing melodic lines , for which he was named `` the Swan of Catania , '' Bellini was the quintessential composer of bel canto opera . Born in Catania , Sicily , Bellini was a child prodigy from a highly musical family and legend has it he could sing an aria of Valentino Fioravanti at eighteen months . He began studying music theory at two , the piano at three , and by the age of five could apparently play well . Bellini 's first five pieces were composed when he was just six years old . Regardless of the veracity of these claims , it is certain that Bellini grew up in a musical household and that a career as a musician was never in doubt . Having learned from his grandfather , Bellini left provincial Catania in June 1819 to study at the conservatory in Naples , with a stipend from the municipal government of Catania . By 1822 he was in the class of the director NicolÃ Zingarelli , studying the masters of the Neapolitan school and the orchestral works of Haydn and Mozart . It was the custom at the Conservatory to introduce a promising student to the public with a dramatic work : the result was Bellini 's first opera Adelson e Salvini an opera semiseria that was presented at the Conservatory 's theater . Bellini 's next opera , Bianca e Gernando , met with some success at the Teatro San Carlo , leading to a commission from the impresario Barbaia for an opera at La Scala . Il pirata was a resounding immediate success and began Bellini 's faithful and fruitful collaboration with the librettist and poet Felice Romani , and cemented his friendship with his favored tenor Giovanni Battista Rubini , who had sung in Bianca e Gernando . Bellini spent the next years , 1827 -- 33 in Milan , where all doors were open to him . Sparking controversy in the press for its new style and its restless harmonic shifts into remote keys , La straniera ( 1828 ) was even more successful than Il pirata , and allowed Bellini to support himself solely by his opera commissions . The composer showed the taste for social life and the dandyism that Heinrich Heine emphasized in his literary portrait of Bellini ( Florentinische NÃ chte , 1837 ) . Opening a new theater in Parma , his Zaira ( 1829 ) was a failure at the Teatro Ducale , but Venice welcomed I Capuleti e i Montecchi , which was based on the same Italian source as Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet . The next five years were triumphant , with major successes with his greatest works , La sonnambula , Norma and I puritani , cut short by Bellini 's premature death . Bellini died in Puteaux , near Paris of acute inflammation of the intestine , and was buried in the cemetery of PÃ re Lachaise , Paris ; his remains were removed to the cathedral of Catania in 1876 . The Museo Belliniano housed in the Gravina Cruyllas Palace , in Catania , preserves memorabilia and scores . 1 . Il Fervido Desiderio 2 . Dolente Immagine di Fille Mia 3 . Vaga Luna che Inargenti 1 .

Louis Braille ( Ë breÉ l ; ) ( January 4 , 1809 â `` January 6 , 1852 ) was the inventor of braille , a worldwide system used by blind and visually impaired people for reading and writing . Braille is read by passing the fingers over characters made up of an arrangement of one to six embossed points . It has been adapted to almost every known language . Braille was born in Coupvray , a small town located southeast of Paris in Seine-et-Marne . His father was a saddlemaker , who also crafted harnesses , bags and leather straps . As soon as he could walk , Louis spent time playing in his father 's workshop . At age three , he scratched his right eye while making holes in a piece of leather with a pruning knife or awl that was too heavy for him . There was nothing anyone could do except patch and bind the affected eye . The wound became severely infected and spread to his left eye causing his blindness . At the age of 10 , Braille earned a scholarship to the National Institute for the Blind Youth in Paris , one of the first of its kind in the world . However , living conditions in the school were poor . Louis was served stale bread and water , and students were sometimes abused or locked up as a form of punishment . Despite these circumstances , Braille proved to be a bright and creative student . His ear for music enabled him to become an accomplished cellist and organist in classes taught by Marrigues . ( Later in life , his musical talents this lead him to play the organ for churches all over France , and he held the position of organist in Paris at the Church of Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs 1834 and at the Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul in 1845 . ) Children at the school were taught basic craftsman skills and simple trades . They were also taught how to read by feeling raised letters ( a system devised by the school 's founder , Valentin HaÃ 1\/4 y ) . However , because the raised letters were made using paper pressed against copper wire , the students never learned to write . Another disadvantage was that the letters weighed a lot and whenever people published books using this system , they put together a book with multiple stories in one in order to save money . This made the books sometimes weigh over a hundred pounds . The school had only three books , all of which Louis read . In 1821 , Charles Barbier , a former Captain in the French Army , visited the school . Barbier shared his invention called `` night writing '' , a code of 12 raised dots and a number of dashes that let soldiers share top-secret information on the battlefield without having to speak . The code was too difficult for Louis to understand , but it inspired him to think about developing a system of his own . Louis Braille began to invent his raised-dot system with his father 's stitching awl , the same implement with which he had blinded himself , completing it at age 15 , in 1824 . Rather than 12 raised dots used in Barbier , his system uses only six dots , possibly influenced by wooden dice his father had given to him . Braille 's new system had several advantages . The six-dot system allows the recognition of letters with a single fingertip , which enables comprehension of all the dots at once with no movement or repositioning of fingers that slows understanding in systems requiring more dots . The dots are organized into patterns that keep the system easy to learn . The Braille system also offers numerous benefits over HaÃ 1\/4 y 's raised letter method , the most notable being the ability to both read and write an alphabet . Another very notable benefit is that because they were dots just slightly raised , volumes of text could be smaller , lighter , and easier to produce . Braille later extended his system to include notation for mathematics and music . In 1829 , he published the first book about his system , entitled Method of Writing Words , Music , and Plain Songs by Means of Dots , for Use by the Blind and Arranged for Them . This book was printed by using the raised letter method ( â relief linÃ aireâ in French ) . In 1839 he published details of a method he had developed for communication with sighted people , using patterns of dots to approximate the shape of printed symbols . With his friend Pierre Foucault , he went on to develop a Braille typewriter to speed up the somewhat cumbersome system . Braille became a well-respected teacher at the Institute . Although he was admired and respected by his pupils , his writing system was not taught at the Institute during his lifetime . He died in Paris of tuberculosis in 1852 at the age of 43 , and was buried in Coupvray . His body was disinterred at the centenary of his death in 1952 and he was reinterred with honors in the PanthÃ on in Paris . His system was finally officially recognized in France two years after his death , in 1854 . The 200th anniversary of his birth in 2009 was widely celebrated throughout Europe by exhibitions and symposiums about life and achievements . Belgium and Italy struck 2 euro coins , India struck a 2 rupee coin , and the USA struck a one dollar coin to mark the event .

Roussillon is a commune in the Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-C Ã te d'Azur region in southeastern France . Roussillon lies within the borders of the Parc Naturel RÃ gional de Luberon . In the French natural regional parks , new economic activities may be developed only if they are sustainable . It is noted for its large ochre deposits found in the clay surrounding the village . Ochres are pigments ranging from yellow and orange to red . One of the former ochre quarries can be visited and is known as the Colorado ProvenÃ al . The village is situated in the northern valley of the mountains of Luberon . The nearest railway station is in Cavaillon ; the nearest TGV station is in Avignon . The river Calavon forms part of the commune 's southern border . Roussillon is famous for the rich deposits of ochre pigments found in the clay near the village . The large quarries of Roussillon were mined from the end of the eighteenth century until 1930 . Thousands of people found work in the quarries and factories . Nowadays the mining of ochre is prohibited here , in order to protect the sites from degradation or even complete destruction . Because during the 18th century the demand rose for pigments to be used in the textile industry , the mining of ochres in Roussillon intensified . Numerous quarries and ochre factories , some of which can still be seen today , were situated near the village . An example of an ochre factory , named Mathieu , has been formed into a ` Conservatoire ' : a workshop serving as a museum . The quarries and factories were established in the villages of Roussillon , Villars , Gargas , Rustrel ( with its Colorado provenÃ al ) and Gignac . During the 20th century , mining techniques were modernized , which meant that more profitable ochre mines became exploitable . This resulted in a gradually closing down of ochre mines in and around Roussillon . From the 1980s , tourism has replaced ochre industry as a source of income . The writer Samuel Beckett went into hiding from the Germans in Roussillon during the years 1942-1945 . His novel Watt was written there , and Beckett mentioned the village in his famous theatreplay Waiting for Godot ( En attendant Godot ) ( 1955 ) . Film director Henri Colpi shot this movie Heureux qui comme Ulysse ( 1970 ) with Fernandel as the leading character in Roussillon ; George Brassens wrote a chanson for the film . Under the name of Peyrane , Roussillon is the subject of Laurence Wylie , Village in the Vaucluse ( first edition 1957 . )

The San Francisco Ballet ( SFB ) is a ballet company , founded in 1933 as the San Francisco Opera Ballet . The company is currently based in the War Memorial Opera House , San Francisco , California , under the direction of Helgi Tomasson . SFB is the first professional ballet company in the United States . It is among the world 's leading dance companies , and along with American Ballet Theatre , and the New York City Ballet has been described as part of the `` triumvirate of great classical companies defining the American style on the world stage today . '' The company 's first major production was CoppÃ lia in 1938 , choreographed by Willam Christensen . In 1940 Swan Lake was produced in its entirety for the first time by Americans with principal ballerina Celina Cummings . The company also began showing The Nutcracker during the holiday season , beginning Christmas Eve , 1944 . This too was choreographed by Willam Christensen and was the first complete production of Tchaikovsky 's most popular piece in the United States . In 1942 San Francisco Opera Ballet split in two , forming independent ballet and opera companies . The ballet half was sold to Willam and Harold Christensen , who became artistic director and appointed director of the San Francisco Ballet School , respectively . The San Francisco Ballet Guild was also formed during this time as a support organization for San Francisco Ballet . 1951 saw the next significant shift in administration of San Francisco Ballet . In this year , Lew Christensenâ '' the premier danseur at the timeâ '' partnered with Willam Christensen as co-directors . One year later , Lew took over entirely . With this new administration SFB began to broaden its horizons , travel , and establish itself as a significant American ballet company . Until 1956 , San Francisco Ballet had remained on the West Coast , but Lew pushed the company into the Jacob 's Pillow Dance Festival in Massachusetts . In 1957 SFB was the first American ballet company to tour the Far East , performing in eleven Asian nations . On New Year 's Day in 1965 , ABC-TV televised a one-hour abridgement of the Lew Christensen-choreographed production of `` The Nutcracker '' , featuring San Francisco Ballet . In 1972 Lew brought the company closer to its original home , the War Memorial Opera House , by officially naming the theater as its official residence . The San Francisco Ballet , as part of its 75th anniversary season in 2008 , made a national tour through four major cities : Chicago , the Harris Theater for Music and Dance , Millennium Park , September 16 â `` 21 ; New York City Center , October 10 â `` 18 ; Costa Mesa , California , the Orange County Performing Arts Center , November 11 â `` 16 ; and Washington , D.C. , the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts , November 25 â `` 30 . The tour featured ballets from SFB 's New Works Festival , the finalÃ of their Spring 2008 season , which featured over the course of three consecutive nights premieres of ten new ballets by ten major choreographers . George Balanchine 's choreography to W.A. Mozart 's music , staged by Elyse Borne with costumes after Karinska and Mark Stanley 's lighting . Mark Morris ' choreography to John Adams ' music with Isaac Mizrahi 's costumes and James F. Ingalls ' lighting
A sock is an item of clothing worn on the feet . The foot is among the heaviest producers of sweat in the body , as it is able to produce over a pint of perspiration per day . Socks help to absorb this sweat and draw it to areas where air can evaporate the perspiration . In cold environments , socks decrease the risk of frostbite . Its name is derived from the loose-fitting slipper , called a soccus in Latin , worn by Roman comic actors . Socks have evolved over the centuries from the earliest models which were made from animal skins gathered up and tied around the ankles . In the 8th century BC , the Ancient Greeks wore socks from matted animal hair for warmth . The Romans also wrapped their feet with leather or woven fabrics . By the 5th century AD , socks called `` puttees '' were worn by holy people in Europe to symbolise purity . By 1000 AD , socks became a symbol of wealth among the nobility . From the 16th century onwards , an ornamental design on the ankle or side of a sock has been called a clock . The invention of a knitting machine in 1589 meant that socks could be knitted six times faster than by hand . Nonetheless , knitting machines and hand knitters worked side by side until 1800 . The next revolution in sock production was the introduction of nylon in 1938 . Until then socks were commonly made from silk , cotton and wool . Nylon was the start of blending two or more yarns in the production of socks , a process that still continues . Socks can be created from a wide variety of materials . Some of these materials are cotton , wool , nylon , acrylic , polyester , olefins , ( such as polypropylene ) , or spandex . To get an increased level of softness other materials that might be used during the process can be silk , bamboo , linen , cashmere , or mohair . The color variety of sock choices can be any color that the designers intend to make the sock upon its creation . Sock ` coloring ' can come in a wide range of colors . Sometimes art is also put onto socks to increase their appearance . Colored socks may be a key part of the uniforms for sports , allowing players teams to be distinguished when only their legs are clearly visible . Socks are manufactured in a variety of lengths . Bare or ankle socks extend to the ankle or lower and are often worn casually or for athletic use . Bare socks are designed to create the look of `` bare feet '' when worn with shoes . Knee-high socks are sometimes associated with formal dress or as being part of a uniform , such as in sports ( like football and baseball ) or as part of a school 's dress code or youth group uniform . Over-the-knee socks or socks that extend higher ( thigh-high socks ) are today considered female garments . They were widely worn by children , both boys and girls , during the late-19th and early-20th centuries . , although the popularity varied widely from country to country . A toe sock encases each toe individually the same way a finger is encased in a glove , while other socks have one compartment for the big toe and one for the rest , like a mitten ; most notably Japanese tabi . Both of these allow one to wear flip-flops with the socks . Leg warmers , which are not typically socks , may be replaced with socks in cold climate . In the United Kingdom , a sock 's size is similar to the person 's shoe size ; for example , a foot that has a shoe size of 9 would require a sock sized 8-10 . In some other parts of the world socks are sized differently than shoes . In the U.S. numerical sock size is the length of the foot in inches , whereas shoe size is not . Sock lengths vary , from ankle-high to thigh level . Most sports will require some sort of sock , usually a tube sock to protect one 's legs from being scraped while participating in sport activities . In basketball , tube socks are worn , and in lacrosse , mid-calf socks are required . In football , knee socks are used . They are mostly to stop grass burns . The layer of leather or other material covering the insole of a shoe is also referred to as a sock . When only part of the insole is covered , leaving the forepart visible , this is known as a half-sock . Footwraps , pieces of cloth that are worn wrapped around the feet , were worn with boots before socks became widely available . They remained in use by armies in Eastern Europe up until the beginning of the 21st century . A sock is also used as a holiday item for the seasonal event Christmas , a Christian celebration of the birth of Jesus . The sock , or Christmas stocking , is usually hung by a nail and filled with small presents that Santa brings while the recipients are asleep .
Moving Day is a young adult book of poetry by Ralph Fletcher , illustrated by Jennifer Emery . It was first published in 2006 . Thirty-four short free verse poems that express the feelings of a twelve-year-old boy moving from Massachusetts to Ohio . Some of the topics include packing , the discovery of long-lost treasures , giving things away , and doing things one last time . Kirkus Reviews said `` The poet leaves pretension at the moving-van door and gives readers a real feel for the evocative emotions of a regular kid -- and that regular kid was Fletcher himself . Emery 's accompanying watercolor illustrations are like flashes of family history viewed through hand-swiped frost on windows of memory . They are simple , but they speak volumes . A fine collection . '' Mary Jean Smith in her review for School Library Journal said that `` like shards of glass , Emery 's pencil drawings with their watercolor washes mirror the loss and longing in these poems . '' and she describes the book as `` excellent in relation to other titles on the same subject or in the same genre '' Sylvia M. Vardell in her book Poetry People said that `` the poems are loosely connected one to another to reveal the grieving process of separating from the familiar and slowly establishing new roots in a new place . '' and that `` this collection is a reassuring voice for children who are dealing with one of life 's most challenging transitions . ''

Pas-de-Calais is a department in northern France . Its name is the French equivalent of the Strait of Dover , which it borders . Inhabited since prehistoric times , the Pas-de-Calais region was populated in turn by the Celtic Belgae , the Romans , the Germanic Franks and the Alemanni . During the fourth and fifth centuries , the Roman practice of coopting Germanic tribes to provide military and defense services along the route from Boulogne to Cologne created a Germanic-Romance linguistic border in the region that persisted until the eighth century . Saxon colonization into the region from the fifth to the eighth centuries likely extended the linguistic border somewhat south and west so that by the ninth century most inhabitants north of the line between BÃ thune and Berck spoke a dialect of Middle Dutch , while the inhabitants to the south spoke Picard , a variety of Romance dialects . This linguistic border is still evident today in the toponyms and patronyms of the region . Beginning in the ninth century , the linguistic border began a steady move to north and the east , and by the end of the 15th century Romance dialects had completely displaced those of Dutch . Pas-de-Calais is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on March 4 , 1790 . It was created from parts of the former provinces of Calaisis , formerly English , Boulonnais , Ponthieu and Artois , this last formerly part of the Spanish Netherlands . Some of the costliest battles of World War I were fought in the region . The Vimy Memorial commemorates the Battle of Vimy Ridge and is Canada 's most important memorial to its fallen soldiers . Pas-de-Calais was also the target of Operation Fortitude during World War II , which was an Allied plan to deceive the Germans that the invasion of Europe at D-Day was to occur here , rather than in Normandy . Pas-de-Calais is in the current region of Nord-Pas de Calais and is surrounded by the departments of Nord and Somme , the English Channel , and the North Sea . Its principal towns are , on the coast , Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer , and in Artois , Lens , LiÃ vin , Arras , and Saint-Omer . The economy of the department was long dependent on mining , primarily the coal mines . However , since World War II , the economy has become more diversified . The inhabitants of the department are called Pas-de-Calaisiens . Pas-de-Calais is one of the most heavily populated departments of France , and yet it has no large cities . Calais has only about 80,000 inhabitants , followed closely by Arras , Boulogne-sur-Mer , Lens and LiÃ vin . The remaining population is primarily concentrated along the border with the department of Nord in the mining district , where a string of small towns constitutes an urban area with a population of about 1.2 million . The center and south of the department are more rural , but still quite heavily populated , with many villages and small towns . Although the department saw some of the heaviest fighting of World War I , its population rebounded quickly after both world wars . However , many of the mining towns have seen dramatic decreases in population , some up to half of their population . Although Pas-de-Calais is one of the most populous departments of France , it did not contain a university until 1992 .
CamagÃ 1\/4 ey is the largest of the provinces of Cuba . Its capital is CamagÃ 1\/4 ey . Other towns include Florida and Nuevitas . CamagÃ 1\/4 ey is mostly low lying , with no major hills or mountain ranges passing through the province . Numerous large cays ( including what used to be one of Fidel Castro 's favorite fishing spots ; the ArchipiÃ lago Jardines de la Reina ) characterize the southern coasts , while the northern coast is lined by Jardines del Rey of the Sabana-Camag Ã 1\/4 ey Archipelago . Sandy beaches are found on both coasts also , and despite a large potential for tourism , the province has seen little development in that area with the exception of Santa LucÃ a beach , on the province 's North coast . The economy of the CamagÃ 1\/4 ey province is primarily cattle and sugar ( in the north and south ) farming , and the province is known for its cowboy culture , with rodeos frequently held . Chickens and rice are also farmed , and a small citrus fruit industry exists . The capital city also has one of the few breweries on the island . Source : Population from 2004 Census .

The Soan ( Urdu : Ø Ù Ù ) ( preferred ) , Sawaan ( Urdu : Ø Ù Ø Ú ) , Sawan or Sohan River is a river in Punjab , Pakistan . The Soan River is an important stream of the Pothohar region of Pakistan . It drains much of the water of Pothohar . It starts near a small village Bun in the foothills of Patriata and Murree . It provides water to Simly Dam , which is the water reservoir for Islamabad . Near Pharwala Fort it cuts through a high mountain range , a wonderful natural phenomenon called Soan Cut . No stream can cut such a high mountain , which proves that the Soan was there before the formation of this range . And as the mountain rose through millions of years , the stream continued its path by cutting the rising mountain . Ling stream , following a relatively long course through Lehtrar and Kahuta falls in the Soan near Sihala on southern side of Village Gagri\/Bhandar . Islamabad Highway crosses this stream near Sihala where the famous Cock Pull bridge is constructed over it . The Ling Stream joins the Soan river just before the Cock Pull . Another famous stream , the Lai stream , joins this stream near Soan Camp . After following a tortuous path along a big curve , the stream reaches Kalabagh where it falls into the Indus river . This relatively small stream is more than 250 kilometers long . Due to its mountainous course and shallow bed , it is hardly used for irrigation purposes . Rohu is the main species of fish in this stream and Kingfisher birds hunt here too . It also forms the northern border of Bannu District . The oldest evidence of human life ( 100,000 to 150,000 years ago ) in Pakistan , Soan Culture , was found in the Soan River valley . The river has also been identified with the Sushoma River of the Rig Veda . According to the major Vedic religious work Srimad Bhagavatam , the Sushoma is one of the many transcendental rivers flowing through the land of Bharata .

Hoegaarden is a municipality in the province of Flemish Brabant , in Flanders , one of the three regions of Belgium . The municipality comprises the villages of Hoegaarden proper , Meldert and Outgaarden . On January 1 , 2006 Hoegaarden had a total population of 6,225 . The total area is 33.93 kmÂ which gives a population density of 183 inhabitants per kmÂ . The current village was founded in 981 by the last ruler of the county of Brunengeruz . Countess AlpaÃ dis ( Alpeide ) later gave her county and castle ( today the site of St-Gorgoniuskerk ) to the Prince-Bishop of LiÃ ge . As an enclave of the LiÃ ge prince bishopric the village had tax advantages over the villages in the surrounding Duchy of Brabant leading to the growth of the brewing industry . This tax advantage was lost after the French Revolution once the Prince-Bishopric of LiÃ ge was abolished . The industry had withered to nothing by 1955 but Pierre Celis later relaunched the town 's now iconic white beer which has since gone on to become a global brand . In December 2005 it was decided to close the Hoegaarden Brewery and move the production of the beers to the Jupille brewery in southern Belgium . However the beer could not be brewed there with the right characteristics and so the plan was canceled .
Carlos AndrÃ s Diogo EnseÃ at ( born 18 July 1983 in Montevideo ) is an Uruguayan footballer who plays for Real Zaragoza in La Liga . A player of great physical strength , he operates as a defender or midfielder , on the right side of the pitch . Diogo started his career with River Plate Montevideo and Club AtlÃ tico PeÃ arol , moving to Argentina 's Club AtlÃ tico River Plate in 2004 â `` 05 . In the summer of 2005 , Diogo signed with Spain 's Real Madrid , as compatriot Pablo GarcÃ a , but found first team opportunities scarce . On 23 August 2006 , the Spanish capital outfit decided to send him to fellow La Liga side Real Zaragoza , on a season-long loan . In August 2007 , the move was made permanent , but Madrid agreed to take just â 3 million instead of the initial 4 , inserting a clause in his contract that enabled a total refund of the money , were a top class team to bid for his services . On 6 January 2007 , Diogo was involved in a fight with Sevilla FC 's LuÃ s Fabiano , after apparently stepping on the Brazilian 's hand and insulting him , which led to Fabiano putting Diogo in a strangle-hold in the closing stages of the game . This incident was punished with a five-game ban to both players . Due to a serious knee injury , Diogo missed the entire 2008 â `` 09 season , with the Aragonese now in the second division . He underwent a second operation in April 2009 , being sidelined a further eight months . On 12 December 2009 , with Zaragoza back in the top division , Diogo returned to action with a goal , but in a 2 â `` 1 home loss against Athletic Bilbao , in the league . The player still contributed with a further 14 matches , as the club managed to maintain its division status . An Uruguayan international since 28 March 2003 , playing nine minutes in a 2 â `` 2 friendly match with Japan in Tokyo , Diogo represented the nation at the 2004 and 2007 Copa AmÃ rica tournaments . Diogo is the son of VÃ ctor Diogo , another Uruguayan footballer , whom also played for PeÃ arol , and with some Brazilian clubs .
In computer science , a long integer is a data type that can represent a whole number whose range is greater than or equal to that of a standard integer on the same machine . A variable defined as a long integer in one programming language may be different in size to a similarly defined variable in another . In some languages this size is fixed across platforms , whilst in others it is machine dependent . In some languages this data type does not exist at all . In practice it is usual for a long integer to require double the storage capacity of a standard integer , although this is not always the case . In later C99 version of the C programming language , a type is supported that doubles the minimum capacity of the standard to 64 bits . This type is not supported by compilers that require C code to be C + + ISO compliant , because the type does not currently exist in C + + ( it is defined in the new , yet unfinished , C + + standard , C + +0 x ) . For an ANSI\/ISO compliant compiler the minimum requirements for the specified ranges , that is ( 231 1 ) to 231 1 for signed and 0 to 232 1 for unsigned , must be fulfilled ; however , extending this range is permitted . This can be an issue when exchanging code and data between platforms , or doing direct hardware access . Thus , there are several sets of headers providing platform independent exact width types . The C standard library provides stdint . h ; this was introduced in C99 .
Florence is a city in Boone County , Kentucky , United States . The population was 29,951 at the 2010 census . The Florence area was originally known as Crossroads , because of the convergence of several roads from Burlington and Union at Ridge Road ( now U.S. 25 ) . By 1821 , the area was known as Maddentown , named for Thomas Madden , a Covington attorney who owned a farm on the Burlington Pike . When Madden moved away , the area became known as Connersville in 1828 , for Jacob Conner , a settler who assumed responsibility for the growing town . The town was renamed Florence as another Connersville already existed in Harrison County . It was incorporated on January 27 , 1830 and grew quickly after the completion of the Covington-Lexington Turnpike in 1836 . Florence is located at ( 38.993225 , -84.642602 ) . According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 9.9 s , of which 0.04 s is water .

It is the sixth largest city in the Cincinnati\/Northern Kentucky metropolitan area . Florence is well known in surrounding cities for a water tower visible from I-75 that reads `` Florence Y ` all '' . Originally the tower advertised the up-and-coming Florence Mall , as part of an agreement by the mall developers who donated the land for the tower . However , because the mall was not built yet , the tower violated highway regulations , and the city was forced to change it within a short deadline . Rather than repaint the entire tower , they simply painted over the two vertical lines of the `` M '' to create a `` Y '' . The intent was to change it back when the mall was built , but the local residents liked the tower 's new proclamation , so the city decided to leave it as it was . The city is home to the Florence Freedom independent minor league baseball team . The Freedom have played at Champion Window Field in Florence since the venue 's completion in 2004 .

West Coast or Pacific Coast are terms for the westernmost coastal states of the United States . The term most often refers to the states of California , Oregon , and Washington . Although not part of the contiguous United States , Alaska and Hawaii do border the Pacific Ocean and can also be included in the West Coast as well as the non-coastal states Arizona and Nevada . The U.S. Census groups the five states of California , Oregon , Washington , Alaska , and Hawaii together as the Pacific region . As of 2008 , the estimated population of the Census Bureau 's Pacific Region was approximately 49 million . The estimated population of California , Oregon , and Washington was 47 million . The region includes large cities such as Los Angeles , San Francisco , San Diego , San Jose , Sacramento , Fresno , Long Beach , and Oakland in California , Portland in Oregon , and Seattle , Tacoma and Spokane in Washington . The history of the West Coast begins with the arrival of the earliest known humans of the Americas , Paleo-Indians , crossing the Bering Strait from Eurasia into North America over a land bridge , Beringia , that existed between 45,000 BCE and 12,000 BCE ( 47,000 â `` 14,000 years ago ) . Small isolated groups of hunter-gatherers migrated alongside herds of large herbivores far into Alaska . Between 16,500 BCE and 13,500 BCE ( 18,500 â `` 15,500 years ago ) , ice-free corridors developed along the Pacific coast and valleys of North America and possibly by sea . Alaska Natives , indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast , and California indigenous peoples eventually descended from the Paleo-Indians . They developed various languages and established trade routes . Later , Spanish , British , Mexican , Russian and American explorers and settlers began colonizing the area .
Park Tae-hwan ( born September 27 , 1989 ) is a South Korean swimmer . He is a member of the South Korean national swimming team , based in Taereung , Seoul . He won a gold medal in the 400 meter freestyle and a silver in the 200 meter freestyle events at the 2008 Summer Olympics . He is the first Asian swimmer to win a gold medal in Men 's 400 metre freestyle event , and the first Korean to win a medal in swimming . Born in Seoul in 1989 , Park graduated from Kyunggi High School in February 2008 , and enrolled at Dankook University , where he is majoring in physical education . His father is a saxophone player and his mother is a dancer . He currently serves as a goodwill ambassador for ` Dynamic Korea ' , South Korea 's international image-making campaign , alongside international figure skater Kim Yu-Na . Park Tae-hwan is one of Asia 's top Men 's Freestyle swimmers . He was voted Most Valuable Player at the 2006 Asian Games in Qatar where he won seven medals including three gold . The 19-year-old trains in Melbourne and is also a Pan Pacific Champion . He was voted Swimming World 's Pacific Rim Swimmer of the Year in 2006 . Park began swimming at the age of 5 when his doctor suggested it would be good for his asthma . He began his competitive swimming career at the age of 7 , earning several medals in junior competitions . This early success led to Park 's selection to the Korean Swimming Federation as a national team member in 2003 . At the 2004 Summer Olympics , however , Park was disqualified for a false start in the preliminary heat of the men 's 400m freestyle competition . However , shortly thereafter at the 2004 Fina Swimming World Cup , Park was the runner-up in the men 's 400 meter freestyle event . Park continued his competitive success in subsequent years , most notably at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha , where he won three golds , one silver and three bronze medals , the most medals won by a single athlete at the Games . He also set two Asian Records . For his success , Park was named an Athlete of the Games . At the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Victoria , Canada , Park won two gold medals ( in the 1500 meter freestyle and the 400 meter freestyle ) and one silver medal ( 200 m freestyle ) . Park was named the 2006 Pacific Rim Male Swimmer of the Year by Swimming World Magazine , beating out Olympic medalist ( and 2005 awardee ) Australian Grant Hackett for the honor . At the 2008 Summer Olympics , Park won a gold medal in the 400 meter freestyle event and a silver medal in the 200 meter freestyle event . In swimming 1:44.85 in the 200m freestyle final , Park joined Michael Phelps , Ian Thorpe , and Pieter van den Hoogenband as the only men to have ever swum under 1:45 in the event . Much of the press coverage surrounding Park 's successes emphasize the fact that these are the first Olympic medals in swimming for South Korea . Just after a stunning victory against idol Grant Hackett in the men 's 400m freestyle at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships in Melbourne , Park decided to train alone in Sydney , Australia as his own ' 500-day project ' , parting with his personal managing team in December 2007 . He then joined the Korean national team training base in February 2008 to prepare for the 2008 Beijing Olympics . Under Park 's personal coach Roh Min-sang and other members of the coaching staff , the national team trained in Malaysia ( February 2008 ) and Guam ( May 2008 ) to prepare Park for his second attempt at the Olympics . He qualified for competition in the men 's 200 meter , 400 meter and 1500 meter freestyle events . At the 2009 World Aquatics Championships , Park surprised many after failing to qualify to swim in the finals of the 200 and 400 m freestyle . Some blame Park 's poor performance on his decision to wear Speedo 's LZR Racer in the championships .

The Southern Carpathians or the Transylvanian Alps are a group of mountain ranges which divide central and southern Romania , on one side , and Serbia , on the other side . They cover part of the Carpathian Mountains that is located between the Prahova River in the east and the TimiÅ and Cerna Rivers in the west . To the south they are bounded by the Balkan mountain range in Serbia . The Southern Carpathian group are the second highest group of mountains in the Carpathian Mountain range ( after Tatra ) , reaching heights of over 2,500 m. Although considerably smaller than the Alps , they are classified as having an alpine landscape . Their high mountain character , combined with great accessibility , makes them popular with tourist and scientists . In spite of the heights , some of the most accessible passings in the Carpathians in Romania are along the rivers who cross the mountain range ( the Olt River ) or who form wide valleys ( along the Prahova River Valley or along the Jiu River Valley ) . The South Carpathians represent an intricate pile of tectonic nappes , overthrusted from west eastwards during the Austrian ( Middle Cretaceous ) and Laramian paroxysmal phases , corresponding to various plate fragments . The napes are ( from west eastwards ) : the Supragetic , Getic , Severin and Danubian Units . The Getic Nappe was identified by Murgoci ( 1905 ) , while the general understanding over the Alpine structure of the South Carpathians was later refined by Codarcea ( 1940 ) , Codarcea et al . ( 1961 ) , NÄ stÄ seanu et al . ( 1981 ) , SÄ ndulescu ( 1984 ) , SÄ ndulescu and Dimitrescu ( 2004 ) , and Mutihac ( 1990 ) . The first to apply the global tectonics concepts for the Romanian Carpathians were RÄ dulescu and SÄ ndulescu ( 1973 ) . The Supragetic , Getic Nappes as well as the Danubian Units represent units with both a metamorphic basement and a sedimentary cover , while the Severin Nappe includes only a sedimentary sequence . The Getic Nappe and the Danubian Units sediments include a Palaeozoic sequence ( Upper Carboniferous , Lower Permian ) and a Mesozoic sequence ( Lowermost Jurassic - Middle Cretaceous ) . The Supragetic Nappe comprises mainly metamorphosed rocks ( gneisses , micashists ) , while the Severin Nappe includes only Upper Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous sediments . From east to west , four mountain groups can be identified , separated by different river valleys . The first two groups are steepest on the North side , and the last two are steepest on the South side .
A rip current , commonly miscalled a rip tide , is a strong channel of water flowing seaward from near the shore , typically through the surf line . Typical flow is at 0.5 metres per second ( 1 â `` 2 feet per second ) , and can be as fast as 2.5 metres per second ( 8 feet per second ) . They can move to different locations on a beach break , up to tens of metres ( a few hundred feet ) a day . They can occur at any beach with breaking waves , including the world 's oceans , seas , and large lakes . When wind and waves push water towards the shore , that water is often forced sideways by the oncoming waves . This water streams along the shoreline until it finds an exit back to the sea or open lake water . The resulting rip current is usually narrow and located in a trench between sandbars , under piers or along jetties . A common misconception is that ordinary undertow or even rip currents are strong enough to pull someone under the surface of the water ; in reality the current is strongest at the surface . This strong surface flow tends to dampen incoming waves , leading to the illusion of a particularly calm part of the sea , which may possibly lure some swimmers into the area . The off-shore path taken by a rip current can be demonstrated by placing colored dye at the start of a current at the shoreline . Rip currents are stronger when the surf is rough ( such as during high onshore winds , or when a strong hurricane is far offshore ) or when the tide is low . A more theoretical description involves a quantity known as radiation stress . This is the force ( or momentum flux ) exerted on the water column by the presence of the wave . As a wave shoals and increases in wave height prior to breaking , radiation stress increases . To balance this , the mean surface ( the water level with the wave averaged out ) decreasesâ '' this is known as setdown . As the wave breaks and continues to reduce in height , the radiation stress decreases . To balance this force , the mean surface increasesâ '' this is known as setup . As a wave propagates over a sandbar with a gap ( as shown above ) , the wave breaks on the bar , leading to setup . However , the part of the wave that propagates over the gap does not break , and thus setdown will continue . Thus , the mean surface over the bars is higher than that over the gap , and a strong flow will issue outward through the gap . Rip currents can potentially occur wherever strong longshore variability in wave breaking exists . This variability may be caused by sandbars ( as above ) or even by crossing wave trains . Rip currents are a source of danger for people in ocean and lake surf . They can be extremely dangerous , dragging swimmers away from the beach . Death by drowning comes following exhaustion while fighting the river or ocean current . Although a rare event , rip currents can be deadly for non-swimmers as well : a person standing waist deep in water can be dragged into deeper waters , where they can drown if they are unable to swim and are not wearing a flotation device . Varying topography makes some beaches more likely to have rip currents ; a few are notorious . Rip currents cause more than 100 deaths annually in the United States . Rip currents cause 80 % of rescues needed by beach lifeguards . A swimmer caught in a rip current should not attempt to swim back to shore directly against the rip . This risks exhaustion and drowning . A rip does not pull a swimmer under water ; it carries the swimmer away from the shore in a narrow channel of water . The rip is like a treadmill which the swimmer needs to step off . The swimmer should remain calm and swim parallel to the shore until he or she is outside of the current . Locations to aim for are places where waves are breaking . In these areas , floating objects are generally transported towards the shore . A swimmer in a strong rip , who is unable to swim away from it , should relax and calmly float or tread water to conserve energy . Eventually the rip will lose strength , and the swimmer can swim at a leisurely pace , in a diagonal direction , away from the rip but back to shore . Coastal swimmers should understand the danger of rip currents , learn how to recognize them and how to escape from them , and always swim in areas where lifeguards are operating .
Caesalpinioideae is a botanical name at the rank of subfamily , placed in the large family Fabaceae or Leguminosae . Its name is formed from the generic name Caesalpinia . The Caesalpinioideae are mainly trees distributed in the moist tropics . Their flowers are zygomorphic , but are very variable . Nodulation is rare in this subfamily , and where it does occur nodules have a primitive structure . Because the Papilionoideae and Mimosoideae arose from within the Caesalpinioideae , the Caesalpinioideae is paraphyletic . Therefore , it is likely to be split into several subfamilies , although it is not yet clear what those subfamilies should be . In some classifications , for example the Cronquist system , the group is recognized at the rank of family , Caesalpiniaceae . The genera may be classified in four tribes , Caesalpinieae , Cassieae , Cercideae and Detarieae . The tribe Cercideae has sometimes been included in the subfamily Faboideae ( aka Papilionoideae ) in the past . About 81 genera of predominantly African distribution . See main article for details .
Paprika is a spice made from the grinding of dried fruits of Capsicum annuum ( e.g. , bell peppers or chili peppers ) . In many European languages , the word paprika refers to bell peppers themselves . The seasoning is used in many cuisines to add color and flavor to dishes . Paprika can range from mild to hot . Flavors also vary from country to country . In modern times , the word paprika is said to be derived from the Hungarian paprika or the Serbo-Croatian paprika ( Ð Ð Ð Ñ Ð Ð Ð ) ; meaning pepper ( Capsicum ) . The Hungarian paprika is a diminutive form of the Bosnian\/Croatian\/Serbian \/ Montenegrin papar , derived from the Latin piper or Modern Greek piperi . It came into currency in the 19th century . According to Hindu legend , paprika is said to have been named after a religious Indian figure named `` Rysh Paprike '' . Paprika is produced in a number of places including Spain , Hungary , and California . It is used as an ingredient in a broad variety of dishes throughout the world . Paprika is principally used to season and color rices , stews , and soups , such as goulash , and in the preparation of sausages as an ingredient that is mixed with meats and other spices . In the United States , paprika is frequently sprinkled on foods as a garnish , but the flavor is more effectively produced by heating it gently in oil . Spanish Paprika ( PimentÃ n ) is available in three versions , mild ( PimentÃ n Dulce ) , moderately spicy ( PimentÃ n Agridulce ) , and very spicy ( PimentÃ n Picante . ) Some Spanish paprika , including PimentÃ n de la Vera has a distinct smokey flavor and aroma as it is dried by smoking , typically using oak wood . Hungary is a major source of paprika and is thus more commonly used . It is available in grades ranging as follows : Special quality ( KÃ 1\/4 lÃ nleges ) the mildest , very sweet with a deep bright red color . Delicate ( csÃ pÅ ` smentes csemege ) â `` color from light to dark red , a mild paprika with a rich flavor . Exquisite Delicate ( Csemegepaprika ) â `` similar to Delicate , but more pungent . Pungent Exquisite Delicate ( CsÃ pÅ ` s Csemege , PikÃ ns ) - an even more pungent version of Delicate . Rose ( RÃ zsa ) â `` pale red in color with strong aroma and mild pungency . Noble Sweet ( Ã desnemes ) â `` the most commonly exported paprika ; bright red and slightly pungent . Half-Sweet ( FÃ lÃ des ) â `` A blend of mild and pungent paprikas ; medium pungency . Strong ( ErÅ ` s ) â `` light brown in color , the hottest paprika . The Netherlands is a major production and distribution source of paprika as well , especially grown in greenhouses . Paprika can also be used with henna to bring a reddish tint to hair when coloring it . Paprika powder can be added to henna powder when prepared at home . Capsicum peppers used for paprika are unusually rich in vitamin C , a fact discovered in 1932 by Hungary 's 1937 Nobel prize-winner Albert Szent-Gy Ã rgyi . Much of the vitamin C content is retained in paprika , which contains more vitamin C by weight than does lemon juice . Paprika is also high in other antioxidants , containing about 10 % of the level found in aÃ aÃ berries . Prevalence of nutrients , however , must be balanced against quantities ingested , which are generally negligible for spices .
Asclepias californica is a species of milkweed known by the common name California milkweed . It grows throughout lower northern , central and southern California . Asclepias californica is native to California and northern Baja California . It is a flowering perennial with thick , white , woolly stems which bend or run along the ground . The plentiful , hanging flowers are rounded structures with reflexed corollas and starlike arrays of bulbous anthers . The flowers are dull to bright shades of lavender or pink . This plant was eaten as candy by the Kawaiisu tribes of indigenous California ; the milky sap within the leaves is flavorful and chewy when cooked . Asclepias californica is an important and specific Monarch butterfly food plant in nectar and vegetation , and cocoon habitat plant . The alkaloids they ingest from the plant are retained in the butterfly , making it unpalatable to predators .
The River Forth ( Gaelic : Uisge For or Abhainn Dhubh , meaning `` black river '' ) , 47 km ( 29 miles ) long , is the major river draining the eastern part of the central belt of Scotland . The Forth rises in Loch Ard in the Trossachs , a mountainous area some 30 km ( 19 miles ) west of Stirling . It flows roughly eastward , through Aberfoyle , joining with the Duchray Water and Kelty Water , and out over the flat expanse of the Flanders Moss . It is then joined by the River Teith ( which itself drains Loch Venachar , Loch Lubnaig , Loch Katrine , and Loch Voil ) and the River Allan , before meandering through the ancient city of Stirling . At Stirling the river widens and becomes tidal , and it is here that the last ( seasonal ) ford of the river exists . From Stirling , the Forth flows east over the Carse of Stirling and past the towns of Cambus ( where it is joined by the river Devon ) , Alloa , Fallin and Airth . Upon reaching Kincardine the river begins to widen into an estuary , the Firth of Forth . There are a number of towns which line the shores , as well as the petrochemical complexes at Grangemouth , the commercial docks at Leith , oilrig construction yards at Methil , the ship-breaking facility at Inverkeithing and the naval dockyard at Rosyth , with numerous other industrial areas including the Forth Bridgehead area , Burntisland , Kirkcaldy , Bo ` ness and Leven . In medieval times the Forth was navigable at least as far as Stirling , but silting and the increase in ship sizes now mean that traffic upstream of Kincardine is rare . Upstream of Stirling , the river is rather small and is crossed in numerous places ( although prior to modern drainage works , the ground was often treacherously marshy near the riverbank ) . After its confluence with the Teith and Allan , the river is sufficiently wide that a significant bridge is required . A bridge has existed at Stirling since at least the 13th century , and until the opening of the road crossing at Kincardine in 1936 , Stirling remained the easternmost road crossing . The Clackmannanshire Bridge just upstream of the Kincardine Bridge opened on Wednesday , 19th November 2008 . Much further downstream joining North Queensferry and South Queensferry is the famous Forth bridge ( a railway bridge ) opened in 1890 , and the Forth Road Bridge which opened in 1964 . A swinging railway bridge between Alloa on the north shore and Throsk on the south opened in 1885 and was closed ( and largely demolished ) in 1970 . Plans to construct a new road bridge slightly to the West of the existing Forth Road Bridge have been announced by the Scottish Government . It is planned to open in 2016 .

The Vale do AÃ o Metropolitan Region ( RegiÃ # o Metropolitana do Vale do AÃ o , in portuguese ) is a metropolitan area in Minas Gerais , Brazil , comprising only the four municipalities of Coronel Fabriciano , Ipatinga , Santana do ParaÃ so and TimÃ teo , but have an influence area of 22 other municipalities . The name means Steel Valley in Portuguese . This region is also known as `` a RegiÃ # o de Siderurgia '' ( Ironcasting Region ) , as it holds a great number of iron and steel processing companies along the course of the Rio Doce and its tributary , the Rio Piracicaba . The industrialization was possible after the construction of the Estrada de Ferro VitÃ ria Minas , a large railway that crossed almost untouched forest regions in the 1920s , to connect the Metroplitan Area of VitÃ ria to Belo Horizonte . Soon after the conclusion of the railway , the ironcasting Belgo-Mineira started its activity in Coronel Fabriciano , buying local timber for charcoal production , using the it as fuel for its factories . In 1944 Acesita , now called ArcelorMittal TimÃ teo , is installed in nowadays TimÃ teo . Acesita produces special steel , mainly the stainless steel . In 1948 the municipiality of Coronel Fabriciano is emancipated , including in its domains the area of nowadays TimÃ teo and Ipatinga . In 1956 Usiminas is installed in the region of Ipatinga . In 1964 both Ipatinga and TimÃ teo are separated from Coronel Fabriciano . In 1973 Cenibra is installed in Belo Oriente , a municipality located in Vale do aÃ o 's influence area . The metropolitan area was officially defined in 1998 and has a population of 430,700 ( IBGE estimate 2005 ) . There is oficially no main city in the Metropolitan Area of Vale do AÃ o. However , Ipatinga is much larger than the other cities , with about 240,000 inhabitants . The second largest city is Coronel Fabriciano , with about 105,000 inhabitants , followed by TimÃ teo , that has 80,000 . The largest industries of the region are ArcelorMittal TimÃ teo and Usiminas , both iron-casting . Cenibra , a pulp factory in Belo Oriente , is also large . There are several other minor industries , some of them heavily connected with the major ones , as suppliers or costumers of its products . The region has a large eucalyptus monoculture , that was initially used to make charcoal for iron-casting . Lately , imported mineral charcoal was adopted in Usiminas and Acesita , so the eucalyptus is now mainly used to supply the pulp factory of Cenibra as raw material .

Squashes generally refer to four species of the genus Cucurbita native to Mexico and Central America , also called marrows depending on variety or the nationality of the speaker . These species include C. maxima ( hubbard squash , buttercup squash , some varieties of prize pumpkins , such as Big Max ) , C. mixta ( cushaw squash ) , C. moschata ( butternut squash ) , and C. pepo ( most pumpkins , acorn squash , summer squash , zucchini ) . In North America , squash is loosely grouped into summer squash or winter squash , depending on whether they are harvested as immature fruit ( summer squash ) or mature fruit ( autumn squash or winter squash ) . Gourds are from the same family as squashes . Well known types of squash include the pumpkin and zucchini . Giant squash are derived from Cucurbita maxima and are routinely grown to weights nearing those of giant pumpkins . For more details , refer to list of gourds and squashes . Archaeological evidence suggests that squash may have been first cultivated in Mesoamerica some 8,000 to 10,000 years ago , and may have been independently cultivated elsewhere at a later date . Squash was one of the `` Three Sisters '' planted by Native Americans . The Three Sisters were the three main native crop plants : maize ( corn ) , beans , and squash . These were usually planted together , with the cornstalk providing support for the climbing beans , and shade for the squash . The squash vines provided ground cover to limit weeds . Weeds can be detrimental to the growing conditions of the squash . The beans provided nitrogen fixing for all three crops . Summer squashes , including zucchini ( also known as courgette ) , pattypan and yellow crookneck are harvested during the growing season , while the skin is still soft and the fruit rather small ; they are eaten almost immediately and require little to no cooking . Winter squashes ( such as butternut , Hubbard , buttercup , ambercup , acorn , spaghetti squash and pumpkin ) are harvested at maturity , generally the end of summer , cured to further harden the skin , and stored in a cool place for eating later . They generally require longer cooking time than summer squashes . ( Note : Although the term winter squash is used here to differentiate from summer squash , it is also commonly used as a synonym for Cucurbita maxima . ) The squash fruit is classified as a pepo by botanists , which is a special type of berry with a thick outer wall or rind formed from hypanthium tissue fused to the exocarp ; the fleshy interior is composed of mesocarp and endocarp . The pepo , derived from an inferior ovary , is characteristic of the Squash Family ( Cucurbitaceae ) . In culinary terms , both summer and winter squashes are generally considered as vegetables , even though pumpkin may be used for sweet dishes . In addition to the fruit , other parts of the plant are edible . Squash seeds can be eaten directly , ground into paste , meal , `` nut '' butter , even a fine flour , or ( particularly for hulless pumpkins ) pressed for vegetable oil ( e.g. bottle gourd , buffalo gourd , and pumpkin seed oils ) . The shoots , leaves , and tendrils can be eaten as greens . The blossoms are an important part of native American cooking and are also used in many other parts of the world . Both the male and female blossoms can be harvested pre - or mid-flower . As with all other members of the family , the flowers come in pollen-bearing male form , and the ovary-bearing female form , with both forms being present on the plant . Squash has historically been pollinated by the native North American squash bee Peponapis pruinosa , and related species , but this bee and its relatives have declined , probably due to pesticide sensitivity , and most commercial plantings are pollinated by European honey bees today . One hive per acre ( 4,000 mÂ per hive ) is recommended by the US Department of Agriculture . Gardeners with a shortage of bees often have to hand pollinate . Giant squash grown competitively are usually hand pollinated . Flowers are kept closed before and after pollination to prevent cross pollination . Inadequately pollinated female squash flowers will usually start growing but abort before full development . Many gardeners blame various fungal diseases for the aborted fruit , but the fix proves to be better pollination not fungicide . Though considered a vegetable in cooking , botanically speaking , squash is a fruit ( being the receptacle for the plant 's seeds ) . Squash can be served fresh ( in salads ) and cooked ( squash stuffed with meat , fried squash , baked squash ) . Small pattypans are good for pickling . The English word `` squash '' derives from askutasquash ( a green thing eaten raw ) , a word from the Narragansett language , which was documented by Roger Williams , the founder of Rhode Island , in his 1643 publication A Key Into the Language of America . Similar words for squash exist in related languages of the Algonquian family such as Massachusett . The squash has been an essential crop in the Andes since the pre-Columbian Era . The Moche culture from Northern Peru made ceramics from earth , water , and fire . This pottery was a sacred substance , formed in significant shapes and used to represent important themes . Squash are represented frequently in Moche ceramics .
Violaceae ( alternatively Alsodeiaceae J.G. Agardh , Leoniaceae DC . and Retrosepalaceae Dulac ) is a family of flowering plants consisting of about 800 species in 21 genera . It takes its name from the genus Viola , the violets and pansies . Older classifications such as the Cronquist system placed Violaceae in an order named after it , the Violales . However , newer classifications such as that of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group locate it in the Malpighiales . Though the best-known genus , Viola , is herbaceous , most species are shrubs or small trees . The simple leaves are alternate or opposite , often with leafy stipules or the stipules are reduced in size . Some species have palmate shaped leaves or deeply dissected leaves . Many species are acaulescent . Inflorescence with solitary flowers or paniculate like , some species have cleistogamous flowers produced after or before the production of typically petaled flowers . Flowers are bisexual or unisexual ( e.g. Melicytus ) , typically zygomorphic or actinomorphic with a calyx of five sepals that are persistent after flowering . Corolla with 5 mostly unequal petals , the anterior petal larger and often spurred . Plants with five stamens with the abaxial stamen often spurred at the base . The gynoecium is a compound pistil of three united carpels with one locule . Styles simple , ovary superior , ovules many . The fruits are capsules splitting by way of three seams . Seeds with endosperm . four subfamilies are recognized : the Violoideae , the Leonioideae and the Fusispermoideae .

In basic mathematics , a number line is a picture of a straight line on which every point is assumed to correspond to a real number and every real number to a point . Often the integers are shown as specially-marked points evenly spaced on the line . Although this image only shows the integers from 9 to 9 , the line includes all real numbers , continuing `` forever '' in each direction , and also numbers not marked that are between the integers . It is often used as an aid in teaching simple addition and subtraction , especially involving negative numbers . It is divided into two symmetric halves by the origin , i.e. the number zero . In advanced mathematics , the expressions real number line , or real line are typically used to indicate the above-mentioned concept that every point on a straight line corresponds to a single real number , and vice versa . The number line is usually represented as being horizontal . Customarily , positive numbers lie on the right side of zero , and negative numbers lie on the left side of zero . An arrowhead on either end of the drawing is meant to suggest that the line continues indefinitely in the positive and negative real numbers , denoted by . The real numbers consist of irrational numbers and rational numbers , as well as the integers , whole numbers , and the natural numbers ( the counting numbers ) . A line drawn through the origin at right angles to the real number line can be used to represent the imaginary numbers . This line , called imaginary line , extends the number line to a complex number plane , with points representing complex numbers .

The term robber baron is the name given to unscrupulous and despotic nobility of the medieval period in Europe . It has slightly different meanings in different countries . In modern US parlance , the term is used to describe unscrupulous industrialists . For one thousand years , from 800 AD to 1800 AD , tolls were collected from ships sailing on the Rhine River in Europe . During this time , various feudal lords , among them archbishops who held fiefs from the Holy Roman Emperor , collected tolls from passing cargo ships to bolster their finances . Only the Holy Roman Emperor could authorize the collection of such tolls . Allowing the nobility and Church to collect tolls from the busy traffic on the Rhine seems to have been an attractive alternative to other means of taxation and funding of government functions . They abused their positions by stopping passing merchant ships and demanding tolls without being authorized by the Holy Roman Emperor to do so . Often iron chains were stretched across the river to prevent passage without paying the toll , and strategic towers were built to facilitate this . The Holy Roman Emperor and the various noblemen and archbishops who were authorized to levy tolls seem to have worked out an informal way of regulating this process . While this decision process was made no less complex by being informal , common factors included the local power structure ( archbishops and nobles being the most likely recipients of a charter to collect tolls ) , space between toll stations ( authorized toll stations seem to have been at least five kilometers apart ) , and ability to be defended from attack ( some castles through which tolls were collected were tactically useful until the French invaded in 1689 and leveled them ) . Tolls were standardized either in terms of an amount of silver coin allowed to be charged or an `` in-kind '' toll of cargo from the ship . In contrast , the men who came to be known as robber barons violated the structure under which tolls were collected on the Rhine either by charging higher tolls than the standard or by operating without authority from the Holy Roman Emperor altogether . Writers of the period referred to these practices as `` unjust tolls , '' and not only did the robber barons thereby violate the prerogatives of the Holy Roman Emperor , they also went outside of the society 's behavioral norms , since merchants were bound both by law and religious custom to charge a `` just price '' for their wares . During the period in the history of the Holy Roman Empire known as the Interregnum ( 1250 -- 1273 ) , when there was no Emperor , the number of tolling stations exploded in the absence of imperial authority . In addition , robber barons began to earn their newly-coined term of opprobrium by robbing ships of their cargoes , stealing entire ships and even kidnapping . In response to this organized , military lawlessness , the `` Rheinischer Bund , '' or Rhine League was formed by and from the nobility , knights , and lords of the Church , all of whom held large stakes in the restoration of law and order to the Rhine . Officially launched in 1254 , the Rhine League wasted no time putting robber barons out of business by the simple expedient of taking and destroying their castles . In the next three years , four robber barons were targeted and between ten and twelve robber castles destroyed or inactivated . The Rhine League was not only successful in suppressing illicit collection of tolls and river robbery . On at least one occasion , they intervened to rescue a kidnap victim who had been kidnapped by the Baron of Rietberg . The procedure pioneered by the Rhine League for dealing with robber barons -- to besiege , capture and destroy their castles -- survived long after the League self-destructed from political strife over the election of a new Emperor and military reversals against unusually strong robber barons . When the Interregnum ended , the new Emperor Rudolf of Habsburg applied the lessons learned by the Rhine League to the destruction of the highway robbers at Sooneck , torching their castle and hanging them . While robber barony never entirely ceased , especially during the Hundred Years ' War , the excesses of their heyday during the Interregnum never recurred . The reign of King Stephen of England ( 1096-1154 AD ) was a long period of civil unrest commonly known as `` The Anarchy '' . In the absence of strong central kingship , the nobility of England were a law unto themselves , as characterized in this excerpt from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle : The term robber baron was popularized by US political and economic commentator Matthew Josephson during The Great Depression in a 1934 book . He attributed its first use to an 1880 anti-monopoly pamphlet in which Kansas farmers applied the term to railroad magnates .

Robert KovaÄ ( ; born 6 April 1974 in Berlin , West Germany ) is a retired Croatian football defender . KovaÄ started his career in lower league clubs Rapide Wedding and Hertha Zehlendorf before making his Bundesliga debut with 1 . FC Nuremberg in 1995 . Regularly featuring in the firstâ `` eleven , KovaÄ attracted much attention to himself and was signed at the end of the season by Leverkusen . He spent the next five seasons in Leverkusen without any significant success , as the club did not win any trophy during that period , although they were three times FuÃ ball-Bundesliga runnersâ `` up . After his contract expired he went to join reigning champions of 2000 â `` 01 season and UEFA Champions League title holders , Bayern Munich . In four seasons with Bayern he won two Budesliga titles , two German Cup titles and 2001 Intercontinental Cup . On 15 July 2005 , he signed for Juventus . He was one of the few firstâ `` team players that decided to stay in Juve following its demotion to Serie B. He made a total of 35 appearances and scored one goal before he moved back to Germany , this time for Borussia Dortmund . On 1 August 2007 , he signed for Borussia Dortmund , alongside another Croatian national team star , Mladen PetriÄ , who signed for the club two months earlier . KovaÄ had an unsuccessful comeback to FuÃ ball-Bundesliga and was sold to Dinamo Zagreb at the winter transfer window of 2008 â `` 09 season . On 29 January 2009 , close to the January transfer window deadline , he signed 1 and a half year contract with Croatian champions Dinamo Zagreb . The club previously tried to sign him in the summer of 2007 , but failed to meet his demands . Borussia Dortmund were compensated with â 450,000 . In his debut season KovaÄ made 12 appearances in the league and 2 more in Croatian Cup . He started the 2009 â `` 10 season with a foot injury and missed all of Dinamo 's matches in July and August , but returned to action at the start of the September . KovaÄ finished the season with a total of 22 appearances for Dinamo in all competitions , before it was officially announced on 1 June 2010 that he retired from active football . He represented Croatia in 2 World Cups , 2002 and 2006 , and has also participated at two European Championships , 2004 and 2008 . At World Cup 2006 he played well in defense , however after picking up a second yellow against Japan he missed the final group match against Australia through suspension . Without KovaÄ , Croatia struggled in defense with his replacement Tomas committing handball for Australia 's first goal via penalty kick . Croatia eventually drew 2 â `` 2 with Australia but were eliminated from the tournament . With Croatia , Leverkusen , and Bayern , KovaÄ was teammates with his older brother Niko KovaÄ . He retired from the national team in the fall of 2009 , being a captain of the team after his brother 's retirement in 2008 . Robert KovaÄ , along with his older brother Niko , was born in Berlin to a family of Bosnian Croats immigrants . He is married to a former Croatian model and Miss World 1995 first runner-up , Anica KovaÄ , who also originates from Croatian diaspora in Berlin .

During his stay with Lyn , Al-Habsi greatly contributed to the team . Former Bolton Manager Sam Allardyce said : `` It is very satisfying to finally sign Ali . We 've been monitoring his development for quite some time and I am delighted that he has selected us ahead of a number of other high profile clubs who were keen to sign him . '' His transfer from Lyn Oslo to Bolton in January 2006 was a transfer highlighted in the Stevens inquiry report , in June 2007 . The report expressed concerns because of the apparent conflict of interest between agent Craig Allardyce , his father Sam Allardyce â `` and the club itself . Al-Habsi did not make any first team appearances in his first year at Bolton , though he was on the bench a number of times , and played regularly for the reserve side . Al-Habsi made his full Bolton debut in the 2 â `` 1 extra time League Cup victory over Fulham in September 2007 . Al-Habsi then went on to make a further 15 appearances during the course of the 2007\/08 season , most notable was his performance against Bayern Munich in the UEFA Cup were he produced several good saves against the star studded German team . He made his first Premier League start against Wigan Athletic . He earned praise for some notable performances that helped Bolton avoid relegation to The Championship , on the last day of the season . In December 2008 , he was rewarded for his work with a extension to his contract until 2013 . Despite this , Al-Habsi lost his place when JÃ Ã skelÃ inen returned from injury . This resulted in him being heavily linked with a move away from the club to Galatasaray . On 15 July 2010 , Al-Habsi joined Premier League rivals Wigan Athletic on loan for the 2010\/11 season . He made his debut on 24 August 2010 in a Carling Cup match against Hartlepool United , and made his first Premier League start for the club on 28 August 2010 against Tottenham Hotspur , where he was named man of the match after an impressive performance . Ali began playing in his native Oman at the age of seventeen , and joined the ranks of the Oman under-19s squad , before he was spotted by John Burridge in 2001 . Due to the difficulty of securing a work permit , he was unable to move to Europe at this early stage of his career . He was called-up for Oman , and played in all of their three group matches at the 2004 AFC Asian Cup in China and also made four appearances for the team in their qualifying campaign for the 2006 FIFA World Cup , which they excelled in the first group stage after finishing second in a group with Japan , India and Singapore . He was also Oman 's first-choice goalkeeper at the 2007 AFC Asian Cup , appearing in all of their three group matches . Al-Habsi also has appeared as main keeper in 4 consecutive Gulf Cups . In each tournament he earned the award for best goalkeeper , most recently at the 2009 Gulf Cup of Nations . He kept a clean sheet throughout the 2009 tournament that Oman eventually won . Currently Al-Habsi has 70 international caps for Oman . Al-Habsi has won the best goalkeeper award in the Gulf Cup four times in a row . He has also won `` Best Arab Goalkeeper of the Year '' , as well as the , `` Best Goalkeeper Award '' in Norway in 2004 .
Thelyphonida is an arachnid order comprising invertebrates commonly known as vinegaroons . They are often called uropygids in the scientific community after the former order Uropygi ( which originally also included the order Schizomida ) . They are also known as whip scorpions because of their resemblance to true scorpions and because of their whiplike tails . The name `` uropygid '' means `` tail rump '' , from Greek ( ' ) , from ( ' ) `` tail '' and ( ' ) `` rump '' referring to the whip-like flagellum on the end of the pygidium , a small plate made up of the last three segments of the abdominal exoskeleton . Vinegarroons range from 25 t in length , with most species not longer than 30 m ; the largest species , of the genus Mastigoproctus , reaching 85 m. Like the related orders Schizomida , Amblypygi , and Solifugae , the vinegarroons use only six legs for walking , having modified their first two legs to serve as antennae-like sensory organs . Many species also have very large scorpion-like pedipalps ( pincers ) . They have one pair of eyes at the front of the cephalothorax and three on each side of the head , a pattern also found in scorpions . Vinegarroons have no venom glands , but they do have glands near the rear of their abdomen that can spray a combination of acetic acid and octanoic acid when they are bothered . The acetic acid gives this spray a vinegar-like smell , giving rise to the common name vinegarroon . Vinegarroons are carnivorous , nocturnal hunters feeding mostly on insects and millipedes , but sometimes on worms and slugs . Mastigoproctus sometimes preys on small vertebrates . The prey is crushed between special teeth on the inside of the trochanters ( the second segment of the leg ) of the front legs . They are valuable in controlling the population of roaches and crickets . Males secrete a sperm sac , which is transferred to the female . Up to 35 eggs are laid in a burrow , within a mucous membrane that preserves moisture . Mothers stay with the eggs and do not eat . The white young that hatch from the eggs climb onto their mother 's back and attach themselves there with special suckers . After the first molt they look like miniature vinegarroons , and leave the burrow ; the mother dies soon after . The young grow slowly , going through three molts in about three years before reaching adulthood . They live for up to another four years . Vinegarroons are found in tropical and subtropical and Hot Dry areas worldwide . They are missing in Europe , Australia , and , except for an introduced species , in Africa . They usually dig underground burrows with their pedipalps , to which they transport their prey . They may also burrow under logs , rotting wood , rocks , and other natural debris . They prefer humid , dark places and avoid light . As of 2006 , over 100 species of vinegarroons have been described worldwide . Subtaxa of vinegarroons currently include only one extant family and a doubtful extinct family : Rowland & Cooke ( 1973 ) provided a useful synopsis of the order , including a key to genera and a checklist of species . They also presented a novel classification that included the division of the group into two families , Thelyphonidae and Hypoctonidae . Weygoldt ( 1979 ) suggested the existence of two families was not supported by the available data , and Haupt & Song ( 1996 ) formally reduced the Hypoctonidae to a subfamily as there was little support for a monophyletic Hypoctonidae . Dunlop & Horrocks ( 1996 ) suggested that the hypoctonids may be the sister-group to the Schizomida and Proschizomus Dunlop & Horrocks 1996 , but the character polarities they utilized were regarded as uncertain and many features of Proschizomus were not observable in the fossilized material .

Mothballs are small balls of chemical pesticide and deodorant used when storing clothing and other articles susceptible to damage from mold or moth larvae ( especially clothes moths like Tineola bisselliella ) . Another remedy used for the same purpose is cedar wood balls . Their use when clothing is stored out-of-season gave rise to the colloquial usage of the terms `` mothballed '' and `` put into mothballs '' to refer to anything which is put into storage or whose operation is suspended . Older mothballs consisted primarily of naphthalene , but due to naphthalene 's flammability , modern mothballs use 1,4-dichlorobenzene instead . Both of these ingredients have a strong , pungent odor often associated strongly with mothballs . Camphor , an insect repellent , can also be used in mothballs . Both chemicals kill moths and moth larvae with the vapor . Both naphthalene and para-dichlorobenzene sublimate , meaning they go from a solid straight to a vapor . The vapor is toxic to the moths . For either of these chemicals to be effective , they need to be placed with the clothing in a sealed container so the vapors can build up and kill the moths . In a sealed atmosphere like this , the vapors are not harmful to people because they are contained . The main threat would occur when opening the containers , or from wearing clothes immediately after opening ( especially a problem for infants ) . A solution is to open the containers outside and let the clothes hang and air out for a day before wearing . Another remedy used for the same purpose is cedar wood balls . Cedar oils , at concentrations present in cedar chests , closets and scented wood blocks , have almost no value as moth or beetle repellents . The value of a cedar chest is that the chest is tightly closed , thus preventing entry of moths or beetles . In addition to repelling insects such as moths and silverfish , mothballs are used as a stovepipe cleaner , snake repellent , and to keep away mice or other pests . Mothballs have also been used by some campers to keep bears away from their food or even their entire campsite . The main concern about the use of mothballs as a snake , mouse , or animal repellent is their easy access to children , pets , and beneficial animals . Leaving them in a garden or in a living space unprotected makes it very easy for unintended victims such as children and pets to gain access to them . Mothballs are highly toxic when ingested , causing serious illness or death . In addition to this , using a very large quantity of mothballs in a basement or a living space may cause serious respiratory problems in people living in the space . It has also been suggested that the toxic chemical in mothballs will bond to garden soil , causing damage to it . Research has shown that a weak bond can occur , but naturally occurring soil microbes will break down the toxic component of mothballs over extended periods of time . In addition to this , the toxic effects of mothballs may also kill beneficial soil insects while it is present in soil . Mothballs have been used for solvent abuse by adolescents . Mothballs have also been found to be a carcinogen . In the Mythbusters episode `` Scuba Diver , Car Capers '' , it was shown to be `` plausible '' that adding mothballs to a car 's fuel tank would increase its horsepower .
Shunichiro Zaitsu ( born 23 January 1987 ) is a Japanese football player .
Truls Olaf Otterbech MÃ rk ( born 25 April 1961 ) is a Norwegian cellist . MÃ rk was born in Bergen , Norway , the son of two professional musicians , his father a cellist and his mother a pianist . His mother began teaching him the piano when he was seven . He also played the violin , but soon switched to the cello , taking lessons from his father . MÃ rk began his studies with Frans Helmerson at 17 at the renowned Edsberg Music Institute . An admirer of Mstislav Rostropovich and the Russian school of cello , MÃ rk went on to study with the Russian cellist Natalia Shakhovskaya . In 1982 , MÃ rk became the first Scandinavian musician to reach the finals of the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow and won 6th Prize . He subsequently went on to win 2nd prize at the 1986 Naumburg Competition in New York and , in 1986 , the Cassado Cello Competition in Florence . In 1989 , he embarked on his first major concert tour , soloing with many of the finest orchestras of Europe . In 1994 , he toured the United States with the Oslo Philharmonic , including debuts at Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center . At present , MÃ rk is large in the international concert scene . His extensive discography spans from a Grammy-award-winning recording of the Shostakovich Cello Concertos to a critically acclaimed recording of Bach 's Suites for Solo Cello . MÃ rk 's passionate interest in chamber music led to the foundation of the International Chamber Music Festival of Stavanger . MÃ rk holds a Professorship at the Norwegian Academy of Music , Oslo . MÃ rk plays a rare Domenico Montagnana cello ( Venice , 1723 ) , the scroll of which was made by Stradivarius . Valued at around 12 million NOK it once belonged to a Belgian gentleman who named it the `` Esquire '' . It was bought by a bank in Norway ( SR Bank ) , and is on loan to him . In April 2009 , MÃ rk experienced an infection of the central nervous system , presumably caused by a tick bite he received in the United States in 2006 , with subsequent encephalitis , and paralysis in the shoulder muscles of the left arm . In the autumn of 2009 he expressed concern that he might never be able to perform again . As of January 2011 , MÃ rk is back on stage , returning also to the studio with a recording of concertos by C. P. E. Bach .
In 2009 , the installed capacity of wind power in Germany was 25.78 GW . Wind power currently produces about seven percent of Germanyâ s total electrical power . More than 21,163 wind turbines are located in the German federal area and the country has plans to build more wind turbines . As of 2011 , Germany 's federal government is working on a new plan for increasing renewable energy commercialization , with a particular focus on offshore wind farms . As of 2009 , Wind power in Germany provides over 90,000 people with jobs and German wind energy systems are also exported . The FuhrlÃ nder Wind Turbine Laasow , built in 2006 near the village of Laasow , Brandenburg , is the tallest wind turbine in the world . However , the economics of wind power in Germany are under close scrutiny and there are other issues which deserve consideration . These include the effect of wind turbines on the landscape , the effect on the bird population , and the effect on the tourist industry . Repowering , the replacement of first-generation wind turbines with modern multi-megawatt machines , is occurring in Germany . Modern turbines make better use of available wind energy and so more wind power can come from the same area of land . Modern turbines also offer much better grid integration since they use a connection method similar to conventional power plants . Offshore wind energy also has great potential in Germany . Wind speed at sea is 70 to 100 % higher than onshore and much more constant . A new generation of 5 MW or larger wind turbines which are capable of making full use of the potential of wind power at sea has already been developed and prototypes are available . This makes it possible to operate offshore wind farms in a cost-effective way once the usual initial difficulties of new technologies have been overcome . On July 15 of 2009 , the first offshore German windturbine completed construction . This turbine is the first of a total of 12 wind turbines for the alpha ventus offshore wind farm in the North Sea . Following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents , Germany 's federal government is working on a new plan for increasing renewable energy commercialization , with a particular focus on offshore wind farms . Under the plan large wind turbines will be erected far away from the coastlines , where the wind blows more consistently than it does on land , and where the enormous turbines wo n't bother the inhabitants . The plan aims to decrease Germany 's dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants . In Saxony-Anhalt 47 % of electricity was produced with wind power in 2009 .
St. David 's Island is one of the main islands of Bermuda . It is located in the far north of the territory , one of the two similarly sized islands that makeup the majority of St. George 's Parish . The island was originally 503 a in size ( 2.0 square kilometres ) , but was enlarged by reclamation in 1942 to 650 acres ( 2.6 square kilometres ) to allow room for a US military base ( originally the US Army 's Fort Bell\/Kindley Field , later Kindley Air Force Base , and then USNAS Bermuda ) which occupied over half the island . The base was closed in 1995 , but much of its facilities are still used as part of Bermuda International Airport . Cooper 's Island is now attached to St. David 's in the southeast , although the two islands are still widely regarded as if they were separate entities The island was named in honor of Saint David , the patron saint of Wales , as the similarly sized St. George 's Island , to the north , had been named for the patron saint of England . The two islands are separated by two bodies of water - Ferry Reach in the south-west and St. George 's Harbor in the north-east . St. David 's is separated from the Bermudian mainland by the waters of Castle Harbor in the south , but is joined to it by road via The Causeway . Notable features of the island include St. David 's Head , Bermuda 's easternmost point , and the nearby St. David 's Battery , on Great Head ( Great Head is the more prominent of two headland which comprise St. David 's Head ) ; Bermuda International Airport ; St. David 's Lighthouse ; and Annie 's Bay on Cooper 's Island . St. David 's Island is connected to the United States by an Atlantic fiber Optic cable known as 360 Americas . As with the rest of Bermuda , the St. David 's islanders were established from a diverse group of immigrants , beginning in the 17th Century . These included indentured servants from England , Spanish-speaking Blacks from the West Indies , and Black , Native American , Irish , and Scottish slaves . The last three groups were largely composed of prisoners-of-war and others ethnically-cleansed from their homelands following English wars of conquest . Although hundreds of Native American slaves were absorbed into the population of all of Bermuda , other Bermudians have long distinguished St. David 's islanders ( disparagingly ) as ` Mohawks ' . Only two Mohawk boys were recorded as having been imported to Bermuda following Dutch-Mohawk wars , but to many English in the 17th Century , the Mohawks were the best known Native American people , and any Native American was likely to be described as a Mohawk . Today , many St. David 's islanders are proud to be called Mohawks , and are actively re-establishing links to Wampanoag , Pequot and other Algonquian nations that contributed to Bermuda 's settlement . Since the joining of the Island to the rest of Bermuda by the US Army in the 1940s , the former relative isolation of St. David 's has ended . The subsequent influx of other Bermudians to what is seen as a more affordable part of Bermuda to buy property , which increased dramatically after the closure of NAS Bermuda in 1995 , has eroded the unique character of the islands population , who were once distinguishable by accent and appearance .
As of October 2010 , the entire series is available on the Netflix Instant Streaming service . A stapler is a mechanical device that joins sheets of paper or similar material by driving a thin metal staple through the sheets and folding the ends . Staplers are widely used in government , business , offices , and schools . The first known stapler was handmade in the 18th century in France for King Louis XV . Each staple was inscribed with the insignia of the royal court , as required . The growing uses of paper in the 19th century created a demand for an efficient paper fastener . In 1866 , George McGill received U.S. patent 56,587 for a small , bendable brass paper fastener that was a precursor to the modern staple . In 1867 , he received U.S. patent 67,665 for a press to insert the fastener into paper . He showed his invention at the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , and continued to work on these and other various paper fasteners through the 1880s . In 1868 a patent was also taken out for a stapler in England by C.H. Gould . As well , also in 1868 , Albert Kletzker of St Louis , MO patented a device to staple paper . In 1877 Henry R. Heyl filed patent number 195603 for the first machines to both insert and clinch a staple in one step , and for this reason some consider him as the inventor of the modern stapler . In 1876 and 1877 Heyl also filed patents for the Novelty Paper Box Manufacturing Co of Philadelphia , PA , However , the N. P. B. Manufacturing Co. 's inventions were to be used to staple boxes and books . The first machine to hold a magazine of many preformed staples came out in 1878 . On February 18 , 1879 , George McGill received patent 212,316 for the McGill Single-Stroke Staple Press , the first commercially successful stapler . This device weighed over two and a half pounds and loaded a single 1\/2 inch wide wire staple , which it could drive through several sheets of paper . The first published use of the word `` stapler '' to indicate a machine for fastening papers with a thin metal wire was in an advertisement in the American Munsey 's Magazine in 1901 . In the early 1900s , several devices were developed and patented that punched and folded papers to attach them to each other without a metallic clip . The Clipless Stand Machine ( made in North Berwick ) sold from 1909 into the 1920s . It cut a tongue in the paper that it folded back and tucked in . Bump 's New Model Paper Fastener used a similar cutting and weaving technology . In 1941 the type of paper stapler that is the most common in use today was developed : the four way paper stapler . With the four way , the operator could either use the stapler to staple papers to wood or card board , or used to staple like pliers for bags , or the normal way with two option , one the standard with the staples going inward or turning the plate and the staples going outward . Permanent fastening binds items by driving the staple through the material and into an anvil , a small metal plate that bends the ends , usually inward . On most modern staplers , the anvil rotates or slides to change between bending the staple ends inward for permanent stapling or outward for pinning ( see below ) . Clinches can be standard , squiggled , flat , or rounded completely adjacent to the paper to facilitate neater document stacking . A staple remover is a device that removes permanent staples with a pair of interlocking curved claws that slide under the staple 's bent-over ends and bend them back out . Pinning temporarily binds documents or other items , often cloth or clothing for sewing . To pin , the anvil slides or rotates so that the staple bends outwards instead of inwards . Some staplers pin by bending one leg of the staple inwards and the other outwards . The staple binds the item with relative security , but is easily removed . Tacking fastens objects to surfaces , such as bulletin boards or walls . A stapler that can tack has a base that folds back out of the way so staples drive directly into an object rather than fold against the anvil . A dedicated tacking device , with no base or anvil , is called a staple gun . Saddle staplers have an inverted `` V '' - shaped saddle for stapling pre-fold sheets to make booklets . Stapleless staplers , invented in 1910 , are a means of stapling that punches out a small flap of paper and weaves it through a notch . Surgeons can use surgical staplers in place of sutures to close the skin , or during surgical anastomosis . A surgical stapler does n't resemble a standard stapler , as it has no anvil . Surgical staples are commonly preshaped into a `` M '' . Pressing the stapler into the skin and applying pressure onto the handle bends the staple through the skin and into the fascia , until the two ends almost meet in the middle to form a rectangle . Staplers are commonly used intra-operatively during bowel resections in colorectal surgery . Often these staplers have an integral knife which , as the staples deploy , cuts through the bowel and maintains the aseptic field .
The Shyok River flows through northern Ladakh in India and the Northern Areas of Pakistan ( Ghangche District ) , spanning some 550 k. The Shyok River , a tributary of the Indus River , originates from the Rimo Glacier , one of the tongues of Siachen Glacier . The river widens at the confluence with the Nubra River . The alignment of the Shyok river is very unusual , originating from the Rimo glacier , it flows in a southeasternly direction and joining the Pangong range , it takes a northwestern turn , flowing parallel to its previous path . The Shyok flows in a wide valley , suddenly entering a narrow gorge after Chalunka , continuing through Turtuk and Tyakshi before crossing into Pakistan . The Shyok joins the Indus at Keris , to the east of the town of Skardu . The Nubra river , originating from the Siachen glacier , also behaves like the Shyok . Before Tirit the SE flowing river Nubra takes a NW turn on meeting the river Shyok . The similarity in the courses of these two important rivers probably indicates a series of paleo fault lines trending NW-SE in delimiting the upper courses of the rivers . The importance of the Indus and the Shyok rivers is in the deposition of the thick Quaternary sediments -- a treasure trove for geology researchers . The Shyok Valley is the valley of the Shyok River situated in Ladakh . The valley is close to the Nubra Valley . Khardung La on the Ladakh Range lies north of Leh and is the gateway to the Shyok and Nubra valleys . The Siachen Glacier lies partway up the latter valley .
Art of Life is a mini album released by X Japan on August 28 , 1993 . It consists entirely of the 29 minute long title track , and was written and composed by Yoshiki Hayashi , entirely in English . The heavily orchestrated piece ( recorded with the London Philharmonic Orchestra ) is partly based on Schubert 's unfinished Symphony No. 8 and comprises several passages of varying speed and instrumentation , including numerous verses , with no set chorus , several harmonized guitar solos , and eight minutes performed solely on piano . Upon the album 's release , it debuted at number-one and became the 28th best-selling album of 1993 with over 513,000 units sold . It was rarely played live , an early performance taking place on July 30 , 1992 at the Nippon Budokan and two more on December 30 and 31 , 1993 , at the Tokyo Dome . The last two were later released on the 1998 Art of Life Live album and the 2003 Art of Life 1993.12.31 Tokyo Dome VHS\/DVD , and in 2008 both concerts were released in their entirety on the X Japan Returns 1993.12.30 and X Japan Returns 1993.12.31 DVDs . It was also performed at the band 's reunion concert on March 28 , 2008 at the Tokyo Dome , but was cut short when Yoshiki collapsed midway through the song , just before the piano solo . The rest of the song was played at the same venue two days later . It was once again played at the Tokyo Dome on May 3 , 2009 , starting from the second movement , and at the AsiaWorld-Expo in Hong Kong on January 16th ( first movement ) and 17th ( second movement ) , 2009 . The second movement was played as the last song at every night of their `` North American Tour 2010 '' . The song opens with very gentle guitar fading in , with piano following soon after . The strings of the orchestra enter at 25 seconds , softly at first but gradually building in volume until Toshi 's first vocals . With one drum beat Yoshiki 's piano is now traded for drums ( as he would do live during this song and others ) . Two guitars enter immediately following that hit , playing the same solo only with one playing it several steps higher to create harmony . At 3:34 the tempo is sped up with a third guitar coming in to play the heavier riff that drives this , and similar , sections of the song . Vocals and the orchestra re-enter as the band continues , and at certain moment , there are some spoken words . Following this is another harmonized guitar solo . With the conclusion of the second spoken word , there is an interlude where all guitar , drums , and most of the orchestra , with the exception of a harpsichord and several cellos , drop out . A single chord effectively ends the interlude , and a flurry of drums brings the song back into a powerful state . This is followed by another harmonized guitar solo ; however , this one differs from the others thus far as it is significantly longer and very staccato in nature . The tone of the band and orchestra has shifted as well into a section layered beneath Toshi 's vocals . Upon completion of this verse , there is a slow guitar solo that flows into a violin solo . The tone of the violin shifts and there is another spoken word verse . There is another explosive note and flurry of drums , identical to earlier , during the closing lines of the verse that brings the song back around to another powerful tone . Toshi 's voice then fades out with his last note along with the band and entire orchestra . The next nine minutes are performed solely on piano . It starts out as a soft , simple riff that builds up and dies back down several times . A second piano is added , and there is a clash of notes as the first continues to play the same riff and the second has bursts of madness . Eventually , the string section joins , and the chaos dwindles away to the soft riff , and that too fades out as the strings replace the piano completely . A guitar dive dismisses the strings and brings the faster tempo , Toshi 's vocals and band back in , and the band drives the song on to the finish .
Robinson Sucroe ( also known as Robinson SucroÃ `` in French ) is a 1994 animated series . It was created by France Animation in France and Cinar ( now known as Cookie Jar Entertainment ) in Canada , illegally plagiarized from Claude Robinson 's work Les aventures de Robinson CuriositÃ . The show was a loose adaption of Robinson Crusoe set with a Looney Tunes twist . It first aired in France 2 in France , BBC in the U.K. , and Teletoon in Canada . It originally aired on the Cookie Jar Toons block on This TV in the United States from 2008 to 2009 . In 2009 , Quebec Superior Court Justice Claude Auclair , in a 240-page decision , awarded Claude Robinson $ 5.2 million in damages and total vindication in his case . In the 1990s , Cinar , now renamed Cookie Jar Entertainment , plagiarized the work Robinson had previously unsuccessfully presented to them in the 1980s . The company appealed the decision .
Attempts to join the Arabic version without dots might appear without two dots underneath : . Thee Michelle Gun Elephant ( often abbreviated to TMGE ) was a Japanese garage rock band . The band was formed in 1991 while the members were students at Tokyo 's Meiji Gakuin University . They later drew influence from The Roosters . Their unusual name originated when a friend mispronounced the title of an early jam session recording ; featuring cover songs of Thee Headcoats and from The Damned 's album , Machine Gun Etiquette . The band announced that they would break up on October 11 , 2003 , after their Last Heaven tour of Japan . On July 22 , 2009 , guitarist Abe Futoshi died of an acute hematoma . The majority of the band 's songs have English titles , which often appear to be a random selection of words cobbled together - ` Pinhead Cranberry Dance ' , for example . The lyrics are almost entirely Japanese , with the odd English phrase or word thrown in . All four members have had other musical projects or played with other bands both while in TMGE and after its break-up . Some of these are as follows :
Sally Beamish ( born 26 August 1956 , London ) is a British composer of chamber , vocal , choral and orchestral music . Beamish studied the viola at the Royal Northern College of Music , where she received lessons from Anthony Gilbert and Lennox Berkeley . She later studied in Germany with the Italian violinist Bruno Giuranna . As a violist in the Raphael Ensemble , she recorded four discs of string sextets . However , it was as a composer that she made her mark , particularly after moving from London to Scotland . She has written a large amount of music for orchestra , including two symphonies and several concertos ( for violin , viola , cello , oboe , saxophone , trumpet , percussion , flute and accordion ) . She has also written chamber and instrumental music , film scores , theater music , and music for amateurs . In September 1993 Beamish received the Paul Hamlyn Foundation Award for outstanding achievement in composition . In 1994 and 1995 she co-hosted the Scottish Chamber Orchestra ( SCO ) composers ' course in Hoy with Sir Peter Maxwell Davies . From 1998 to 2002 she was composer in residence with the Swedish Chamber Orchestra and the SCO , for whom she wrote four major works . Beamish won a ` Creative Scotland ' Award from the Scottish Arts Council which enabled her to write her oratorio for the 2001 BBC Proms - the Knotgrass elegy premiered by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus with Sir Andrew Davis . Future projects include concertos for the RaschÃ r Saxophone Quartet , cellist Robert Cohen ( Minnesota Orchestra\/Osmo VÃ nskÃ ) and percussionist Colin Currie . She has a series of recordings on the BIS label . She lives in Callander , Perthshire , in Scotland and has three children .
Cadmium fluoride ( CdF2 ) is a mostly water-insoluble source of cadmium used in oxygen-sensitive applications , such as the production of metallic alloys . In extremely low concentrations ( ppm ) , this and other fluoride compounds are used in limited medical treatment protocols . Fluoride compounds also have significant uses in synthetic organic chemistry . Cadmium fluoride is prepared by the reaction of gaseous fluorine or hydrogen fluoride with cadmium metal or its salts , such as the chloride , oxide , or sulfate . It may also be obtained by dissolving cadmium carbonate in 40 % hydrofluoric acid solution , evaporating the solution and drying in a vacuum at 150 Â C. Another method of preparing it is to mix cadmium chloride and ammonium fluoride solutions , followed by crystallization . The insoluble cadmium fluoride is filtered from solution . Cadmium fluoride , like all cadmium compounds , is toxic and should be used with care . Fluoride is mildly toxic by comparison .
A seminary , theological college , or divinity school is an institution of higher education for educating students ( sometimes called seminarians ) in theology , generally to prepare them for ordination as clergy or for other ministry . The English word is taken from the Latin seminarium , translated as seed-bed , the image from the Council of Trent document Cum Adolescentium Aetas which called for the first modern seminaries . As such , in the West the term usually refers to Christian educational institutes , but has widened to include American Jewish institutions . The establishment of modern seminaries resulted from Roman Catholic reforms of the Counter-Reformation after the Council of Trent . The Tridentine seminaries placed great emphasis on personal discipline as well as the teaching of philosophy as a preparation for theology ; an approach that was explicitly rejected by Protestant reformers such as John Calvin . Some seminaries elect to acquire accreditation . In North America , four entities that accredit religious schools in particular are recognized by the United States Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation : Association of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools , Association for Biblical Higher Education , Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada , and Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools . The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sponsors religious education programs for secondary school students which are referred to as seminaries . In general use , a seminary can be a secular institution , or part of an institution , designated for specialized training , e.g. a graduate course . This use is not well attested after the nineteenth century . In some countries , the term seminary is also used for secular schools of higher education that train teachers . During the 19th century in the United States , `` Seminaries educated women for the only socially acceptable occupation : teaching . Only unmarried women could be teachers . Many early women 's colleges began as female seminaries and were responsible for producing an important corps of educators . ''

Shaeed Baba 's grave is in Mollah Taous Khani Although it is known that Panini ( c. 450 - 350 BCE ) was born in Shalatula , a small town near Attock on the northwestern Indian peninsula in what is now Pakistan , historians remain uncertain as to the exact dates of Panini 's birth and death . One theory , supported by internal references that indicate Panini had contact with or was at least aware of Greek civilization , place his life after the year 327 BCE , when Macedonian Alexander the Great reached northwestern India . However , historical evidence supports limited contact between the two civilizations as early as the sixth century BCE .

The Minnesota River is a tributary of the Mississippi River , approximately 332 miles ( 534 km ) long , in the U.S. state of Minnesota . It drains a watershed of nearly 17,000 square miles ( 44,000 km2 ) , 14,751 square miles ( 38,205 km2 ) in Minnesota and about 2,000 sq mi ( 5180 km2 ) in South Dakota and Iowa . It rises in southwestern Minnesota , in Big Stone Lake on the Minnesotaâ `` South Dakota border just south of the Laurentian Divide at the Traverse Gap portage . It flows southeast to Mankato , then turns northeast . It joins the Mississippi south of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul , near the historic Fort Snelling . The valley is one of several distinct regions of Minnesota . Of Lakota language origin , the name Minnesota means `` sky-tinted water or cloudy-sky water '' ( minne = water and sota = sky-tinted or cloudy sky ) and refers to the milky-brown color its waters take on when at flood stage . An illustration of the meaning of these words was shown by dropping a little milk into water . For over a century prior to the organization of the Minnesota Territory in 1849 , the name St. Pierre ( St. Peter ) had been generally applied to the river by French and English explorers and writers . On June 19 , 1852 , acting upon a request from the Minnesota territorial legislature , the United States Congress decreed the aboriginal name for the river , Minnesota , to be the riverâ s official name and ordered all agencies of the federal government to use that name when referencing it . The valley that the Minnesota River flows in is up to five miles ( 8 km ) wide and 250 feet ( 80 m ) deep . It was carved into the landscape by the massive glacial River Warren between 11,700 and 9,400 years ago at the end of the last ice age in North America . Pierre-Charles Le Sueur was the first European to visit the river . The Minnesota Territory , and later the state , were named for the river . The river valley is notable as the origin and center of the canning industry in Minnesota . In 1903 Carson Nesbit Cosgrove , an entrepreneur in Le Sueur presided at the organizational meeting of the Minnesota Valley Canning Company ( later renamed Green Giant ) . By 1930 , the Minnesota River valley had emerged as one of the country 's largest producers of sweet corn . Green Giant had five canneries in Minnesota in addition to the original facility in Le Sueur . Cosgrove 's son , Edward , and grandson , Robert also served as heads of the company over the ensuing decades before the company was swallowed by General Mills . Several docks for barges exist along the river . Dried goods are transported to the ports of Minneapolis and Saint Paul , and then shipped down the Mississippi River .
Year 39 ( XXXIX ) was a common year starting on Thursday ( link will display the full calendar ) of the Julian calendar . At the time , it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Augustus and Corbulo ( or , less frequently , year 792 Ab urbe condita ) . The denomination 39 for this year has been used since the early medieval period , when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years .
Norbury is a town in the London Borough of Croydon , also crossing the London Borough of Merton . It shares the postcode London SW16 with nearby Streatham . Norbury is 6.7 m south of Charing Cross . The name derives from North Burh , ( North Borough ) . Some local histories note that this was due to Norbury 's position on the northern boundary of the former Manor of Croydon . In actual fact it takes it name from a split in the borough of Bensham , one of the former seven boroughs of Croydon . ` Northbenchesham ' became the Northborough , then Norbury . ` Southbenchesham ' later became Thornton Heath . Norbury , like Streatham and Croydon , lies on the London to Brighton Way Roman road , the northern part of which has become the A23 road . At Hepworth Road the intact road , 32 feet wide , was excavated in 1961 . Remnants of a metalled ford across the stream were found further south at Hermitage Bridge on the River Graveney which forms part of the boundary between Norbury and Streatham , before flowing on to the River Wandle , then the River Thames . Norbury was a sub-manor of Croydon Manor and was held by the Carew family between 1385 and 1859 . The Carews also held Beddington . Norbury Farm was the manor house - it was demolished in 1914 . Norbury Hall , Craignish Avenue , does remain - now as a retirement home and a Grade II listed building . It was built for William Coles in 1802 . In the late 19th century , its owner was James Hobbs , local businessman and fifth Mayor of Croydon who bought the house in 1884 . A few years later , he was implicated in the Liberator Building Society scandal with Jabez Balfour , convicted and imprisoned . The Hobbs family owned the Hall until 1958 when it was sold to the County Borough of Croydon ( from 1965 the London Borough of Croydon ) , with its gardens open to the public . By then most of the farms and open land belonging to Norbury Manor and Hall had been built upon . The London County Council built an estate of almost 500 homes in Norbury , one of its first ` Out-County ' estates between 1906 and 1910 . Norbury railway station opened in 1878 , although the railway line had opened in 1862 . It was rebuilt in 1902 and connects Norbury with Croydon , London Bridge and London Victoria . Although Croydon 's horse-tram network never reached Norbury , electric trams were introduced in 1901 , connecting the town all the way through to Purley . However , Croydon trams and London trams used different systems and could not use the same tracks , leading through passengers to have to change in Norbury . This was finally rectified in 1925 . The trams were removed after World War II but there are now plans to extend Tramlink from Croydon to Streatham via Norbury . Though considered to belong to the London Borough of Croydon about one third of the town ( from Stanford way ) crosses over to the London Borough of Merton . Norbury is portrayed in a Sherlock Holmes short story , `` The Adventure of the Yellow Face '' , as one of the few places in which the detective turned out to be wrong regarding his theories .

The history of this debate reaches at least as far back as Plato , and evidence of it is found in many cultures ( see Overview of the Rule of Law ) . Sean Charles Watkins ( born February 18 , 1977 ) is a guitarist , vocalist , and songwriter . He is a member of the contemporary folk band Nickel Creek , the duo Fiction Family and the supergroup Works Progress Administration . Sean Watkins began his tenure with Nickel Creek playing mandolin , but later switched to guitar . The band has released three albums and a CD composed of their hits ( called Reasons Why : The Very Best ) and won a Grammy for This Side -- a coveted trophy that Watkins reportedly put on top of his toilet at home . Explaining the somewhat odd situation , Watkins said that `` it seems like a humble place . I did n't want to put it out in plain view of my house . I did n't feel like displaying it right when you walk in . It 's a nice crown for the porcelain . '' In addition to playing with Nickel Creek , Watkins has released 3 solo albums and appeared on several others . Of this experience , Watkins has said , `` I 've learned now to look back to music that has lasted through the years and to appreciate the timeless value that it has . '' As a solo musician , his early material was contemporary bluegrass , but he has since incorporated other influences into his music ( especially indie rock ) . Watkins ' solo music career seems to reflect Nickel Creek 's : turning from traditional bluegrass songs to indie rock with bluegrass instrumentation . He is the oldest member of Nickel Creek . Sean qualified for the National Flatpicking Championship in 1993 at age 16 , and `` My first instrument was the piano when I was six '' , Sean recalled . `` I took classic instruction for seven years , but three years into that I discovered bluegrass music , through my piano teacher 's son , who had a bluegrass band that played every Saturday night at a pizza place in Carlsbad . I really got into it , and when Sara Watkins and I met Chris ( Thile ) , we started playing with him on Saturday nights too . '' His sister Sara Watkins , also a member of Nickel Creek , plays violin and sings background vocals on the two latest of his three solo albums . In 2004 , Nickel Creek participated in a project dubbed Mutual Admiration Society , a collaboration with former Toad The Wet Sprocket singer Glen Phillips . Sean and Sara are also part of the 2007 soundtrack for the psychological thriller Bug with the track `` No Way to Live '' . In 2006 , Sean and Switchfoot member Jon Foreman started a collaborating duo called `` The Real SeanJon '' . In March 2008 , the duo announced that the had changed their band name to `` Fiction Family '' . In a spring 2008 interview , Jon Foreman said that the album would have a summer 2008 release and the duo was considering having the album be distributed by Starbucks . However , a September 2008 press release by Nickel Creek confirmed that the album , Fiction Family , is to be released on January 20 , 2009 , on ATO Records . In January 2008 , it was reported by Billboard that a new supergroup octet tentatively named The Scrolls had formed , now known officially as Works Progress Administration ( W.P.A. ) . The octet is composed of Watkins , his sister Sara Watkins ( fiddle ) , Glen Phillips ( guitar , vocals ) , Benmont Tench ( piano ) , Luke Bulla ( fiddle ) , Greg Leisz ( various ) , Pete Thomas ( drums ) , and Davey Faragher ( bass ) . The group will release their debut album on September 15 , 2009 . In addition , Watkins plans to release what he calls `` 15 minutes of noise '' as a digital download on his website .
Vladimir Aleksandrovich Teplyakov ( November 6 , 1925 â `` December 10 , 2009 ) was a Russian physicist best known for his work on particle accelerators . He , working with I.M. Kapchinsky , invented the principle of the radio frequency quadrupole ( RFQ ) , which revolutionized the acceleration of low energy ion beams . V.A. Teplyakov was born in Tambov , Russian SFSR , USSR , on November 6 , 1925 . He was drafted into the Red Army in January 1943 to fight in the Second World War , serving as part of the 3rd Ukrainian Front , and participated in the Vienna Offensive . After the war , he graduated from the All-Union Correspondence Polytechnic Institute in Moscow and got a job at the Institute of Chemical Physics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences . From 1959 to 1966 he worked at Chelyabinsk-70 , where he studied high-current proton linear accelerators . In 1966 , he and his colleagues were transferred to the Institute of High Energy Physics in Protvino , where he was in charge of the I-100 , a 100 MeV Alvarez drift-tube linac , which was an injector to the U-70 synchrotron , a 70 GeV proton synchrotron , the world 's largest particle accelerator at that time . In 1969 , while working at IHEP , Teplyakov and Kapchinsky developed the concept of the radio frequency quadrupole . This concept creates a `` double gap '' using an intermediate electrode , creating separate accelerating and focusing parts . This allows for the dimensions of drift tubes to decrease and switch to small cavities , which are more cost-effective at low ion velocities . Teplyakov subsequently developed several RFQ drift-tube structures and RF cavities to drive them . For the rest of his life , Teplyakov continued to work at IHEP , continuing his work on particle accelerators . Teplyakov eventually became Deputy Director of Science at IHEP . He died on December 10 , 2009 in Protvino . He is the author of more than 100 scientific papers and inventions , and is the co-author of the book Linear Accelerators of Ions . Teplyakov and Kapchinsky were awarded the Lenin Prize in 1988 for the development of the RFQ . For his work in the field of physics , Teplyakov also received the Order of Lenin and the Order of the October Revolution . During World War II , Teplyakov was awarded the Order of Glory , 3rd class , the Order of the Patriotic War , 2nd class , the Medal of Valour , and the medal for the Capture of Vienna . In 2006 , The European Physical Society Accelerator Group awarded him the prize `` for outstanding work in the accelerator field with no age limit '' . Teplyakov was one of the first to receive the title `` Veteran of Atomic Energy and Industry '' and also received the title `` Honored Worker of Science and Technology '' .

According to Allmusic reviewer James Christopher Monger , who gave the album three out of five stars , Life Starts Now continues the theme of One-X , Gontier 's personal demons , but with a `` hint of sunlight '' . He compliments the album , saying it `` treats the well-worn metal themes of anger , isolation , heartache , and redemption with the kind of begrudging respect they deserve , pumping out a competent flurry of fist-bump anthems and world-weary , midtempo rockers '' . Harsher negative reviews came from Ben Czajkowski from 411mania . com as he described the album as `` Boring , bland , trite , tired , tried , and true are all words that I would use to describe Life Starts Now , the latest from Three Days Grace '' . Jeremy Bentham gave the album a positive review , saying you can tell things have changed , especially when you hear Bitter Taste . Tunelab Music gave the album 9 out of 10 .

The provinces of Iran further subdivided into counties called shahrestan , an area inside an ostan , and consists of a city center , few bakhsh and many villages around them . There are usually a few cities and rural agglomerations in each county . Rural agglomerations are a collection of a number of villages . One of the cities of the county is appointed as the capital of the county . The world Shahrestan comes from the Persian language words : shahr and ostan which means city ( or town ) and province respectively . The nearest equivalent of Shahrestan in English would be sub-province or county . Each Shahrestan has a governmental office known as Farmandari which coordinates different events and governmental offices . The Farmandar , or the head of Farmandari , is the governor of the Shahrestan which is the highest governmental authority in the division . Among provinces of Iran , Fars has the highest number of Shahrestans , with 23 , while Semnan and South Khorasan have only 4 Shahrestans each ; Qom uniquely has one , being coextensive with its namesake county . Iran had 324 Shahrestans in 2005 . To better understand such subdivisions , the following table may be helpful . Assume that province P is divided into two counties : A and B. County A has 3 districts : Central , X , and Y. The Central district is the district that contains City M , the capital of the county . Each district might contain one or more cities and\/or one or more RAs ( rural agglomerations ) . In our example , the Central district contains City M , City N , and RA T composed of the villages V1 , V2 , V3 , and V4 , in turn ; district X contains City O and RA U ; and district Y has no cities and one RA V. The minimal county consists of only one city as the only district , named Central , of course . The county B in the following table is of such type , containing only one city Q.
The polonaise ( , chodzony ; ) is a slow dance of Polish origin , in 3\/4 time . Its name is French for `` Polish . '' The notation alla polacca on a score indicates that the piece should be played with the rhythm and character of a polonaise ( e.g. , the rondo in Beethoven 's Triple Concerto op . 56 has this instruction ) . The polonaise had a rhythm quite close to that of the Swedish semiquaver or sixteenth-note polska , and the two dances have a common origin . FrÃ dÃ ric Chopin 's polonaises are generally the best known of all polonaises in classical music . Other classical composers who wrote polonaises or pieces in polonaise rhythm included Johann Sebastian Bach , Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , MichaÅ Kleofas OgiÅ ski , Franz Schubert , Carl Maria von Weber , Robert Schumann , Franz Liszt , Moritz Moszkowski , Friedrich Baumfelder , Mauro Giuliani , Modest Mussorgsky , Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and Alexander Scriabin . Polonaise is a widespread dance in carnival parties . There is also a German song , called `` PolonÃ se Blankenese '' from Gottlieb Wendehals alias Werner BÃ hm , which is often played on carnival festivals in Germany about this dance . Polonaise is always a first dance at a studniÃ wka ( `` hundred-days '' ) , the Polish equivalent of the senior prom , which is approximately 100 days before exams . John Philip Sousa , who wrote the Presidential Polonaise , intended to keep visitors moving briskly through the White House receiving line . Sousa wrote it in 1886 at the request of President Chester A. Arthur who died before it was performed .

The term blues scale is used to describe a few scales with differing numbers of pitches and related characteristics . The hexatonic , or six note , blues scale consists of the minor pentatonic scale plus the 4th or 5th degree . A major feature of the blues scale is the use of blue notes , however , since blue notes are considered alternative inflections , a blues scale may be considered to not fit the traditional definition of a scale . At its most basic , a single version of this `` blues scale '' is commonly used over all changes ( or chords ) in a twelve bar blues progression . Likewise , in contemporary jazz theory , its use is commonly based upon the key rather than the individual chord . The heptatonic , or seven note , conception of the `` blues scale '' is as a diatonic scale ( a major scale ) with lowered third , fifth , and seventh degrees and blues practice is derived from the `` conjunction of ` African scales ' and the diatonic western scales '' . Steven Smith argues that , `` to assign blue notes to a ` blues scale ' is a momentous mistake , then , after all , unless we alter the meaning of ` scale ' . Despite this , an essentially nine note blues scale is defined by Benward and Saker as a chromatic variation of the major scale featuring a flat third and seventh degrees which , `` alternating with the normal third and seventh scale degrees are used to create the blues inflection . These ` blue notes ' represent the influence of African scales on this music . '' The triad chord of a blues scale is the suspended chord .

The University of Bologna ( , UNIBO ) is the oldest continually operating university in the world , the word ` universitas ' being first used by this institution at its foundation . The true date of its founding is uncertain , but believed by most accounts to have been 1088 . Since 2000 , the University 's motto has been Alma mater studiorum ( Latin for `` fostering mother of studies '' ) . The university received a charter from Frederick I Barbarossa in 1158 , but in the 19th century , a committee of historians led by GiosuÃ Carducci traced the founding of the University back to 1088 , making it the oldest university in the strict sense in the world . The university is historically notable for its teaching of canon and civil law . Until modern times , the only degree granted at that university was the doctorate . The University counts about 100,000 students in its 23 faculties . It has branch centers in Reggio Emilia , Imola , Ravenna , ForlÃ , Cesena and Rimini and a branch center abroad in Buenos Aires . Moreover , it has a school of excellence named Collegio Superiore di Bologna . Higher education processes are being harmonised across the European Community . Nowadays the University offers 128 different `` Laurea '' or `` Laurea breve '' first-level degrees ( three years of courses ) , followed by a similar number of `` Laurea specialistica '' specialised degrees ( two years ) . However , some courses have maintained preceding rules of `` Laurea specialistica europea '' or `` Laurea magistrale '' , with only one cycle of study of five years , except for medicine which requires six years of courses . After the `` Laurea '' one may attain 1st level Master . After `` Laurea specialistica '' and `` Laurea specialistica europea '' are attained , one may proceed to 2nd level Master , specialisation schools , or doctorates of research . In the early 1950s , some students of the University of Bologna were among the founders of the review `` il Mulino '' . On April 25 , 1951 , the first issue of the review was published in Bologna . In a short time , `` il Mulino '' became one of the most interesting reference points in Italy for the political and cultural debate , and established important editorial relationships in Italy and abroad . Editorial activities evolved along with the review . In 1954 , the il Mulino publishing house ( SocietÃ editrice il Mulino ) was founded , which today represents one of the most relevant Italian publishers . In addition to this were initiated research projects ( focusing mostly on the educational institutions and the political system in Italy ) , that eventually led , in 1964 , to the establishment of the Istituto Carlo Cattaneo . In 2010 QS World University Rankings ranked the University of Bologna 176th in the world . On the 2009 THEâ `` QS World University Rankings list ( in 2010 Times Higher Education World University Rankings and QS World University Rankings parted ways to produce separate rankings ) , the University of Bologna was ranked inside the top 200 for the third consecutive year .

Leuconostoc is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria , placed within the family of Leuconostocaceae . They are generally ovoid cocci often forming chains . Leuconostoc sp . are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin and are catalase-negative ( which distinguishes them from staphylococci ) . All species within this genus are heterofermentative and are able to produce dextran from sucrose . They are generally slime-forming . Blamed for causing the ` stink ' when creating a sourdough starter , some species are also capable of causing human infection . Because they are an uncommon cause of disease in humans , standard commercial identification kits are often unable to identify the organism . Leuconostoc is , along with other lactic acid bacteria such as Pediococcus and Lactobacillus responsible for the fermentation of cabbage , making it Sauerkraut . In this process the sugars in fresh cabbage are transformed to lactic acids which give it a sour flavor and good keeping qualities .

Schinus is a genus of flowering trees and tall shrubs in the sumac family , Anacardiaceae . Members of the genus are commonly known as pepper trees . The Peruvian Pepper Tree ( Schinus molle ) is the source of the spice known as pink peppercorns but can become serious invasive species outside their natural habitats . Schinus polygama , although less well known , is also potentially weedy in some areas . The generic name is derived from the Greek word for Pistacia lentiscus , Î # Ï Î Î 1\/2 Î Ï ( schinos ) , which it resembles . Over time there has been a fair amount of reclassification within this genus and earlier names may incorrectly continue to be used by those unaware of changes , including in some cases government departments and even textbooks . The name Schinus areira remains widespread , in Australia ( the Peppercorn tree ) in particular , but is now considered to be a sub-species of Schinus molle ( var . areira ) .

Ulrich â Uliâ HoeneÃ ( born 5 January 1952 ) is a former German footballer , who played as a forward . During his career , he is mainly associated with Bayern Munich , later also serving as the club 's general manager and president . HoeneÃ was born in Ulm , Baden-W Ã 1\/4 rttemberg . The left-sided forward was recruited from amateurs TSG Ulm 1846 by Udo Lattek , then manager of Bundesliga giants FC Bayern Munich , at the age of 18 . The player immediately made an impact , scoring six times in 31 matches as the Bavarians finished in second position , behind Borussia MÃ nchengladbach , and adding the domestic cup . During his eight 1\/2-year stint with Bayern , HoeneÃ enjoyed great success , winning a total of eight accolades , including three league titles and as many European Cups ; in the 1973 â `` 74 edition of the latter competition , in the final replay against AtlÃ tico Madrid , he gave one of his most outstanding performances ever , contributing with two goals to the 4 â `` 0 victory , in efficient counter-attacking moves . However , in the final of the European Cup , against Leeds United , he suffered a knee injury from which he never fully recovered . In late 1978 , HoeneÃ was loaned to Bayern neighbors 1 . FC Nuremberg , where it was hoped he could get more match practice . His recovery , however , failed , and he was forced to hang up his boots , at only 27 ; he appeared in 250 matches in Germany 's top division , netting 86 times . Immediately after retiring , HoeneÃ was appointed commercial\/general manager of Bayern Munich , overseeing a period in which the club had continued sporting success , winning the Intercontinental Cup , the UEFA Champions League , the UEFA Cup , 15 German leagues and seven domestic cups ( before his arrival , the club had won a mere seven major trophies in its history ) . During his reign , the club also experienced strong growth : revenue increased approximately by twentyfold and membership of the club increased tenfold to over 100,000 , making Bayern the second largest membership based football club in the world . Between 2000 â `` 05 , Bayern also built a state of the art stadium , the Allianz Arena at a cost of â 340m , which was also one of the venues during the 2006 World Cup . HoeneÃ played 35 times for the West Germany . His debut came on March 29 , 1972 , as he scored the final 2 â `` 0 in a friendly win in Hungary . As one of six Bayern players in the German squad , HoeneÃ won both UEFA Euro 1972 and the 1974 FIFA World Cup . In the final of the latter , against Holland , he committed a foul on Johann Cruyff in the opening minutes that led to a goal from the subsequent penalty , but the hosts came from behind to win it 2 â `` 1 ; additionally , he also played with the national side in Euro 1976 in Yugoslavia , where he missed the decisive attempt in the penalty shootout loss against Czechoslovakia , skying it over the crossbar . Despite his success , HoeneÃ retained his amateur status until 1972 , allowing him to take part in that year 's Summer Olympic Games . There , he played alongside future Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld , amongst others , as West Germany failed to qualify for the semifinals of the tournament , losing 2 â `` 3 defeat at the hands of East Germany , with HoeneÃ scoring his only goal of the tournament ; this historic match was also the first between the two Germanies . HoeneÃ has no memory of the accident . It is said that this â miraculousâ survival changed his life and he became a more compassionate person , who has since helped many Bayern players through bad times , including Gerd MÃ 1\/4 ller .

PÃ r Fabian Lagerkvist ( 23 May 1891 â '' 11 July 1974 ) was a Swedish author who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1951 . Lagerkvist wrote poems , plays , novels , stories , and essays of considerable expressive power and influence from his early 20s to his late 70s . Among his central themes was the fundamental question of good and evil , which he examined through such figures as the man who was freed instead of Jesus , Barabbas , and the wandering Jew Ahasuerus . As a moralist , he used religious motifs and figures from the Christian tradition without following the doctrines of the church . Lagerkvist was born in VÃ xjÃ ( SmÃ land ) . Lagerkvist received a traditional religious education - he would say , with little exaggeration , that he `` had had the good fortune to grow up in a home where the only books known were the Bible and the Book of Hymns '' . In his teens he broke away from Christian beliefs , but unlike many other writers and thinkers in his generation he did not become vehemently critical of religious beliefs as such . Though he was politically a socialist for most of his life , he never indulged in the idea that `` religion is the opium of the people '' . Much of his writing is informed by a lifelong interest in man and his symbols and gods and in the position of Man ( both as individual and mankind ) in a world where the Divine is no longer present , no longer speaking . In his early years Lagerkvist supported modernist and aesthetically radical views , as shown by his manifesto Ordkonst och bildkonst ( word art and picture art ) ( 1913 ) and the plays Den SvÃ ra Stunden ( `` The Difficult Hour '' ) . One of the author 's earliest works is Ã ngest ( Anguish , 1916 ) , a violent and disillusioned collection of poems . His anguish was derived from his fear of death , the World War , and personal crisis . He tried to explore how a person can find a meaningful life in a world where a war can kill millions for very little reason . `` Anguish , anguish is my heritage \/ the wound of my throat \/ the cry of my heart in the world . '' ( `` Anguish '' , 1916 . ) `` Love is nothing . Anguish is everything \/ the anguish of living . '' ( `` Love is nothing '' , 1916 . ) This pessimism , however , slowly faded , as testified by his subsequent works , Det eviga leendet ( The Eternal Smile , 1920 ) , the autobiographical novel GÃ st hos verkligheten ( Guest of Reality , 1925 ) and the prose monologue Det besegrade livet ( The defeated Life , 1927 ) , in which the faith in man is predominant . From The Eternal Smile on , his style largely abandoned the expressionist pathos and brusque effects of his early works and there was a strong striving for simplicity , classical precision and clean telling , sometimes appearing close to naivism . The content , however , was never truly naive . A Swedish critic remarked that `` Lagerkvist and John the Evangelist are two masters at expressing profound things with a highly restricted choice of words '' . Ten years after Ã ngest , Lagerkvist married for the second time , a union which was to provide a pillar of safety in his life until the death of his wife forty years later . HjÃ rtats sÃ nger ( Songs of the Heart ) ( 1926 ) appeared at this time , bearing witness to his pride and love for his consort . . This collection is much less desperate in its tone than Ã ngest , and establlished him as one of the foremost Swedish poets of his generation . His prose novella BÃ deln ( `` The Hangman '' , 1933 ) , later adapted for the stage , ( The Hangman , 1933 ; play , 1934 ) shows his growing concern with the totalitarianism and brutality that began to sweep across Europe in the years prior to World War II . Nazism was one of the main butts of the work and Der StÃ 1\/4 rmer responded with a very dismissive review . Criticism against Fascism is also present in the play Mannen utan sjÃ l ( The Man Without a Soul , 1936 ) . Lagerkvist 's 1944 novel DvÃ rgen ( The Dwarf ) , a searching , ironic tale about evil , was the first to bring him positive international attention outside of the Nordic countries . The work was followed in 1949 by the unusual , lyrical play LÃ t mÃ nniskan leva ( Let Man Live ) . Barabbas ( 1950 ) , which was immediately hailed as a masterpiece ( by , among others , fellow Nobel laureate AndrÃ Gide ) is probably Lagerkvist 's most famous work . The novel is based on a Biblical story . Jesus of Nazareth was sentenced to die by the Roman authorities immediately before the Jewish Passover , when it was customary for the Romans to release someone convicted of a capital offense . When the Roman procurator Pontius Pilate offers to free Jesus or Barabbas , a convicted thief and murderer , a Jerusalem mob demands the release of Barabbas , who spends the rest of his life trying to come to terms with why he was chosen to live . The novel was filmed in 1962 , with Anthony Quinn playing the title role . Lagerkvist died in Stockholm .

A shabono ( also xapono , shapono , or yano ) is a hut used by the Yanomami Amerindians of extreme southern Venezuela and extreme northern Brazil . Used as temporary dwellings , they are traditionally constructed mainly of thatched palm leaves and wood . Shabonos are built in clearings in the jungle , using the wood cleared to build a palisade with a thatched roof that has a hole in the middle . In traditional Yanomami villages , multiple shabonos , each conical or rectangular in shape , surround a central open space . Each family unit has its own area within a given shabono .
Terminology is the study of terms and their use . Terms are words and compound words that are used in specific contexts . Not to be confused with `` terms '' in colloquial usages , the shortened form of technical terms ( or terms of art ) which are defined within a discipline or speciality field . The discipline Terminology studies among other things how such terms of art come to be and their interrelationships within a culture . Terminology therefore denotes a more formal discipline which systematically studies the labeling or designating of concepts particular to one or more subject fields or domains of human activity , through research and analysis of terms in context , for the purpose of documenting and promoting correct usage . This study can be limited to one language or can cover more than one language at the same time ( multilingual terminology , bilingual terminology , and so forth ) or may focus on studies of terms across fields . Terminology is not connected to information retrieval in any way but focused on the meaning and conveyance of concepts . `` Terms '' ( i.e. index terms ) used in an information retrieval context are not the same as `` terms '' used in the context of terminology , as they are not always technical terms of art . Ad hoc terminology is prevalent in the translation profession , where a translation for a specific term ( or group of terms ) is required quickly to solve a particular translation problem . As a discipline , terminology is related to translation , alongside which it is often taught in universities and translation schools . Large translation departments and translation bureaus will often have a terminology section , or will require translators to do terminology research . Terminology is also defined by context , the study of terms primarily concerned with organizing them by the context in which they are used . These contexts may include :
Thallium ( III ) oxide is a chemical compound of thallium and oxygen . It occurs in nature as the rare mineral avicennite . Its structure is related to that of Mn2O3 which has a bixbyite like structure . Tl2O3 is metallic with high conductivity and is a degenerate n-type semiconductor which may have potential use in solar cells . A method of producing Tl2O3 by MOCVD is known . Any practical use of thallium ( III ) oxide will always have to take account of thallium 's poisonous nature . Contact with moisture and acids may form poisonous thallium compounds .
Yosa Buson or Yosa no Buson was a Japanese poet and painter from the Edo period . Along with Matsuo BashÅ and Kobayashi Issa , Buson is considered among the greatest poets of the Edo Period . Buson was born in the village of Kema in Settsu Province ( now Kema-ch Å , Miyakojima Ward in the city Osaka ) . His original family name was Taniguchi . Around the age of 20 , Buson moved to Edo ( now Tokyo ) and learned poetry under the tutelage of the haikai master Hayano Hajin . After Hajin died , Buson moved to ShimÅ sa Province ( modern day Ibaraki Prefecture ) . Following in the footsteps of his idol , Matsuo BashÅ , Buson traveled through the wilds of northern HonshÅ `` that had been the inspiration for BashÅ 's famous travel diary , Oku no Hosomichi ( The Narrow Road to the Interior ) . He published his notes from the trip in 1744 , marking the first time he published under the name Buson . After traveling through various parts of Japan , including Tango ( the northern part of modern Kyoto Prefecture ) and Sanuki ( Kagawa Prefecture in Shikoku ) , Buson settled down in the city of Kyoto at the age of 42 . It is around this time that he began to write under the name of Yosa . There is speculation that he took this name from his mother 's birthplace ( Yosa in the province of Tango ) but this has not been confirmed . Buson married at the age of 45 and had one daughter , Kuno . From this point on , Buson remained in Kyoto , writing and teaching poetry at the Sumiya . In 1770 , he assumed the haigo ( haikai pen name ) of Yahantei ( å å ä , Midnight Studio ) , which had been the pen name of his teacher Hayano Hajin . Buson died at the age of 68 and was buried at Konpuku-ji in Kyoto .
WWE Extreme Rules is a professional wrestling event produced annually by World Wrestling Entertainment , a Connecticutâ `` based promotion , and broadcast live and available only through pay-per-view ( PPV ) .

The flag of the state of Arizona consists of 13 rays of red and weld-yellow on the top half , the colors of the flag of Spain , representing the 13 original states . The red and yellow also symbolize Arizona 's picturesque sunsets . There is a copper-colored star in the center , representing Arizona 's copper-mining industry . The rest of the flag is colored blue , representing liberty . In 1910 , Colonel Charles W. Harris , head of the Arizona National Guard , designed a flag for the Arizona Rifle Team when they attended the National Matches at Camp Perry . Arizona had been the only team in past matches to compete without a flag . The flag was adopted on February 17 , 1917 , by the third state legislature . It was passed into law without the signature of Governor Thomas Campbell . The governor did not officially state his reasons for taking no action on the bill . In a 2001 poll conducted by the North American Vexillological Association , the Arizona flag was identified as one of the `` 10 best flags on the continent , '' ranking sixth out of 72 North American flags for overall design quality . To properly make the state flag , the height of the flag is two units high while the width is three units wide . The sun rays at the top are divided into thirteen equal segments , starting with red and alternating with gold until the thirteen rays are complete . In the center of the flag , the copper star will be one unit high , while the rest of the flag is covered by blue section measuring one unit high and three units wide . The colors of red and blue are the same shade that is used on the flag of the United States . The specific colors of copper and gold have not been set down in law . The suggested flag size is four by six feet , with the star being two feet tall .

Rainer Bonhof ( born 29 March 1952 in Emmerich am Rhein , North Rhine-Westphalia ) is a former German footballer . He was a defensive midfielder or wing-back . Bonhof , a midfielder , was part of the highly successful Borussia MÃ nchengladbach side of the 1970s winning numerous Bundesliga , German Cup and UEFA Cup titles . He was widely recognized for having one of the game 's hardest free-kicks as well as long and precise throw-ins . Former Liverpool goalkeeper , Ray Clemence , in 1977 following a European Cup tie between the Reds and Borussia MÃ nchengladbach , admitted he feared Bonhof 's shots and apparently with good reason . During the spring of 1978 Clemence was beaten twice by Bonhof from nearly identical locations at the club and international level respectively . Bonhof was awarded the ARD Goal of the Month on three occasions , twice for free-kicks and once for a 30 metre strike . Bonhof became ( at that time ) Germany 's youngest World Champion on 7 July 1974 following his team 's 2 â `` 1 win over the Netherlands in Munich 's Olympiastadion at the 1974 FIFA World Cup . Bonhof assisted Gerd MÃ 1\/4 ller 's winning goal . He was a fixture in the West German national team from the World Cup onward . He was one of the best players in the 1976 European Championship , assisting four of the six West German goals in the semi-final and final . He played in every match of the 1978 FIFA World Cup when West Germany was eliminated in the second round following a 2 â `` 3 defeat at the hands of their historic rivals Austria . He continued to play an important role in the national team following his transfer to Valencia . His move and that of Uli Stielike prompted the DFB to remove their ban on selecting foreign based players for the national team . He played a role in qualifying for the 1980 European Championships and was selected for the squad but injuries kept him from making an appearance during the West German victory . His last appearance for the national team came in a 1 â `` 4 defeat at the hands of Brazil , and in spite of a strong Bundesliga campaign for 1 . FC KÃ ln in 1981 â `` 82 he was not selected to return to the national team . His playing career was abruptly ended by an ankle joint injury in 1983 . Bonhof went on to coach . He received his formal license in 1988 , and has coached several teams , resigning a year early from his Scotland U21 responsibilities after they finished last in their European U21 Championship Qualifying group , after 14 games and no victories . On 1 September 2006 , Bonhof signed a contract with recent FA Premier League winners Chelsea to become their scout for the scopes of Germany and Austria . The contract was a rolling deal , allowing either Chelsea and Bonhof to break it up any time . The deal between Chelsea F.C. and Bonhof ended because of the club 's high debts . Bonhof left London on 31 October 2008 . On 11 February 2009 he was named as the new vice president of Borussia MÃ nchengladbach .
Kosei Kitauchi ( born 25 April 1974 ) is a former Japanese football player .
The 1976 Summer Olympics , officially known as the Games of the XXI Olympiad , were an international multi-sport event celebrated in Montreal , Quebec , Canada , in 1976 . Montreal was awarded the rights to the 1976 Games on May 12 , 1970 , at the 69th IOC Session in Amsterdam , over the bids of Moscow and Los Angeles , which later hosted the 1980 and 1984 Summer Olympic Games respectively . These were the first Olympic Games held in Canada , preceding the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary and 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver . One blank vote was cast in the second and final round . One factor favoring Montreal was that the IOC did not want the Summer games hosted in a superpower for fears of political backlash , which would be proven later on in the Olympic boycotts of 1980 and 1984 . Robert Bourassa , then the Premier of Quebec , first pushed Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to advise Canada 's monarch , Queen Elizabeth II , to attend the opening of the games . However , Bourassa later became unsettled about how unpopular the move might be with sovereigntists in the province , annoying Trudeau , who had already made arrangements . The leader of the Parti QuÃ bÃ cois at the time , RenÃ LÃ vesque , sent his own letter to Buckingham Palace , asking the Queen to refuse her prime minister 's request , though she did not oblige the premier as he was out of his jurisdiction in offering advice to the sovereign . These are the top ten nations that won medals at these Games . Host country of Canada placed 27th with 11 medals total . Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of athletes from each nation that competed at the Games . The following 28 countries boycotted the Games . The boycott was due to the refusal of the IOC to ban New Zealand , after New Zealand 's national rugby union team had toured South Africa earlier in 1976 . South Africa had been banned from the Olympics since 1964 due to its apartheid policies . Zaire did not compete , but claimed financial causes rather than political . Both the Republic of China and the People 's Republic of China boycotted the games over issues concerning the legitimacy of each other . In November 1976 , the International Olympic Committee recognized the People 's Republic of China as the sole legal representative . In 1979 , the IOC began referring to the Republic of China as Chinese Taipei as a result of the Nagoya Resolution ; this led to the Republic of China boycotting the 1980 Summer Olympics outside of the US-led boycott that year . The Olympics were a financial disaster for Montreal , as the city faced debts for 30 years after the Games had finished . The Quebec provincial government took over construction when it became evident in 1975 that work had fallen far behind schedule ; work was still under way just weeks before the opening date , and the tower was not built . Mayor Jean Drapeau had confidently predicted in 1970 that `` the Olympics can no more have a deficit than a man can have a baby '' , but the debt racked up to a billion dollars that the Quebec government mandated the city pay in full . This would prompt cartoonist Aislin to draw a pregnant Drapeau on the telephone saying , `` Allo , Morgentaler ? '' in reference to a Montreal abortionist . The Olympic Stadium was designed by French architect Roger Taillibert . It is often nicknamed The Big O as a reference to both its name and to the doughnut-shape of the permanent component of the stadium 's roof , though The Big Owe has been used to reference the astronomical cost of the stadium and the 1976 Olympics as a whole . It has never had an effective retractable roof , and the tower was completed only after the Olympics . In December 2006 the stadium 's costs were finally paid in full . The total expenditure ( including repairs , renovations , construction , interest , and inflation ) amounted to C$ 1.61 billion . Today , despite its huge cost , the stadium is devoid of a major tenant , after the Montreal Expos moved in 2005 . The boycott by African nations over the inclusion of New Zealand , whose rugby team had played in South Africa that year , was a contributing factor in the massive protests and civil disobedience that occurred during the 1981 Springbok Tour of New Zealand . Official sporting contacts between South Africa and New Zealand did not occur again until after the fall of apartheid . Australia 's failure to win a gold medal led the country to create the Australian Institute of Sport .

According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 3.2 square miles ( 8.4 kmÂ ) , all of it land . The Cherokee name for Jay is Dlaygvi ( Bluejay Place ) . Jay is atypical in Oklahoma history because the townsite and layout were located and platted specifically for its purpose as a county seat . It is not located on a river , major road or railway line as were most Oklahoma towns of the late 1800s and early 1900s . Around 1908 , the Delaware County Improvement Association hired a survey team to pinpoint the exact location of the center of the county . They pinpointed allotment land belonging to Thomas Oochaleta , a full-blood Cherokee . Since acquiring title to a full-blood 's allotment would require a lengthy federal legal procedure , the committee shifted their attention to the allotment adjoining Oochaleta 's on the east , a parcel belonging to committee member Claude L. `` Jay '' Washbourne . As a mixed-blood Cherokee , Washbourne was exempt from the federal policy restricting the sale or transfer of his land . He gave ten acres on which to construct a town . The town was designed , reserving a central block for a courthouse . The committee quickly constructed a frame building and then applied to the U.S. Postal Service for a post office , submitting the required three town names for consideration . The names submitted were `` Center , '' `` Jay , '' and `` Washbourne . '' Postal authorities chose Jay for its brevity As of the census of 2000 , there were 2,482 people , 954 households , and 609 families residing in the city .

The median age was 34 years . For every 100 females , there were 87.7 males . For every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 82.0 males . The median income for a household in the city was $ 21,875 , and the median income for a family was $ 25,592 . Males had a median income of $ 20,212 versus $ 17,039 for females . The per capita income for the city was $ 10,700 . About 21.4 % of families and 25.9 % of the population were below the poverty line , including 35.1 % of those under age 18 and 22.3 % of those age 65 or over . Jay was named for Jay Washburn , a nephew of Stand Watie and grandson of an early-day Cherokee missionary . The town is the county seat of Delaware County , having won that distinction from Grove , Oklahoma in a special county seat election on December 8 , 1908 . The 1910 -- 11 Legislature made Grove a County Court Town , and provided for two court terms each year . On June 27 , 1911 , the Supreme Court of Oklahoma ruled in favor of Jay , and on January 5 , 1912 , the County Commissioners ordered the records to be moved to Jay . On May 10 , 1913 the courthouse in Jay was burned , destroying most of the county records . The post office was established May 19 , 1909 .

In Norse mythology , MÃ Ã i ( anglicized MÃ di or Mothi ) and Magni are the sons of Thor . Their names mean `` Angry '' and `` Strong , '' respectively . Rudolf Simek states that , along with Thor 's daughter Ã rÃ Ã r ( `` Strength '' ) , they embody their father 's features . MÃ Ã i and Magni 's descent from Thor is attested by the kennings `` MÃ Ã i 's father '' ( faÃ ir MÃ Ã a , in HymiskviÃ a , 34 ) and `` Magni 's father '' ( faÃ ir Magna , in Ã Ã rsdrÃ pa and HÃ rbarÃ sljÃ Ã , 53 ) . Snorri Sturluson confirms it ( Gylfaginning , 53 , SkÃ ldskaparmÃ l , 4 ) . According to SkÃ ldskaparmÃ l ( 17 ) Magni is the son of Thor and the JÃ tunn JÃ rnsaxa . There is no mention of MÃ Ã i 's mother . But the hammer MjÃ llnir struck Hrungnir in the middle of the head , and smashed his skull into small crumbs , and he fell forward upon Thor , so that his foot lay over Thor 's neck . ThjÃ lfi struck at MÃ kkurkÃ lfi , and he fell with little glory . Thereupon ThjÃ lfi went over to Thor and would have lifted Hrungnir 's foot off him , but could not find sufficient strength . Straightway all the Ã sir came up , when they , learned that Thor was fallen , and would have lifted the foot from off him , and could do nothing . Then Magni came up , son of Thor and JÃ rnsaxa : he was then three nights old ; he cast the foot of Hrungnir off Thor , and spake : ` See how ill it is , father , that I came so late : I had struck this giant dead with my fist , methinks , if I had met with him . ' Thor arose and welcomed his son , saying that he should surely become great ; ` And I will give thee , he said , the horse Gold-Mane , which Hrungnir possessed . ' Then Odin spake and said that Thor did wrong to give the good horse to the son of a giantess , and not to his father . : â '' SkÃ ldskaparmÃ l ( 17 ) , Brodeur 's translation John Lindow draws a parallel between Magni and Odin 's son VÃ li for they both have a giantess mother ( Rindr for VÃ li ) and achieve a feat at a very young age ( VÃ li is only one day old when he kills HÃ Ã r , thus avenging Baldr 's death ) .

Barbie Horse Adventures : Wild Horse Rescue is a video game available for PlayStation 2 , Game Boy Advance and Xbox , based on the Barbie line of dolls by Mattel . A storm comes in and causes the gate at a ranch to open , letting horses and foals run away . Barbie must track down the foals and horses through 3 parts of 3 different settings : the forest , the mountains , and the beach . There is an average of three foals plus one horse that can be found at the end of the section . In the 2nd part of the section , a missing horse will be found by someone else , and Barbie must race them . The game has been heavily criticized by the gaming press . X-Play dubbed it a Game You Should Never Buy next to Monster Garage : The Game and Big Rigs : Over the Road Racing . In the episode , X-Play co-host Morgan Webb called Barbie Horse Adventures : Wild Horse Rescue the worst game ever made , and continues to reference it so in ongoing episodes after giving the terrible review of having a 1 out of 5 . IGN gave it a 4\/10 rating , and XGP Gaming rating it a 4 out of 10 . Decent reviews , which mainly point out that the game was being geared towards children , were given out by TeamXbox ( 3.8 \/ 5 ) and the British Official Xbox Magazine ( 6.7 \/ 10 . ) The Xbox version ( and by extension , Xbox creator Microsoft ) has been ridiculed for being a rare game that is forward-compatible to the Xbox 360 , while some of the more popular Xbox games remain unplayable on the newer console . It is viewed as a minor licensed title which has little appeal outside of its niche market . However , it 's been reported that the forwards compatibility of the game on the Xbox 360 was a side effect of emulation of a different game . A sequel to Wild Horse Rescue was released on October 26 , 2008 . It was titled `` Barbie Horse Adventures : Riding Camp '' .

Lord Brocktree is a fantasy novel by Brian Jacques , published in 2000 . It is the thirteenth book in the Redwall series to be published . It is also the earliest chronological installment in the Redwall series . The book focuses on a badger , Lord Brocktree , and haremaid Dotti as they journey towards Salamandastron , the mountain fortress of badger lords , to recapture it from the wildcat Ungatt Trunn . This book revolves around the badger Lord Brocktree , father of Boar the Fighter , grandfather of Bella of Brockhall , and great-grandfather of Sunflash the Mace . He sets out to find the ancient badger mountain stronghold of Salamandastron , aided by the quick talking haremaid Dorothea Duckfontein Dillworthy and otter Ruffgar Brookback . Meanwhile , in Salamandastron , trouble comes for Brocktree 's father , Lord Stonepaw . Years of peace have left the mountain stronghold with few fighters , and those that remain are long past their prime , including Stonepaw himself . The wildcat Ungatt Trunn , son of Mortspear , Highland King of the North , lays siege to the fortress with his Blue Hordes . Eventually the mountain is overrun , leading to the deaths of many hares and even of Stonepaw himself , who dies valiantly defending his hares , taking many vermin with him as he does . The wildcat takes at least sixty hares as prisoners , but through the efforts of warrior Stiffener Medick and his otter friend Brogalaw , they escape . Lord Brocktree gets an army from Bucko Bigbones , after Dotti defeats him in a contest . Thanks to the Bark Crew , the group of guerrillas formed by Stiffener and Brogalaw to harass Trunn , the Blue Hordes are slowly starved , their supplies cut off . Ungatt Trunn tricks the Bark Crew into putting up a last stand in battle , but Lord Brocktree joins forces with the hares and saves the day . The book culminates in a massive final battle , with many memorable characters killed , such as Jukka the Sling , a female squirrel chieftain , and Fleetscut the hare . Eventually , when the battle ends up a near-stalemate , Trunn and Brocktree face off in a duel . After a failed assassination attempt on Brocktree by the searat Doomeye and the corsair fleet captain Karangool ( Trunn 's second in command ) the badger eventually wins , snapping Trunn 's spine and leaving him on the sand to die . Trunn is thrown into the water but survives , only to be drowned by Groddil , one of his former advisors .
A balloon loop or turning loop allows a rail vehicle or train to reverse direction without having to shunt or even stop . Balloon loops can be useful for passenger trains and unit freight trains , such as coal trains . Turning loops are also common on tram or streetcar systems . Many , although by no means all , streetcar and tram systems use single ended vehicles that have doors on only one side and that must be turned at each end of the route . Balloon loops were first introduced on metro and tram lines . They did not appear on freight railways in large numbers until the 1960s when the modernizing British Rail introduced merry-go-round ( MGR ) coal trains that operated from mines to power stations and back again without shunting . Balloon loops are essential for operating single-ended trams . Balloon loops were also used by steam trams in Sydney , though the loops were mostly removed when double-ended electric trams came into use . the station is located on the balloon loop , and the platform may be curved or straight . The balloon loop is past the station . Balloon loops are used extensively on tramway systems with single-ended trams . Usually located at termini , the loop may be a single one-way track round a block . Single-ended trams have a cab at only one end and doors on one side , making them cheaper and having more space for passengers . On tram systems with double-ended trams balloon loops are not required . The Milan interurban tramway network , although using double-ended trams , had balloon loops at termini within the city limits so that they could be used as backup termini by the single directional trams used on urban service . In Milan , tramway depots are built as balloon loops , just as urban termini . Another example is in Potsdam , Germany . There are several balloon loops at power stations in the UK ; these have been provided so that coal trains may unload without stopping ( known as the merry-go-round system ) . Examples include Cottam , Didcot , Drax , Eggborough , Ferrybridge , and Ratcliffe-on-Soar . Also , the Fife Circle line between Edinburgh and the county of Fife acts like a giant balloon loop , branching off after Inverkeithing and connecting again at Kirkcaldy . Both the French and the British terminals of the Eurotunnel Shuttle service through the Channel Tunnel consist of balloon loops . Occasionally , balloon loops are used for reversing trains on lines with heavy grades and tight curves to equalise wear on both sides of locomotives and rollingstock . Such a balloon loop was constructed at Beech Forest on the 2 ' 6 '' ( 762 mm ) Victorian Railways line from Colac to Crowes . The major disadvantage is that a balloon loop is very space consuming . Another disadvantage is that the sharp curves cause noise , as well as wear and tear on wheels and rails . Also , if the platform is located on the curve , the gap between the platform and railcar door is a hazard . The former South Ferry station on the New York City Subway solved this problem by using gap fillers that extended out to the railcar door when the train triggered a switch on the tracks . The station has since been closed . On systems where , for reasons of economy , the couplings are made non-reversible ( e.g. by fitting the air brake pipe along one side of the car only ) , the use of a reversing loop will cause a proportion of the rolling stock to face the `` wrong '' way and it may not be possible to assemble a complete train in a depot , even if sufficient cars are on hand . This was the case on the Charing Cross , Euston and Hampstead Railway ( now part of the Northern line of London Underground ) . After the opening of a loop at Charing Cross ( Embankment ) in 1914 ( replaced in 1926 by the present Kennington loop ) car ends were marked `` A '' or `` B '' ( later , when axles were designated by letters , the `` B '' car ends became `` D '' to match the adjacent axle ) , and it was not permitted to couple cars together if the ends to be coupled bore the same letter . It was found necessary to provide a turntable at Golders Green depot ( near the other end of the line ) , for use when there was an imbalance of car directions . To avoid this problem , on many systems with a balloon loop , the couplings and brake hoses are made reversible . At coal ports such as Kooragang Island the space inside the balloon loops is used for storage of coal , so that is it not wasted space . At the Olympic Park station in Sydney , the platforms are indeed straight .

Vahan Hovhannesi Totovents ( ; September 1 1889 - July 17 1937 ) was an Armenian writer , poet and public activist . Vahan Totovents was born in Kharpert ( modern Turkey ) . He studied in Armenia and Istanbul , then at Wisconsin University which he finished in 1915 . He was a volunteer in Caucasian front during World War I , and served as the bodyguarder , translator and secretary of General Andranik Ozanian , about whom he wrote memoires and published them in 1920 . In Tbilisi Totovents edited `` Hayastan '' paper , the official organ of Andranik . Since 1922 he lived in Yerevan , Soviet Armenia . In 1937 he became a victim of Stalinism . A prolific and multi-faceted writer , Vahan Totovents ( 1889-1937 ) produced with equal facility poems in prose and verse , short stories , novellas , novels , critical and biographical works , comedies , dramas , translations from Shakespeare , and a widely read and admired autobiographical work titled Life on the Old Roman Road . Writes Rouben Zarian in his reminiscences of Totovents : `` He wrote fast . He had no trouble finding the right word . His sentences flowed with ease . He did n't try to achieve perfection , only spontaneity . He had something to say and he said it . He was never idle . A born writer and a reporter by training , he never waited for inspiration . And since his urge to write came from deep within and was irresistible , sentences and paragraphs followed one another with phenomenal speed . '' Totovents was born in Mezre , a small town on the Euphrates in the province of Kharpert , where he studied under such masters of Armenian prose as Telgadinstsi and Rouben Zartarian . In his youth he traveled extensively in the Middle East , Europe , and the United States . After graduating from the University of Wisconsin , he fought as a volunteer in the Caucasus during World War I. `` I wanted to see my country liberated , '' he writes in his autobiographical sketch . `` I saw instead its total destruction , and torrents of my countrymen 's blood . I saw human suffering of such depth that there can be nothing deeper in this world . I saw nights gorged with blood . I saw men crazed by hunger ; I saw bloodthirsty mobs attacking innocent men , women , and children , and I heard the howls of their terrified victims . '' Another two years ( 1920-22 ) of wandering followed - Istanbul , Paris , New York , whence he returned to Yerevan and where , in addition to over a dozen books , he published countless essays and articles in newspapers and periodicals . Criticized for failing to produce works with `` proletarian '' content , Totovents refused to conform and was eventually arrested and exiled to Siberia . Very little is known about his last years . Sarepig Manoogian , his official biographer , simply informs us that Totovents `` died at the height of his creative powers leaving behind many unfinished projects ... '' The works of Totovents were published from 1907 . He is the author of Doctor Burbonian ( 1918 ) , Death battalion ( 1923 ) , New York ( 1927 ) , Baku ( v. 1-3 , 1930-34 ) , Jonathan , Son of Jeremiah novels , stories and dramas . He influenced to Armenian literature especially by his Life on the Old Roman Road autobiographical novel ( 1930 , A piece of sky film by Henrik Malian ) which `` reflect the society , culture , and mores not only of the Armenians of his childhood but also of their neighbors in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire '' .
British Rail Class ES1 ( Electric Shunting 1 ) was a class of two electric locomotives commissioned by the North Eastern Railway in 1902 . They were of steeplecab design . Both locomotives passed to the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923 and then to British Railways in 1948 , but both were withdrawn before TOPS . The North Eastern Railway was an enthusiastic and relatively early adopter of electric traction for railways . As part of a 1902 scheme to electrify the suburban railway networks in the Tyneside area , the NER 's Chief Mechanical Engineer , Wilson Worsdell , also wished to electrify a 3\/4 mile , horseshoe-shaped freight line that went from Trafalgar Yard in Manors to Newcastle Quayside Yard . Passing through three tunnels , this line had gradients as steep as 1:27 and a number of sharp curves : it presented a formidable challenge for steam traction . Working conditions inside the tunnels were atrocious because the locomotives had to work exceptionally hard to manage the gradients which meant they produced vast quantities of choking fumes that could not disperse from the tunnels ; the sparks they produced were a constant fire risk to the flammable packing materials in the yards . Electrification was the obvious answer . The specification for new electric locomotives demanded that they be able to start a train of 150 tons on the steepest gradient , while on the level they were expected to be able to haul 300 tons at 14 mph . The end-to-end journey on the branch was to be completed in 4.5 minutes . The steeplecab electric locomotive was developed in the USA , and in 1900 General Electric and Thomson-Houston designed and built a locomotive of this type for the Milan-Varese railway in Italy , electrified at 650v DC using the 3rd rail system . That railway opened in 1901 , and the locomotive design proved successful . The North Eastern Railway 's ES1s were derived from that American design , although they were designed from the start for both 3rd rail and overhead operation : the Newcastle Quay branch used both systemsâ '' 3rd rail in the tunnels , and overhead lines on the rest of the line . A contract was signed with the British Thomson-Houston company on 15 December 1902 , for delivery by the end of the following year . British Thomson-Houston sub-contracted the mechanical parts to Brush Electrical Engineering Co. The electrified line was operational from 5 June 1905 and in the following year both locomotives performed exceptionally well . In 1906 they were fitted with electric heaters , the men having complained they were too cold on a wintry mornings . A few years later the bow pantographs originally fitted on their bonnets were removed , and a pantograph installed on the roof instead . With few other changes they remained in operation until the line was de-electrified and they were replaced with diesel locomotives on 29 February 1964 . The line was closed five years later . Early photographs show the locomotives with `` CLASS ELECTRIC 1 '' painted on the bufferbeams , but this does not appear in official records . In common with other LNER electric locomotives , no classification was given to these locomotives until 4 October 1945 , when nos. 1 & 2 were classified ES1 ( Electric Shunting 1 ) . No. 1 exchanged numbers with class D3 steam locomotive no. 4075 on 30 September 1944 , but after the steam locomotive was again renumbered ( to no. 2000 ) , the electric locomotive was able to resume its original number on 24 October 1944 . On 14 June 1946 , nos. 1 & 2 were renumbered to 6480\/1 ; and under British Railways , they became nos. 26500\/1 in April 1948 . From 1968 ES1 ( number 26500 under British Rail 's number scheme ) was transferred to Leciester Railway Museum . After that closed , in 1977 it was taken into the National Collection of the National Railway Museum , and is currently on display at Locomotion , Shildon .
Field Marshal is a military officer rank . Today , it is the highest rank in the armies in which it is used , one step above a general or colonel-general . The origin of the rank of field marshal dates to the early Middle Ages , originally meaning the keeper of the king 's horses ( from Old German Marh-scalc = `` horse-servant '' ) , from the time of the early Frankish kings . Some nations use the title of marshal instead , while some have used field marshal general . The Air Force equivalent in the Commonwealth and many Middle Eastern air forces is marshal of the air force ( not to be confused with air marshal ) . The corresponding naval ranks are normally fleet admiral , grand admiral or admiral of the fleet . Traditionally , upon their promotion , field marshals are awarded a decorative baton as a symbol of their rank . The baton is often studded with jewels and inlaid with precious metals . In many countries like Austria-Hungary , Prussia and Germany , extraordinary military achievement by a general ( a wartime victory ) is required for a field marshal . Historically , however , several armies used field marshal as a divisional command rank , notably Spain and Mexico ( Spanish : mariscal de campo ) . In France , Portugal and Brazil ( French : marÃ chal de camp , Portuguese marechal de campo ) it was formerly a brigade command rank . Arthur Wellesley , 1st Duke of Wellington , was a field marshal in twelve armies . His twelve field marshal batons are on display in Apsley House . During Imperial rule in China , successful generals were given the title of field marshal ( å å Yuan Shuai ) or grand field marshal ( å å å da yuan shuai ) . One of the most famous of these generals was Yue Fei from the Song Dynasty . Field Marshall Mohamed Hussein Tantawi , Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has been the de facto head of state of Egypt since former president Hosni Mubarak 's resignation caused by 2011 Egyptian revolution . In the French army of the Ancien RÃ gime , the normal brigade command rank was field marshal ( marÃ chal de camp ) . In 1793 , during the French Revolution , the rank of field marshal was replaced by the rank of brigade general . The rank insignia of field marshal was two stars ( one star being used for a senior colonel rank ) . The French field marshal rank was below lieutenant-general , which in 1793 became divisional-general . In the title marÃ chal de camp and the English `` field marshal '' , there is an etymological confusion in the French camp between the English words `` camp '' and `` field '' . The French rank of field marshal should not be confused with the rank of Marshal of France , which was the highest rank of the Ancien RÃ gime and is in effect the highest French rank today ( although in theory it is not an actual rank but a `` state dignity '' ) . Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw was the 8th chief of staff of the Indian Army in 1969 and under his command , Indian forces concluded a victorious campaign during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 . Sam Manekshaw was the first of only two Indian military officers to hold the highest rank of Field Marshal in the Indian Army the other being Field Marshal Kodandera Madappa Cariappa . Until the end of World War II , Japan also bestowed the honorary title of field marshal ( å å gensui ) on successful generals and admirals ; they would however retain their ranks of general and admiral . Field marshal Muhammad Ayub Khan has remained the only field marshal in the Pakistan army till date . He appointed himself as a field marshal when he was the second president of Pakistan , as well as the commander in chief of the army . In the Turkish Armed Forces , the corresponding rank is MareÅ al . . The rank of MareÅ al can trace its origins to the Ottoman Empire and to the military of Persia , where it was called '' Ù Ø Ù Ø '' ( mÃ 1\/4 Å ir ) and bestowed upon senior commanders upon order of the ruling Sultan . The rank of MareÅ al can only be bestowed by the National Assembly , and only given to a General who leads an army , navy and\/or air force successfully in three battles or at various front lines at the same time , gaining a victory over the enemy . Only two persons have been bestowed the rank MareÅ al to date : Kemal AtatÃ 1\/4 rk , the founder of modern Turkey , and his Chief of Staff Fevzi Ã akmak , both for their successes in the Turkish War of Independence . The United States has never used the rank of field marshal ; however , General Douglas MacArthur was field marshal of the Philippine Army from August 24 , 1936 until December 31 , 1937 . On December 16 , 1944 , George Marshall became the first American general to be promoted to 5-star rank , the newly created General of the Army . A Washington columnist suggested ( with tongue in cheek ) that Marshall disliked the plan because five stars was the rank of field marshal and the Chief of Staff could then be addressed as â Marshal Marshall . â
Philip Collier ( 21 April 1873 â `` 18 October 1948 ) was Premier of Western Australia for nine years , the longest ever term for an Australian Labor Party premier . Philip Collier was born at Woodstock near Melbourne , Victoria on 21 April 1873 . The son of a farmer of the same name , he was educated locally but left school at the age of 16 . He spent some time gold mining at Steiglitz , Victoria and then in New South Wales , and was later construction foreman of the Greater Melbourne Sewage Company at Northcote . On 27 June 1900 , he married Ellen Heagney , with whom he would have two sons and two daughters . Collier began to take an interest in the labor movement , joining the Labor Party and becoming founding secretary of the Northcote branch of the Political Labor Council . He was campaign director for at least three Labor candidates in State and Federal election , including Frank Anstey . In 1904 Collier moved to Western Australia . He worked in the mines of the Perseverance Goldmining Company for around a year , becoming a member of the Boulder branch of the Amalgamated Workers ' Association , and vice-president of the Goldfields Trades and Labor Council . On 27 October 1905 , Collier was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly for the seat of Boulder . He would retain the seat until his death nearly 43 years later . He was appointed Minister for Mines and Minister for Railways in the Scaddan Ministry on 7 October 1911 , exchanging the Railways portfolio for Water Supplies on 23 November 1914 . He retained these portfolios until the defeat of the Scaddan government on 17 July 1916 . In April the following year , Scaddan resigned from the Australian Labor Party in support of Billy Hughes 's pro-conscriptionist stance , and on 9 May Collier was elected to take his place as Leader of the Labor Party and therefore Leader of the Opposition . Collier retained the leadership of the Labor party throughout the Liberal and nationalist governments of Frank Wilson , Henry Lefroy , Hal Colebatch and James Mitchell . During this time Collier joined with John Curtin and J. J. Simons in leading an anti-conscription campaign . His public comments got him in trouble with censors a number of times , and on one occasion he was fined under the War Precautions Act for making statements likely to discourage recruiting . On 17 April 1924 , the Labor party had a landslide election victory , and Collier became Premier , Treasurer and Minister for Forests . The Labor party was defeated by Mitchell in the election of 23 April 1930 , whereupon Collier resumed as Leader of the Opposition . He won another term as Premier in the election of 24 April 1933 . Simultaneously with the election , a referendum had been held in which the people of Western Australia had overwhelmingly voted in favor of secession from the Commonwealth of Australia . Although the Labor party opposed secession , Collier nonetheless agreed to act on the result of the referendum by petitioning the British government for secession . The British government 's refusal to act can be partly attributed to the fact that any action taken would have been in opposition to the new Government 's wishes . Collier resigned as premier and leader of the Labor party on 19 August 1936 , handing over to John Willcock . His 19 year term as parliamentary leader of the Australian Labor Party remains the longest ever , as does his 9 year term as Labor premier . Victor Courtney ( 1956 ) describes him as `` the only person Labor ( sic ) produced in State politics who could fairly claim to have approached statesmanship '' . Mitchell and Collier are together credited with achieving an unusual degree of friendship and cooperation between parties during the 1920s and 1930s , which was most clearly demonstrated by Collier recommending Mitchell 's appointment as Lieutenant-Governor in 1933 . Although no longer serving as a minister , Collier remained in parliament for a further twelve years , and was Father of the House from March 1939 . He died at Mount Lawley on 18 October 1948 , and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery .
The following players were in the Island Games squad in 2009 . The Emerald Coast is an area in the US state of Florida on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico , roughly bounded by Pensacola , Florida on the west and Port St. Joe , Florida on the east . It had previously been dubbed the `` Playground Area of the Gulfcoast '' from the 1940s through the 1980s , as witnessed by the name of the Fort Walton , Florida , later Fort Walton Beach , Florida ( from 1953 ) newspaper , the Playground News , later the Playground Daily News , now the Northwest Florida Daily News . Another unofficial term is the `` Redneck Riviera , '' which also is sometimes considered to stretch to Gulf Shores , Alabama . Popular vacation destinations include Pensacola Beach , Gulf Breeze , Navarre Beach , Fort Walton Beach , Niceville , WaterColor , Panama City Beach , Destin , and Seaside , a planned community whose iconic pastel-paint and tin-roof construction was made famous in the Jim Carrey movie The Truman Show , filmed in the area from 1996-1997 . Other communities on the Emerald Coast include Perdido Key , Navarre , Sandestin , Mexico Beach , Grayton Beach , Inlet Beach , Santa Rosa Beach , and Seagrove . Approximately 80 % of the Emerald Coast 's 4.5 million yearly visitors go to Destin , FL . The area is known as a family drive destination , although in the past decade , its popularity has expanded greatly , leading to new construction booms and seemingly overnight changes . Many development communities similar to Seaside have sprung up in Walton County and the west end of Panama City Beach , raising property values . Deep-sea fishing is a huge draw for the area , with Destin holding the nickname `` World 's Luckiest Fishing Village '' ( and several saltwater world records ) and Panama City Beach hosting the annual high-dollar Bay Point Billfish Invitational . The area has many seafood restaurants as well . This roughly 100-mile stretch is home to several military bases , with installations including Pensacola Naval Air Station ( home of the Navy 's Blue Angels flying squadron and the initial training site for all naval aviators ) , Hurlburt Field , Eglin Air Force Base ( one of the largest military bases in America ) , Tyndall Air Force Base ( home to the Air Force 's F-22 Raptor fighter jets ) , Coastal Systems Station-Naval Surface Warfare Center ( home to the Navy Experimental Diving Unit and Naval Diving & Salvage Training Center ) , and Corry Station Naval Technical Training Center . In addition to military and related civilian contractors , which are a major presence , tourism , fishing and hospitality industries are also major employers in the area . In addition to The Truman Show mentioned above , filming of scenes for Jaws 2 took place in the region . Interiors for the youth 's pinball hang-out were filmed in Fort Walton Beach at the now-razed original location of Hog 's Breath Saloon on Okaloosa Island , and Bruce the Shark 's control sled was placed on the bottom of the Gulf off Navarre . Redneck Riviera is also the title of a song by Tom T. Hall about this region ( from his 1996 album Songs from Sopchoppy ) .
A nostril ( or naris , pl . In birds and mammals , they contain branched bones or cartilages called turbinates , whose function is to warm air on inhalation and remove moisture on exhalation . Fish do not breathe through their noses , but they do have two small holes used for smelling which may be called nostrils . The Procellariiformes are distinguished from other birds by having tubular extensions of their nostrils . In humans , the nasal cycle is the normal ultradian cycle of each nostril 's blood vessels becoming engorged in swelling , then shrinking . The nostrils are separated by the septum . The septum can sometimes be deviated , causing one nostril to appear larger than the other . In such an event , the two nostrils are no longer separated and form a single larger external opening . Humans have two external with two additional nostrils inside the head . These internal nostrils are called `` choana '' and each contain approximately 1000 strands of nasal hair . They also connect the nose to the throat aiding in respiration . Scientists believe they migrated back inside as evidenced by the discovery of `` Kenichthys campbelli '' , a 395 million-year-old fossilized fish which shows this migration in progress . It has two nostrils between its front teeth , similar to human embryos at an early stage . If these fail to join up it causes a ` cleft palate ' . It is possible for humans to smell different olfactory inputs in the two nostrils and experience a perceptual rivalry akin to that of binocular rivalry when there are two different inputs to the two eyes .
Zuniceratops ( ` Zuni-horned face ' ) was a ceratopsian dinosaur from the mid Turonian of the Late Cretaceous Period of what is now New Mexico , United States . It lived about 10 million years earlier than the more familiar horned Ceratopsidae and provides an important window on their ancestry . Zuniceratops appears to have been roughly 3 to 3.5 meters long ( 10-11 ft ) and three feet ( one meter ) tall at the hips . It probably weighed 100 to 150 kilograms ( 200 to 250 lb ) . The frill behind its head was fenestrated but lacking epoccipitals . It is the earliest-known ceratopsian to have eyebrow horns and the oldest-known ceratopsian from North America . This set of horns is thought to have grown much larger with age . Zuniceratops was discovered in 1996 , by 8 year old Christopher James Wolfe , son of paleontologist Douglas G. Wolfe , in the Moreno Hill Formation in west-central New Mexico . One skull and the bones from several individuals have been found . More recently , one bone , believed to be a squamosal , has since been found to be an ischium of a Nothronychus . Zuniceratops is an example of the evolutionary transition between early ceratopsians and the later , larger ceratopsids that had very large horns and frills . This supports the theory that the lineage of ceratopsian dinosaurs may have been North American in origin . Although the first specimen discovered had single-rooted teeth ( unusual for ceratopsians ) , later fossils had double-rooted teeth . This is evidence that the teeth became double-rooted with age . Zuniceratops was a herbivore like other ceratopsians and was probably a herd animal as well . Zuniceratops is featured in the Discovery Channel Special , When Dinosaurs Roamed America .
Little Caesars is a pizza chain , estimated to be the 4th largest in the United States . The Little Caesars headquarters is located in the Fox Theatre building in Downtown Detroit , Michigan . Little Caesars Pizza was founded by Michael and Marian Ilitch on May 8 , 1959 . The first location was a strip mall in Garden City , Michigan , a suburb of Detroit . Mike wanted to call it simply `` Pizza Treat , '' but Marian wanted a name that suited Mike . Marian considered Mike her `` little Caesar '' . Mike ultimately relented , and the store opened as `` Little Caesar 's Pizza Treat . '' The original store is still open today . The company is famous for its advertising catchphrase , `` Pizza ! Pizza ! '' which was introduced in 1979 . The phrase refers to two pizzas being offered for the comparable price of a single pizza from competitors . Originally the pizzas were served in a single long package . In addition to pizza , they served hot dogs , chicken , shrimp , and fish . Little Caesars has discarded the unwieldy packaging in favor of typical pizza boxes . Currently , the chain is best known for its `` Hot-N-Ready '' pizzas , large pizzas with popular toppings available for immediate takeout at a low price ( $ 5.00 in most U.S. stores ) . Crazy Bread , strips of pizza dough covered in garlic spread and Parmesan cheese is also a staple item on their menu and a popular side-dish . On November 1 , 2010 , Little Caesars introduced Pizza ! Pizza ! Pantastic , denying that the return of `` Pizza ! Pizza ! '' had any relationship to the recent success of Domino 's , plus they deliver at some locations . Ilitch Holdings , Inc. provides professional and technical services to all companies owned by Mike Illich . These include the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League , Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball , Detroit 's MotorCity Casino , Blue Line Foodservice Distribution , Little Caesars Pizza Kits , Champion Foods , Olympia Entertainment , Olympia Development , Uptown Entertainment , and the Hockeytown Cafe ( also the site of City Theater ) and numerous other restaurants downtown and Fox Theatre in downtown Detroit . In 2005 , combined revenues of Ilitch-owned businesses totaled $ 2 billion . The company is looking to expand again , especially in the Northeast U.S. Currently , there are thousands of locations . In particular , Little Caesars wanted to return to markets that the chain was forced to withdraw from in the late 1990s due to financial troubles such as Pittsburgh , Minneapolis-St . Paul and Denver . In 2006 , the Little Caesars franchise returned to the Twin Cities Market , opening up stores in such busy corners as University Avenue and Snelling Avenue in Midway , Saint Paul , and Lake Street and Hiawatha Avenue , nearby the Midtown light rail station in the Phillips community of Minneapolis and other high foot traffic and or low income sections of the Twin Cities . Caesars also began a return to the competitive Pittsburgh market with the opening of new locations in Carnegie , Dormont , White Oak , West View , North Versailles , Uniontown , Canonsburg , and nearby New Castle , Pennsylvania . A new location also opened in the Pittsburgh suburb of Whitehall on 29 September 2009 , and one in Pittsburgh 's upwardly mobile Shadyside neighborhood opened May 15 , 2010 . By 1987 the company was operating across the Northern United States ; by 2006 it was also present in parts of Canada ( although some Canadian cities had locations since 1969 ) , Puerto Rico , Guam , South Korea , Honduras , Slovakia , the Dominican Republic , Czech Republic , Mexico , Turkey , Ecuador , Egypt , Aruba , Iceland , Guatemala , CuraÃ ao , Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , El Salvador , Qatar , Venezuela , UAE , Lebanon , Bahrain and Peru . In 2004 , Little Caesars began to sell Hot and Ready pizzas that are available without an order and with no wait . In 2007 , Little Caesars ended its partnership with Coca-Cola , opting for Pepsi products instead , except in Canada . Throughout the 1990s , Little Caesars was commonly found in Kmart stores . Coincidentally , the first Kmart and the first Little Caesars were both built in Garden City , Michigan . After Kmart 's bankruptcy issues , most of today 's Kmarts have replaced the Little Caesars with their own branded `` K-Cafe '' . However , some Little Caesars remain . Little Caesars pizza are also included in many remodeled Kmart locations rebanded as Sears Grand or Sears essentials . Today , Little Caesars is the fastest-growing pizza chain in the world . While Little Caesars owns the `` Pizza ! Pizza ! '' trademark in the U.S. , the unaffiliated Pizza Pizza restaurant chain owns the Canadian trademark . As a result , Little Caesars can not directly use its well-known slogan in Canada , but has used `` Two Pizzas ! '' along with `` Delivery ! Delivery ! '' , `` Quality ! Quality ! '' or other such double-word tag lines in advertising and on packaging in Canada . Little Caesars was among the first to use a new kind of speed cooking conveyor oven , the `` Rotary Air Impingement Oven '' as described in U.S. Patent 5676044 . In 1998 , Little Caesars filled what was then the current largest pizza order , filling an order of 13,386 pizzas from the VF Corporation of Greensboro , North Carolina .
Mount Erebus in Antarctica is the southernmost historically active volcano on Earth . With a summit elevation of 3794 m , it is located on Ross Island , which is also home to three inactive volcanoes , notably Mount Terror . Mount Erebus is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , which includes over 160 active volcanoes . The volcano has been observed to be continuously active since 1972 and is the site of the Mount Erebus Volcano Observatory run by the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology . Mount Erebus was discovered on January 27 , 1841 ( and observed to be in eruption ) by polar explorer Sir James Clark Ross who named it Mount Erebus after his ships , Erebus and Terror ( which were also used by Sir John Franklin on his disastrous Arctic expedition ) . Erebus was a primordial Greek god of darkness , the son of Chaos . Mount Erebus was first climbed ( to the rim ) by members of Sir Ernest Shackleton 's party in 1908 . Its first known solo ascent and the first winter ascent was accomplished by British mountaineer Roger Mear in March 1985 , a member of Robert Swan 's `` In the Footsteps of Scott '' expedition . On January 19 â `` 20 , 1991 , Charles J. Blackmer , an iron-worker for many years at McMurdo Station and the South Pole , accomplished a solo ascent in approximately seventeen hours . Mount Erebus is currently the most active volcano in Antarctica and is the current eruptive zone of the Erebus hotspot . The summit contains a persistent convecting phonolitic lava lake , one of five long-lasting lava lakes on Earth . Characteristic eruptive activity consists of Strombolian eruptions from the lava lake or from one of several subsidiary vents , all lying within the volcano 's inner crater . The volcano is scientifically remarkable in that its relatively low-level and unusually persistent eruptive activity enables long-term volcanological study of a Strombolian eruptive system very close ( hundreds of metres ) to the active vents , a characteristic shared with only a few volcanos planetarily , such as Stromboli in Italy . Scientific study of the volcano is also facilitated by their proximity to McMurdo Station ( U.S. ) and Scott Base ( N.Z. ) , both sited on Ross Island approximately thirty-five kilometres away . Mount Erebus is classified as a polygenetic stratovolcano . The bottom half of the volcano is a shield and the top half is a stratocone ( Mount Etna is like this as well ) . The composition of the current eruptive products of Erebus is anorthoclase-porphyric tephritic phonolite and phonolite , which constitute the bulk of exposed lava flow on the volcano . The oldest eruptive products consist of relatively undifferentiated and non-viscous basanitic lavas that form the low , broad platform shield of the Erebus edifice . Slightly younger basanite and phonotephrite lavas crop out on Fang Ridge â '' an eroded remnant of an early Erebus volcano â '' and at other isolated locations on the flanks of the Erebus edifice . Lava flows of more viscous phonotephrite , tephriphonolite and trachyte erupted after the basanite . The upper slopes of Mount Erebus are dominated by steeply dipping ( â ' 30 Â ) tephritic phonolite lava flows with large scale flow levees . A conspicuous break in slope at approximately 3,200 metres calls attention to a summit plateau representing a caldera less than one hundred millennia old . The summit caldera itself is filled with small volume tephritic phonolite and phonolite lava flows . In the center of the summit caldera is a small , steep-sided cone composed primarily of decomposed lava bombs and a large deposit of anorthoclase crystals known as Erebus Crystals . It is within this summit cone that the active lava lake continuously degasses . Air New Zealand Flight 901 was a scheduled passenger transport service from Auckland Airport in New Zealand to Antarctica and return , without an intermediate stop . The Air New Zealand flyover service , for the purposes of Antarctic sightseeing , was operated with McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 aircraft and began in February 1977 . The flight crashed into Mount Erebus in sector whiteout conditions on November 28 , 1979 , killing all 257 people aboard . Air New Zealand discontinued the service after the crash . During the Antarctic summer , snow melt on the flanks of Mount Erebus continually brings debris from the crash to the surface of the snow ; it is plainly visible from the air .
Take This to Your Grave is the second studio album by American rock band Fall Out Boy . It is the group 's first release under the Fueled by Ramen label and was released on May 6 , 2003 . The album title is taken from a line from the lyrics of `` The Patron Saint of Liars and Fakes '' , which reads `` Take this to your grave , and I 'll take it to mine '' . It is the first album to feature Andy Hurley . The album is certified Gold in the United States . After the initial release , a limited edition 12 '' vinyl copy of Take This To Your Grave was released . In addition to the regular album tracks , it also had a special dance remix to their hit song , `` Grand Theft Autumn '' . The vinyl was limited to one pressing of 500 copies of a green camouflage version , and one 500-copy pressing of a black vinyl version . Both versions also came with six giant trading cards . After that , it was re-released again on January 25 , 2005 as Take This to Your Grave : Director 's Cut , which included two bonus tracks as well as bonus footage . `` Dead On Arrival '' , `` Saturday '' , and `` Homesick at Space Camp '' were recorded as a demo session in two days , almost a year before going back into the studio to record seven other songs that would eventually make up the entire album . `` Grand Theft Autumn '' and `` Grenade Jumper '' were recorded in another demo session . The additional other 7 songs were recorded in 9 days with producer Sean O'keefe . In the Take This To Your Grave : Directors Cut DVD , Pete and Patrick discuss the partnership of the song writing for the album . Originally , Patrick Stump wrote the lyrics as well as the musicâ '' as witnessed in many places throughout the album . The songs `` Dead On Arrival '' , `` Grenade Jumper '' , and `` Calm Before The Storm '' were originally written by Patrick ( However , Saturday was not written by Patrick ; Pete realized the oddity of Patrick singing `` Patrick and I '' and change the lyrics accordingly ) . Pete later went back and added his own lyrics to certain parts ( e.g. changing the second verse of `` Calm Before the Storm '' ) . In interviews , Pete and Patrick often discuss how `` The Pros and Cons of Breathing '' was the first song written in the structure of how they write songs currentlyâ '' Patrick writing the music and Pete writing all the lyrics . `` Tell That Mick '' and `` The Patron Saint '' are other examples of this song writing partnership , however , Patrick Stump wrote the lyrics to the first verse and chorus of `` The Patron Saint of Liars and Fakes '' , while Pete wrote lyrics to the second verse . More so , Patrick wrote the lyrics to the chorus of `` Chicago is So Two Years Ago '' , while Pete wrote the verses .
Honey to the B is the debut album by pop singer Billie Piper , released in 1998 ( see 1998 in music ) . Billie ( she was known at the time only by her first name ) was the first and youngest British female artist to have a first single debut at # 1 on the UK pop charts . The album spawned a number of hits singles including `` Girlfriend , `` She Wants You '' , the anthemic `` Because We Want To '' , and the title track `` Honey to the Bee '' . `` Honey to the Bee '' was later covered by Swedish girl group Play for their 2003 album Replay . The American version of the album differs in that it contains the radio mix of `` Girlfriend '' . Only 1 single from the album was released in America . The Japanese version includes 2 bonus tracks . Very shortly after the album was released in Japan , her second album was released in Japan , long before it was released in the UK . 2 singles were released from the album in Japan . The single Honey To The Bee re-entered at number 17 in the official UK Singles Chart on 21 January 2007 , 8 years after initial release , thanks to efforts by BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles .
The North Pacific Giant Octopus ( Enteroctopus dofleini ) is a large cephalopod belonging to the genus Enteroctopus . It can be found in the coastal North Pacific , usually at a depth of around 65 meters ( 215 ft ) . It can , however , live in much shallower or much deeper waters . It is arguably the largest octopus species , based on a scientific record of a 71 kg ( 156.5 lb ) individual weighed live . The alternative contender is the Seven-arm Octopus based on a 61 kg ( 134 lb ) carcass estimated to have a live mass of 75 kg ( 165 lb ) . However , there are a number of questionable size records that would suggest E. dofleini is the largest of all octopus species by a considerable margin . The North Pacific Giant Octopus , or the Giant Pacific Octopus , are distinguished from other species by their sheer size . Adults usually weigh around 15 kg ( 33 lb ) , with an arm span of up to 4.3 m ( 14 ft ) . However , there are highly questionable records of specimens up to 272 kg ( 600 lb ) in weight with a 9 m ( 30 ft ) arm span . The mantle of the octopus is spherical in shape and contains most of the animal 's major organs . By contracting or expanding tiny pigment-containing granules within cells known as chromatophores in its tissue , an octopus can change the color of its skin , giving it the ability to blend in to the environment . This species of octopus commonly preys upon shrimp , crabs , scallops , abalone , clams , and fish . Food is procured with its suckers and then crushed using its tough `` beak '' of chitin . They have also been observed in captivity catching Spiny dogfish ( Squalus acanthias ) of up to 3-4 feet in length . Additionally , consumed carcasses of this same shark species have been found in Giant Pacific Octopus middens in the wild , providing strong evidence that these octopuses prey on sharks in their natural habitat . Marine mammals such as Harbor Seals , Sea Otters , and Sperm Whales depend upon the North Pacific Giant Octopus as a source of food . The octopus is also commercially fished in the United States . The North Pacific Giant Octopus is considered to be short-lived for an animal its size , with life spans that average only 3-5 years in the wild . To make up for its relatively short life span , the octopus is extremely prolific . It can lay up to 100,000 eggs which are intensively cared for by the females , who die protecting the eggs . Hatchlings are about the size of a grain of rice , and only a very few survive to adulthood . During reproduction , the male octopus deposits a spermatophore ( or sperm packet ) more than 1 meter long . Large spermatophores are characteristic of octopuses in this genus . Very little is known about the population of this solitary creature and the North Pacific Giant Octopus is not currently under the protection of CITES or evaluated in the IUCN Red List .
Lithium peroxide is the inorganic compound with the formula Li2O2 . This solid was deployed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere in the vehicles used in Apollo mission . LiOH . H2O + H2O2 â ' LiOOH . H2O + H2O 2LiOOH .

Rafael Felipe Scheidt ( born February 10 , 1976 in Porto Alegre , Brazil ) is a Brazilian footballer . He was signed by the John Barnes\/Kenny Dalglish management of Celtic from GrÃ mio for Â # 5m and failed to make an impact . Scheidt 's arrival was met with derision from opposing fans due to the amusing pronunciation of his last name . Plagued by injury and finding it hard to settle he started one game in the 1999-00 in Scottish football and was let out on loan to Corinthians by Martin O'Neill after just three appearances . The Guardian newspaper called Scheidt the second worst transfer in the history of soccer in an article published in 2001 . In 2006 Scheidt was released by Botafogo . Scheidt has three caps for Brazil .

Urich died in 2002 in Thousand Oaks , California . The actor announced in 1996 that he was suffering from synovial cell sarcoma , a rare cancer that attacks the body 's joints , for which he underwent several treatments during the last years of his life . Urich was of Rusyn and Slovak extraction and raised Roman Catholic in the small town of Toronto , Ohio , where he is honored with the Robert Urich Interchange leading to State Route 7 . Due to the similarity in names with Toronto , Ontario , many sources list him incorrectly as being a Canadian . His second wife , actress Heather Menzies , actually is a Canadian from the latter city . Urich attended Florida State University on a football scholarship . In 1968 , he earned a bachelor 's degree in Radio and Television Communications . While attending , he joined Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity . He went on to Michigan State University after working in Ohio to earn a master 's degree in Broadcast Research and Management . Urich was first married to actress Barbara Rucker ( 1968 â `` 74 ) . He married actress Heather Menzies in 1975 , and they remained married until his death in 2002 .

St. Stephan 's Cathedral , or `` Dom St. Stephan '' in German , is a baroque church from 1688 in Passau , Germany . It is the seat of the Catholic Bishop of Passau and the main church of his diocese . Since 730 , there have been many churches built on the site of the current cathedral . The current church , a baroque building around 100 m long , was built from 1668 to 1693 after a fire in 1662 destroyed its predecessor , of which only the late gothic eastern side remains . The cathedral 's overall plan was made by Carlo Lurago , its interior decoration by Giovanni Battista Carlone , and its frescos by Carpoforo Tencalla . Over time , the Passau Cathedral has acquired the largest organ outside of the United States . It is also the largest cathedral organ in the world . The organ currently has 17,774 pipes and 233 registers , all of which can be played with the five-manual general console in the gallery . The cathedral has eight large bells in the bell rooms in the north and south towers . The heaviest , `` Pummerin '' at 7550 kg cast in 1952 and `` Sturmerin '' weighing 5300 kg cast in 1733 hang in the south tower . The other six bells hang in the north tower . They include : `` Misericordia '' weighing 6000 kg , the Angelus bell , `` Predigerin '' , `` Elfuhrglocken '' , the Choir bell , and `` Dignitar '' . A ninth bell , the `` Zeichenglocke '' hangs near the sacristy door .

Interstate 182 ( I-182 ) is a 15.19 m Interstate Highway that extends from I-82 west of Richland to US 12 in Pasco . It serves the Tri-Cities . The whole length of I-182 is concurrent with US 12 , which extends westwards to Yakima , Naches , and Aberdeen and extends eastwards to Walla Walla , Lewiston , ID , Chicago , IL , and Detroit , MI . I-182 also is the only auxiliary Interstate spur of Interstate 82 . An estimated 43,000 motorists utilize the road daily in Washington . I-182 starts at an interchange with I-82 \/ US 12 west of Richland at Goose Gap . Then , the freeway , now concurrent with US 12 , goes 3 m east into Richland , where I-182 \/ US 12 become concurrent with SR 240 for one mile ( 1.6 km ) , and then SR 240 splits south into Kennewick , meanwhile I-182 \/ US 12 goes over the Columbia River on the Lee\/Volpentest Bridge into Pasco . Within Pasco , I-182 \/ US 12 passes the Broodmoor Mall and continues southeast into Downtown Pasco , where the freeway joins US 395 and passes the Columbia Basin College and Tri-Cities Airport . At an interchange with SR 397 , US 395 exits off and goes north towards Spokane and I-182 ends shortly after the interchange . From the ending of I-182 , US 12 continues onto Lewiston , Idaho . As part of Washington 's first connected state highway system , the Washington State Legislature designated the Inland Empire Highway between Ellensburg and Laurier in 1913 . The State Highway Board selected a route that would connect the main cities of Eastern Washington and the Inland Empire , which were Ellensburg , Yakima , the Tri Cities , Colfax , and Spokane . In 1923 , by which time the entire road had been improved , the highway became State Road 3 ( Primary State Highway 3 after 1937 ) , but retained its name . By that time , all of the route of Interstate 182 became a part of US 410 and US 395 , both were established in 1926 . When I-82 was approved in 1956 , the Tri-Cities wanted an Interstate , since Interstate 82 bypassed the cities . Interstate 182 was the solution and created a connection to the Tri-Cities . Legally , I-182 is defined by the Revised Code of Washington Â 47.17.372 . A project is currently awaiting funding on I-182 . In 1978 the Federal Route Log listed I-182 as having 33.42 miles .

The United States Secretary of State is the head of the United States Department of State , concerned with foreign affairs . The Secretary is a member of the Cabinet and the highest-ranking cabinet secretary both in line of succession and order of precedence . The current Secretary of State is Hillary Rodham Clinton , the 67th person , and third woman to hold the post . Most of the domestic functions of the Department of State have been transferred to other agencies . Those that remain include storage and use of the Great Seal of the United States , performance of protocol functions for the White House , and the drafting of certain proclamations . The Secretary also negotiates with the individual States over the extradition of fugitives to foreign countries . As the highest-ranking member of the cabinet , the Secretary of State is the third-highest official of the executive branch of the Federal Government of the United States , after the President and Vice President and is fourth in line to succeed the Presidency , coming after the Vice President , the Speaker of the House of Representatives , and the President pro tempore of the Senate . Six Secretaries of State have gone on to be elected President . As the head of the United States Foreign Service , the Secretary of State is responsible for management of the diplomatic service of the United States . The foreign service employs about 12,000 people domestically and internationally , and supports 265 United States diplomatic missions around the world , including ambassadors to various nations . Federal law provides that a presidential or vice-presidential resignation or refusal to accept office must be accomplished by written communication from the President to the office of the Secretary of State . When there is a vacancy in the office of Secretary of State , the duties are exercised either by another member of the cabinet , or , in more recent times , by a high-ranking official of the State Department until the President appoints , and the United States Senate confirms , a new Secretary .
Alex is a common English name , usually a nickname of the male given name Alexander , its female equivalent Alexandra , the East European male name Alexey ( Aleksei ) , or Alexis . La Tomatina is a festival that is held in the Valencian town of BuÃ ol , in which participants throw tomatoes at each other . It is held the last Wednesday in August , during the week of festivities of BuÃ ol . In 1950 , the council allowed the party to happen . The next year however it was opposed , and some participants were arrested . These people were quickly released thanks to pressure from town residents and other participants . When the festival was finally officially sanctioned , the launching of tomatoes became inventive . Methods such as using water canons , catapults and filling of fountains of rivals became common . Between the noise and chaos , participants typically primed with those who were mere spectators , including local personalities . By 1957 the festival was once again banned with strict penalties , including imprisonment , threatened against those flouting the ban . In that year , the neighborhood decided to organize what they called `` the funeral of the tomato '' , which came in a procession carrying a coffin with a great tomato , accompanied by a band playing funeral marches along the path . Due to local pressure , in 1959 the town finally approved the Tomatina , but imposed a rule that people could only throw tomatoes after a horn sounded and should end when it sounded a second time . Between 1975 and 1980 the festival was organized by the ordeal of San Luis Bertran , who supplied the tomatoes , replacing the previous arrangement of participants bringing their own . The party became popular in Spain thanks to Javier Basilio reporting the issue in the RTVE Informe Semanal in 1983 . Since 1980 the City Council provides participants with tomatoes , each year a greater tonnage than the previous year . Visitors became attracted to the event and in 2002 it was declared a Fiesta of International Tourist Interest . In 2008 a soundtrack was created , the song of the Tomatina `` Todo es del mismo color '' created by the bunyolense rock band `` Malsujeto '' . At around 10am festivities begin with the first event of the Tomatina . It is the `` palo jabÃ n '' , similar to the greasy pole . The goal is to climb a greased pole with a ham on top . As this happens , the revellers work into a frenzy of singing and dancing whilst being showered in water from hoses . Once someone is able to drop the ham off the pole , the start signal for the tomato fight is given . The signal for the onset is at about 11 when a loud shot rings out , and the chaos begins . Several trucks throw tomatoes in abundance in the Plaza del Pueblo . The tomatoes come from Extremadura , where they are less expensive and are grown specifically for the holidays , being of inferior taste . For the participants the use of goggles and gloves are recommended . The tomatoes must be crushed before being thrown so as to reduce the risk of injury . After exactly one hour , the fight ends with the firing of the second shot , announcing the end . The whole town square is colored red and rivers of tomato juice flow freely . Fire Trucks hose down the streets and participants use hoses that locals provide to remove the tomato paste from their bodies . Some participants go to the pool of â los peÃ onesâ to wash. .
Zonnebeke is a municipality located in the Belgian province of West Flanders . The municipality comprises the villages of Beselare , Geluveld , Passendale , Zandvoorde and Zonnebeke proper . On January 1 , 2006 Zonnebeke had a total population of 11,758 . The total area is 67.57 kmÂ which gives a population density of 174 inhabitants per kmÂ . The villages of Zonnebeke congregated around a large Augustinian abbey and its associated Benedictine convent in Nonnebosschen . Both were destroyed during the iconoclastic outbreak in 1580 . Only the abbey was rebuilt , but was looted during the French occupation the abbey was confiscated . Passendale played a role in the Battle of Westrozebeke in 1382 . Situated in the center of the Ypres Salient , World War I destroyed the whole area . Left abandoned until the early 1920 's , people slowly returned and rebuilt the villages . In 1932 , the locals opened a cheese making facility , which to this day is the only source of Passendale cheese . Another battle during World War Two during the Allied advance across Europe , where Passendale was used in a defensive operations by the Nazis , did little damage . Today , Zonnebeke has returned to its long-time balance between agriculture , small business and work in the neighbouring towns . Its major industry is the brickworks in the village of Zonnebeke itself , which extracts the local blue clay . The municipality comprises the villages of Zonnebeke proper , Beselare , Geluveld , Passendale and Zandvoorde . All are `` deelgemeentes '' , meaning they were independent municipalities before the merger in the 1970s .
The taxanes are diterpenes produced by the plants of the genus Taxus ( yews ) . As their name suggests , they were first derived from natural sources , but some have been synthesized artificially . Taxanes include paclitaxel ( Taxol ) and docetaxel ( Taxotere ) . Paclitaxel was originally derived from the Pacific yew tree . Taxanes have been used to produce various chemotherapy drugs . The principal mechanism of action of the taxane class of drugs is the disruption of microtubule function . Microtubules are essential to cell division , and taxanes stabilize GDP-bound tubulin in the microtubule , thereby inhibiting the process of cell division - a `` frozen mitosis '' . Thus , in essence , taxanes are mitotic inhibitors . In contrast to the taxanes , the vinca alkaloids destroy mitotic spindles . Both taxanes and vinca alkaloids are , therefore , named spindle poisons or mitosis poisons , but they act in different ways . Taxanes are also thought to be radiosensitizing . Taxanes are difficult to synthesize because of their numerous chiral centres - taxol has 11 of these . Taxanes present difficulties in formulation as medicines because they are poorly soluble in water .
As of December 2008 . Navarre is a region in northern Spain , constituting one of its autonomous communities - the `` Chartered Community of Navarre '' . Its principal city is Pamplona . During the time of the Roman Empire , the territory of the province was inhabited by the Vascones , a pre-Roman tribe who populated the southern slopes of the Pyrenees . The Vascones managed to maintain their separate Basque language and traditions even under the Roman rule . The area was never fully subjugated either by the Visigoths or by the Arabs . In A.D. 778 , the Basques defeated a Frankish army in the Battle of Roncevaux Pass . Two generations later , in 824 , the chieftain IÃ igo Arista was chosen King of Pamplona , laying a foundation for the later Kingdom of Navarre . That kingdom reached its zenith during the reign of Sancho III of Navarre and covered the area of the present-day Navarre , Basque country , and La Rioja , together with parts of modern Cantabria , Castile and LeÃ n , and Aragon . After Sancho III died , the Kingdom of Navarre was divided between his sons and never fully recovered its importance . The army of Navarre fought beside other Christian Spanish kingdoms in the decisive battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 , after which the Muslim conquests on the Iberian Peninsula were slowly reduced to a small territory in the south . In A.D. 1515 , the bulk of Navarre south of the Pyrenees -- Upper Navarre -- was at last absorbed into the incipient Kingdom of Spain but retained some exclusive rights . The small portion of Navarre lying north of the Pyrenees -- Lower Navarre -- later came under French rule when its Huguenot sovereign became King Henry IV of France ; with the declaration of the French Republic and execution of Louis XVI , the last King of France and Navarre , the kingdom was merged into a unitary French state . The community ceremonies , education , and social services , together with housing , urban development , and environment protection policies are under the responsibility of its own institutions . Unlike other regions ( and like the Basque Country ) , it has almost full responsibility for collecting and administering taxes which must follow the overall guidelines established by the Spanish government but may have some minor differences . It is made up of 272 municipalities and has a total population of 601,874 ( 2006 ) , of which approximately one-third live in the capital , Pamplona ( 195,769 pop . ) , and one-half in the capital 's metropolitan area ( 315,988 pop . ) . There are no other large municipalities in the region . The next largest are Tudela ( 32,802 ) , BaraÃ Ã in ( 22,401 ) , Burlada ( 18,388 ) , Estella - Lizarra ( 13,892 ) , Zizur Mayor ( 13,197 ) , Tafalla ( 11,040 ) , Villava\/Atarrabia ( 10,295 ) , and AnsoÃ in ( 9,952 ) . Despite its relatively small size , Navarre features stark contrasts in geography , from the Pyrenees mountain range that dominates the territory to the plains of the Ebro river valley in the south . The highest point in Navarre is Hiru Erregeen Mahaia , with an elevation of 2,428 metres ( 7,965 feet ) . Navarre is a mixture of its Vasconic tradition , the Trans-Pyrenean influx of people and ideas and Mediterranean influences coming from the Ebro . The Ebro valley is amenable to wheat , vegetables , wine , and even olive trees as in Aragon and La Rioja . It was a part of the Roman Empire , inhabited by the Vascones , later controlled on its southern fringes by the Muslims Banu Qasi , whose authority was taken over by the taifa kingdom of Tudela in the 11th century . During the Reconquista , Navarre gained little ground at the expense of the Muslims . Starting in the 11th century , the Way of Saint James grew a very important milestone for the territory and source of European cultural influence . Gascons and Occitanians altogether from beyond the Pyrenees ( called Franks ) were granted privileges to foster their settlement in Navarrese towns , causing them to bring along their craft , culture and Romance languages . Jews and Muslims could n't escape the drastic measures imposed on them and were expelled for the most part in a process spanning half a century at the end of the 15th century and start of the 16th , definitely after Navarre was seized by Castile-Aragon . Navarre leads Europe in its use of renewable energy technology and is planning to reach 100 % renewable electricity generation by 2010 . By 2004 , 61 % of the region 's electricity was generated by renewable sources consisting of 43.6 % from 28 wind farms , 12 % from over 100 small-scale water turbines , and 5.3 % from 2 biomass and 2 biogas plants . In addition , the region had what was then Spain 's largest photovoltaic power plant at Montes de Cierzo de Tudela ( 1.2 MWp capacity ) plus several hundred smaller photovoltaic installations . Developments since 2004 have included further photovoltaic plants at LarriÃ n ( 0.25 MWp ) and another at CastejÃ n ( 2.44 MWp ) , also once the largest in Spain . Spanish is the official language in Navarre , together with Basque , which also has official status in the Basque-speaking area . The north-western part of the community is largely Basque-speaking , while the southern part is almost entirely Spanish-speaking , aside from Fitero . The capital , Pamplona , is in the mixed region .
SNAFU is an acronym that stands for situation normal : all fucked up . It is sometimes bowdlerized to situation normal all fouled up or similar . In simple terms , it means that the normal situation is in a bad state , as it always is , therefore nothing unexpected . It 's usually used in jest , or as a sign of frustration . The acronym is believed to have originated in the US Army during World War II . In modern usage , snafu is sometimes used as an interjection . Snafu also sometimes refers to a bad situation , mistake , or cause of trouble . For example , in 2005 , The New York Times published an article titled `` Hospital Staff Cutback Blamed for Test Result Snafu '' . As used in a military context , `` SNAFU '' was first recorded in American Notes and Queries in their September 1941 issue . Time magazine used the term in their June 16 , 1942 issue : `` Last week U.S. citizens knew that gasoline rationing and rubber requisitioning were snafu . '' Most reference works , including the Random House Unabridged Dictionary , supply an origin date of 1940-1944 , generally attributing it to the U.S. Army . Rick Atkinson ascribes the origin of SNAFU , FUBAR , and a bevy of other terms to cynical GIs ridiculing the Army 's penchant for acronyms . Proprietary variants of the phrase are also attributed to two of the primary military services of the time . The Navy version went : `` Situation normal ; Army fucked up '' , while the Army retort was `` Some Navy asshole fucked up '' . The attribution of `` SNAFU '' to the American military is not universally accepted . It has also been attributed to the British . East Of Eden published an album called Snafu in 1970 . Carole Landis and Martha Raye performed a skit about SNAFU sometime during the war . The Army and Warner Bros. . Cartoons produced training cartoons during WWII featuring a character called Private Snafu who always did the wrong thing . Snafu was the name of a British rhythm and blues\/rock-band of the 1970s . Snafu was a game published for the Intellivision gaming console ( Mattel Electronics ) and featured `` snakes '' that had to box each other in or eat each others ' tails to win . A character in the HBO Miniseries The Pacific is known as SNAFU : Cpl . Merriell Shelton , played by Rami Malek . The game Screwball Scramble was once released in the U.S. under the name Snafu .
Sombreffe is a Walloon municipality located in the Belgian province of Namur . On 1 January 2006 the municipality had 7,615 inhabitants . The total area is 35.78 kmÂ , giving a population density of 213 inhabitants per kmÂ .
Software versioning is the process of assigning either unique version names or unique version numbers to unique states of computer software . Within a given version number category ( major , minor ) , these numbers are generally assigned in increasing order and correspond to new developments in the software . At a fine-grained level , revision control is often used for keeping track of incrementally different versions of electronic information , whether or not this information is actually computer software . A variety of version numbering schemes have been created to keep track of different versions of a piece of software . The ubiquity of computers has also led to these schemes being used in contexts outside computing . In sequence-based software versioning schemes , each software release is assigned a unique identifier that consists of one or more sequences of numbers or letters . This is the extent of the commonality , however , schemes vary widely in areas such as the quantity of sequences , the attribution of meaning to individual sequences , and the means of incrementing the sequences . In some schemes , sequence-based identifiers are used to convey the significance of changes between releases : changes are classified by significance level , and the decision of which sequence to change between releases is based on the significance of the changes from the previous release , whereby the first sequence is changed for the most significant changes , and changes to sequences after the first represent changes of decreasing significance . For instance , in a scheme that uses a four-sequence identifier , the first sequence may be incremented only when the code is completely rewritten , while a change to the user interface or the documentation may only warrant a change to the fourth sequence . This practice permits users ( or potential adopters ) to evaluate how much real-world testing a given software release has undergone . If changes are made between , say , 1.3 rc4 and the production release of 1.3 , then that release , which asserts that it has had a production-grade level of testing in the real world , in fact contains changes which have not necessarily been tested in the real world at all . This approach commonly permits the third level of numbering ( `` change '' ) , but does not apply this level of rigor to changes in that number : 1.3.1 , 1.3.2 , 1.3.3 , 1.3.4 ... 1.4.1 , etc. In principle , in subsequent releases , the major number is increased when there are significant jumps in functionality , the minor number is incremented when only minor features or significant fixes have been added , and the revision number is incremented when minor bugs are fixed . A typical product might use the numbers 0.9 ( for beta software ) , 0.9.1 , 0.9.2 , 0.9.3 , 1.0 , 1.0.1 , 1.0.2 , 1.1 , 1.1.1 , 2.0 , 2.0.1 , 2.0.2 , 2.1 , 2.1.1 , 2.1.2 , 2.2 , etc. . Developers have at times jumped ( for example ) from version 5.0 to 5.5 to indicate that significant features have been added , but not enough to warrant incrementing the major version number , though this is improper . A different approach is to use the major and minor numbers , along with an alphanumeric string denoting the release type , i.e. `` alpha '' , `` beta '' or `` release candidate '' . A release train using this approach might look like 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.9 1.0 rc1 ( which , if it is stable enough ) Designating development stageSeparating sequencesNumber of sequencesIncrementing sequencesUsing negative numbersDegree of compatibilityDateYear of releaseTeXAppleOther schemesInternal version numbersPre-release versionsOdd-numbered versions for development releasesApplePolitical and cultural significance of version numbersVersion 1.0 as a milestoneTo describe program historyKeeping up with competitorsOvercoming perceived marketing difficultiesSignificance in software engineeringSignificance in technical supportVersion numbers for files and documentsVersion number ordering systemsUse in other media = = Software-style version numbers may be used in other media , playing on associations of version numbers with high technology .

Pietro Longhi ( 1702 or November 5 , 1701 â `` May 8 , 1785 ) was a Venetian painter of contemporary scenes of life . Pietro Longhi was born in Venice in the parish of Saint Maria , first child of the silversmith Alessandro Falca and his wife , Antonia . He adopted the Longhi last name when he began to paint . He was initially taught by the Veronese painter Antonio Balestra , who then recommended the young painter to apprentice with the Bolognese Giuseppe Maria Crespi , who was highly regarded in his day for both religious and genre painting . He was married in 1732 to Caterina Maria Rizzi . Among his early paintings are some altarpieces and religious themes . In 1734 , he completed frescoes in the walls and ceiling of the hall in Ca ' Sagredo , representing the Death of the giants . Henceforward , his work would lead him to be viewed in the future as the Venetian William Hogarth , painting subjects and events of everyday life in Venice . The gallant interior scenes reflect the 18th century 's turn towards the private and the bourgeois . Many of his paintings show Venetians at play , such as the depiction of the crowd of genteel citizens awkwardly gawking at a freakish Indian rhinoceros ( see image ) . This painting chronicles Clara the rhinoceros brought to Europe in 1741 by a Dutch sea captain and impresario from Leyden , Douvemont van der Meer . This rhinoceros was exhibited in Venice in 1751 . There are two versions of this painting , nearly identical except for the unmasked portraits of two men in Ca ' Rezzonico version . Ultimately , there may be a punning joke to the painting , since the young man on the left holds aloft the sawed off horn ( metaphor for cuckoldry ) of the animal . Perhaps this explains the difference between the unchaperoned women . Other paintings chronicle the daily activities such as the gambling parlors ( Riddoti ) that proliferated in the 18th century . In some , the insecure or naive posture and circumstance , the puppet-like delicacy of the persons , seem to suggest a satirical perspective of the artists toward his subjects . Nearly half of the figures in his genre paintings are faceless , hidden behind Venetian Carnival masks . Like Crespi before him , Longhi was commissioned to paint seven canvases documenting the seven Catholic sacraments . Longhi is well-known as a draughtsman , whose drawings were often done for their own sake , rather than as studies for paintings . Pietro 's son , Alessandro , was also an accomplished painter . A paraphrase of Bernard Berenson states that `` Longhi painted for the Venetians passionate about painting , their daily lives , in all dailiness , domesticity , and quotidian mundane-ness . In the scenes regarding the hairdo and the apparel of the lady , we find the subject of gossip of the inopportune barber , chattering of the maid ; in the school of dance , the amiable sound of violins . It is not tragic ... but upholds a deep respect of customs , of great refinement , with an omnipresent good humor distinguishes the paintings of the Longhi from those of Hogarth , at times pitiless and loaded with omens of change '' .

Her parents had six relationships between them , which gave her 4 sisters and 5 brothers , including fellow actresses Holly Davidson and Jade Davidson ; primary school teacher Jessi Frost , brothers called Gabriel Jupiter and Tobias Vaughan ; and a sister named Sunshine Purple Tara Velvet . One of Frost 's stepfathers - the rock photographer Robert Davidson - was a follower of the Bhagwan cult , who forbade the children to say the words â Noâ or â Sorryâ ; during her father 's colour-therapy phase , he insisted that everybody in the house wear orange and he wouldnâ t let them eat anything that was red . They also had to take showers wearing tracksuits , and they were forced to refer to objects as the most opposite they could think of as a test of character , for example calling apples elephants . Sadie appeared in a Jelly Tots advertisement at age 3 and appeared with Morecambe and Wise at age 5 . She attained a scholarship to the Italia Conti Academy , but after an early eating disorder , she gave up acting at 13 and attended Hampstead School . On graduation she left home to escape her parents , and at 19 she appeared in a play called Mumbo Jumbo at the Manchester Royal Exchange Theatre , directed by Nicholas Hytner . As an actress , Sadie has performed in : Press Gang and Casualty . Her first film role was in Diamond Skulls , though her most memorable film appearance is as vampire Lucy Westenra in Francis Ford Coppolaâ s Bram Stoker 's Dracula in 1992 . She earned her living mainly through appearing in music videos , including for Pulp 's song `` Common People '' , Planet Perfecto featuring Grace `` Not Over Yet ' 99 '' ; and various productions for Spandau Ballet where she met first husband Gary Kemp . Frost and Kemp appeared together in the 1990s film The Krays . They appeared in 2 more movies together , one of which was filmed while they were separated : 1994 's film Magic Hunter , which even required them to participate in a love scene . Frost took a role opposite Jude Law in Paul W. S. Anderson 's directorial debut Shopping . After marrying Law and having three children with him , she cut down on her acting commitments in the late 1990s , and moved into producing and co-founding the production company Natural Nylon . In 1999 , she co-founded the fashion label FrostFrench with her friend , Jemima French . The label started in lingerie and expanded into clothing collections . FrostFrench won Elle Magazineâ s Designers of the Year Award 2004 . In 2004 , she wrote , presented and produced a short lived series What Sadie did next ... for E4 , and in 2005 appeared in Eating with ... Sadie Frost on BBC2 . In March 2006 , Frost flew to South Africa to part-fund an orphanage for the Homes of Hope project . In September 2006 , aged 40 , she posed nude for Canadian photographer Bryan Adams for a PETA anti-fur advert to coincide with London Fashion Week . In 2009 , she made her West End debut in Touched ... For the Very First Time , a new one-woman show by ZoÃ `` Lewis , directed by Douglas Rintoul and produced by Imogen Lloyd Webber . In January 2010 she starred in the play Fool For Love alongside Carl Barat , formerly of The Libertines . The play showed at the Riverside Studios theater . When 16 and dancing in a music video , she met Spandau Ballet 's Gary Kemp . They married on 7 May 1988 and their son , Finlay Munro , was born on 20 September 1990 . Frost and Kemp were married for 5 years and separated for 2 ; they divorced on 19 August 1995 . She met Jude Law during the work on the film Shopping . They married on 2 September 1997 and had three children : son Rafferty ( born 6 October 1996 ) , daughter Iris ( born 25 October 2000 ) and son Rudy Indiana Otis ( born 10 September 2002 ) . Frost and Law divorced on 29 October 2003 .
Med Hondo ( born Mohamed Abid Hondo , 1936 ) is a Mauritanian film director , producer , screenwriter , actor and voice actor . He emigrated to France in 1959 and began to work in film during the 1960s . He received critical acclaim for his 1967 directorial dÃ but Soleil O. Hondo was born in 1936 in Ain Oul Beri Mathar in the Atar region of Mauritania . His mother was Mauritanian and his father Senegalese . In 1954 he went to live in Rabat , Morocco to train to become a chef at the International Hotel School there . He emigrated to France in 1959 and found work first in Marseilles and then in Paris , variously as a cook , farm labourer , waiter , dockworker and delivery man . He found that he , and other African immigrants , were unable to find jobs in their chosen professions , and in the menial jobs they could find , were paid less than the French . The difficulty of making a living during this time , as well as racism he experienced , eventually provided inspiration for his films , including Soleil O and Les ` bicots-N Ã gres ' vos voisins . Hondo began to take classes in acting and directing , and studied under French actress FranÃ oise Rosay , acting in classic plays by Shakespeare , MoliÃ re and Jean Racine . He was unable to fully express himself with French repertoire theater , and in 1966 formed his own theater company with Guadelopean actor Robert Liensol . Named Shango ( from Shango , the Yoruba god of thunder ) , and later Griot-Shango , the company produced plays relating more to the experiences of Black people , including work by RenÃ Depestre , AimÃ CÃ saire , Daniel Boukman and Guy Menga . In the late 1960s , Hondo started taking small roles in television and films . At the same time , he began to learn the craft of film making by careful observation of the work of others , and began to get work behind the camera . He began his first film , Soleil O in 1965 . Made on a budget of $ 30,000 , Soleil O was financed by Hondo 's work dubbing American films into French . It played at during International Critics ' Week at the 1970 Cannes Film Festival where it received critical acclaim . It received a Golden Leopard Award at the 1970 Locarno International Film Festival . Some of Hondo 's acting work has been as a voice actor , in films and television series like Funky Cops and Asterix and the Vikings . He has worked on the dubbing of many English language films into French , voicing characters of Eddie Murphy , Danny Glover ( on the rare occasions when he was not dubbed by white actor Richard Darbois ) , Sidney Poitier , Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley . He has dubbed several of Eddie Murphy 's films including The Nutty Professor and the part of Donkey in 2001 's Shrek . Med Hondo explains on his website that he met with Danny Glover in 1991 and exposed his then current project to him : a biopic of Haitian revolutionary Toussaint Louverture . An enthusiastic Glover would have then voiced his interest in playing the main part and taking part in the production , before cutting all communication with Hondo and co-writer Claude Veillot . Hondo now claims that Glover 's current Louverture biopic project , financially backed by Hugo Chavez , was inspired by his own original screenplay and addressed an open letter to Glover in which he denies assertions from Glover 's `` Louverture Films '' company that the script was a commission paid by Glover to Hondo . Hondo also mentions his meeting with Glover in an English-spoken interview on French international news channel France 24 .

Polydeuces is a very small natural satellite of Saturn that is co-orbital with Dione and librates around the trailing Lagrangian point . Its diameter is estimated to be about 3.5 km . Polydeuces was discovered by the Cassini Imaging Team on October 24 , 2004 , in images taken on October 21 , 2004 , and given the temporary designation S\/2004 S 5 . Subsequent searches of earlier Cassini imaging showed it in images as far back as April 9 , 2004 . Polydeuces is also designated as Saturn XXXIV . Of the four known Lagrangian co-orbitals in the Saturn system , Polydeuces wanders the farthest from its Lagrangian point . The libration takes it away from the by up to 31.4 Â in the direction away from Dione , and 26.1 Â towards it with a period of 790.931 days ( for comparison , trails Dione by 60 Â ) . Polydeuces ' libration is large enough that it takes on some qualities of a tadpole orbit , as evidenced by the clear asymmetry between excursions towards and away from Dione . In the course of one such cycle , Polydeuces ' orbital radius also varies by about Â 7660 km with respect to Dione 's . The name Polydeuces was approved by the IAU Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature on January 21 , 2005 . In Greek mythology , Polydeuces is another name for Pollux , twin brother of Castor , son of Zeus and Leda .
In mathematics , a convex regular 4-polytope ( or polychoron ) is a 4-dimensional polytope that is both regular and convex . These are the four-dimensional analogs of the Platonic solids ( in three dimensions ) and the regular polygons ( in two dimensions ) . These polytopes were first described by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig SchlÃ fli in the mid-19th century . SchlÃ fli discovered that there are precisely six such figures . Five of these may be thought of as higher dimensional analogs of the Platonic solids . There is one additional figure ( the 24-cell ) which has no three-dimensional equivalent . Each convex regular 4-polytope is bounded by a set of 3-dimensional cells which are all Platonic solids of the same type and size . These are fitted together along their respective faces in a regular fashion . The following tables lists some properties of the six convex regular polychora . The symmetry groups of these polychora are all Coxeter groups and given in the notation described in that article . The number following the name of the group is the order of the group . where N ` k denotes the number of k-faces in the polytope ( a vertex is a 0-face , an edge is a 1-face , etc. ) . The following table shows some 2 dimensional projections of these polytopes . Various other visualizations can be found in the external links below . The Coxeter-Dynkin diagram graphs are also given below the SchlÃ fli symbol .

The Jyutping method allows a user to input Chinese characters by entering the jyutping of a Chinese character ( with or without tone , depending on the system ) and then presenting the user with a list of possible characters with that pronunciation . S-type asteroids are of a siliceous ( stony ) composition , hence the name . Approximately 17 % of asteroids are of this type , making it the second most common after the C-type . S-types are moderately bright ( with an albedo of 0.10 to 0.22 ) and consist mainly of iron - and magnesium-silicates . They are dominant in the inner main belt within 2.2 AU , common in the central belt within about 3 AU , but become rare farther out . The largest is 15 Eunomia ( about 330 km wide across its longest dimension ) , with the next largest members by diameter being 3 Juno , 29 Amphitrite , 532 Herculina and 7 Iris . These largest S-types are visible in 10x50 binoculars at most oppositions ; the brightest , 7 Iris , can occasionally become brighter than +7.0 , which is a higher magnitude than any asteroid except the unusually reflective 4 Vesta . Their spectrum has a moderately steep slope at wavelengths shorter than 0.7 Â m , and has moderate to weak absorption features around 1 Â m and 2 Â m . The 1 Â m absorption is indicative of the presence of silicates ( stony minerals ) . Often there is also a broad but shallow absorption feature centered near 0.63 Â m . The composition of these asteroids is similar to a variety of stony meteorites which share similar spectral characteristics This whole `` S '' assemblage of asteroids is spectrally quite distinct from the carbonaceous C-group and the mostly metallic X-group .
The Sandman is a children 's book written by Ralph Fletcher and illustrated by Richard Cowdrey . It was first published in 2008 by Henry Holt and Company . Tor is an inches tall man who can not fall asleep no matter what he tries . He discovers a dragon scale while walking in the woods . He learns that the powder made by grinding the scale induces sleep . He then travels sprinkling the sand into the eyes of sleepless children . Ian Chipman in his review for Booklist said `` Fletcherâ s spin on the classic character responsible for suddenly leaden lids is helped along by Cowdryâ s quaint , deeply hued artwork . '' He described the book as `` charming and comforting bedtime tale . '' Kirkus Reviews said `` Fletcher 's fantasy narrative fleshes out the familiar trope by combining worlds of fairy-tale-forest settings with average household bedtime environments . Cowdrey 's deeply colored acrylics of flora , fauna , one frightfully greenish and nostril-smoking dragon , workshop scenes and angelically dozing children alternate with black-and-white images of a cherubic dimple-chinned bald and white mustachioed tiny gentleman hard at work . '' Lauralyn Persson in her review for School Library Journal said `` Fletcher 's smoothly written story flows in a thoroughly plausible way and is beautifully served by Cowdrey 's vibrant acrylic paintings . All in all , this is a compelling story with pictures that add drama , charm , and atmosphere . ''
Arsenous acid , also known as arsenious acid , is the inorganic compound with the formula As ( OH ) 3 . It is known to occur in aqueous solutions , but it has not been isolated as a pure material , although this fact does not detract from the significance of As ( OH ) 3 . As ( OH ) 3 is a pyramidal molecule consisting of three hydroxyl groups bonded to arsenic . The 1H NMR spectrum of arsenous acid solutions consists of a single signal consistent with the molecule 's high symmetry . In contrast , the nominally related phosphorus species H3PO3 mainly adopts the structure HPO ( OH ) 2 ; P ( OH ) 3 is a very minor equilibrium component of such solutions . The differing behaviors of the As and P compounds reflect a trend whereby high oxidation states are more stable for lighter members of main group elements than their heavier congeners . The preparation of As ( OH ) 3 involves a slow hydrolysis of arsenic trioxide in water . Addition of base converts arsenous acid to the arsenite ions ( AsO ( OH ) 2 ) - , ( AsO2 ( OH ) ) 2 - , and ( AsO3 ) 3 - . The first pKa is 9.2 . Reactions attributed to aqueous arsenic trioxide are due to arsenous acid and its conjugate bases . Arsenic containing compounds are highly toxic and carcinogenic . The anhydride form of arsenous acid , arsenic trioxide , is used as a herbicide , pesticide , and rodenticide .
The butterflyfish are a group of conspicuous tropical marine fish of the family Chaetodontidae ; the bannerfish and coralfish are also included in this group . Found mostly on the reefs of the Atlantic , Indian and Pacific Oceans , there are approximately 120 species in 10 genera . A number of species pairs occur in the Indian and Pacific oceans , members of the huge genus Chaetodon . Butterflyfish look like smaller versions of angelfish ( Pomacanthidae ) but unlike these lack preopercle spines at the gill covers . Some members of the genus Heniochus resemble the Moorish Idol ( Zanclus cornutus ) of the monotypic Zanclidae . Among the paraphyletic `` Perciformes '' , the former are probably not too distantly related to butterflyfish , whereas the Zanclidae seem far less close . Butterflyfish mostly range from 12 t in length . The largest species , the lined butterflyfish and the saddle butterflyfish , C. ephippium , grow to 30 c. The common name references the brightly colored and strikingly patterned bodies of many species , bearing shades of black , white , blue , red , orange and yellow . Other species are dull in color . Many have eyespots on their flanks and dark bands across their eyes , not unlike the patterns seen on butterfly wings . Their deep , laterally narrow bodies are easily noticed through the profusion of reef life . The conspicuous coloration of butterflyfish may be intended for interspecies communication . Butterflyfish have uninterrupted dorsal fins with tail fins that may be rounded or truncated , but are never forked . Generally diurnal and frequenting waters of less than 18 m ( though some species descend to 180 m ) , butterflyfish stick to particular home ranges . The corallivores are especially territorial , forming mated pairs and staking claim to a specific coral head . Contrastingly , the zooplankton feeders form large conspecific groups . By night butterflyfish hide in reef crevices exhibit markedly different coloration . Their coloration also makes butterflyfish popular aquarium fish . However , most species feed on coral polyps and sea anemones . Balancing the relative populations of prey and predator is complex , leading Hobby aquarists to focus on the few generalists and specialist zooplankton feeders . Butterflyfish are pelagic spawners ; that is , they release many buoyant eggs into the water , which become part of the plankton , floating with the currents until hatching . The fry go through what is known as a tholichthys stage , wherein the body of the post-larval fish is covered in large bony plates extending from the head . They lose their bony plates as they mature . Only one other family of fish , the scats ( Scatophagidae ) express such an armored stage . The family name derives from the Ancient Greek words chaite ( `` hair '' ) and odontos ( `` tooth '' ) . This is an allusion to the rows of brush-like teeth found in their small , protrusile mouths . The Chaetodontidae can be , but is not usually , divided into two lineages that arguably are subfamilies . The subfamily name Chaetodontinae is a little-used leftover from the period when the Pomacanthidae and Chaetodontidae were united under the latter name as a single family . Hence , Chaetodontinae is today considered a junior synonym of Chaetodontidae . In any case , one lineage of Chaetodontidae ( in the modern sense ) contains the `` typical '' butterflyfishes around Chaetodon , while the other unites the bannerfish and coralfish genera . As the `` Perciformes '' are highly paraphyletic , the precise relationships of the Chaetodontidae as a whole are badly resolved . Before DNA sequencing , the taxonomy was confused about whether to treat these as species or subspecies . Also , numerous subgenera have been proposed for splitting out of Chaetodon , and it is becoming clear how to subdivide the genus if that is desired . The fossil record of this group is marginal . Their restriction to coral reefs means that their carcasses are liable to be dispersed by scavengers , overgrown by corals , and any that do fossilize will not long survive erosion . However , there is Pygaeus , a very basal fossil from the mid-late Eocene of Europe , dating approximately from the Bartonian 40-37 million years ago ( mya ) . Thus , the Chaetodontidae emerged probably in the early-mid Eocene . A crude molecular clock in combination with the evidence given by Pygaeus allows to place the initial split between the two main lineages to the mid-late Eocene , and together with the few other fossils it allows to deduce that most living genera were probably distinct by the end of the Paleogene 23 mya . The bannerfish-coralfish lineage can be further divided in two groups ; these might be considered tribes but have not been formally named . Genera are listed in order of the presumed phylogenetic , from the most ancient to the youngest :

Southampton Common is a large open space to the north of the city center of Southampton , England . It is bounded by the districts of Shirley , Bassett , Highfield and Portswood . The area supports a large variety of wildlife , including the largest recorded population of the internationally rare great crested newt . It is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest . Southampton Common currently includes 326 a of woodland , parkland , rough grassland , ponds , wetlands , nature trails , a paddling pool , a children 's play area , a model yachting pond , and a fishing lake . The Common is used for a wide variety of community events , Flower Festival , Race for life Cancer Research UK and formerly ` Power in the Park ' hosted by Power FM . The Hawthorns Urban Wildlife Centre at the southern end has been built on the former site of Southampton Zoo and the comprehensive displays document the natural history of the area ; with interactive resources , educational facilities and information about local wildlife and environmental management . To the west , bordering on Hill Lane , is a historic cemetery that also includes many rare flora and fauna . Cemetery Pond is popular for birds . The south east of the Common includes an open air paddling pool that has recently been refurbished and a play area for children . This is located near to a car parking zone and the Cowherds Public House , a local landmark which has a history going back to the 17th century . The history of Southampton Common can be traced back to a dispute over land rights in the 13th century , which was resolved by the Borough purchasing the land and declaring it common land . It became a public park in 1844 . The designation as Common Land allowed neighbors to use the land for fuel , clay , and taking berries and other wild , natural food . The most important use was for grazing , however , and there was a cowherd who was paid to be responsible for the cattle on the common . He was given accommodation in an inn on the site of today 's Cowherds pub .

Shinagawa is one of the 23 special wards of Tokyo , Japan . In English , it is called Shinagawa City . The ward is home to nine embassies . As of 2008 , the ward has an estimated population of 344,461 and a density of 15,740 persons per kmÂ . The total area is 22.72 kmÂ . Shinagawa includes natural uplands and lowlands , as well as reclaimed land . The uplands are the eastern end of the Musashino hills . They include Shiba Shiroganedai north of the Meguro River , Megurodai between the Meguro and Tachiai Rivers , and Ebaradai south of the Tachiai River . The ward lies on Tokyo Bay . Its neighbors on land are all special wards of Tokyo : KÅ tÅ to the east , Minato to the north , Meguro to the west , and Å ta to the south . Most of Tokyo east of the Imperial Palace is reclaimed land . A large portion of reclamation happened during the Edo period . Following the Meiji restoration and the Abolition of the han system , Shinagawa prefecture was instituted in 1869 . The prefectural administration was planned to be set up in present-day Shinagawa in the Ebara district . In 1871 , Shinagawa prefecture was integrated into Tokyo Prefecture . The ward was founded on March 15 , 1947 through the administrative amalgamation of the former Ebara Ward with the former Shinagawa Ward . Both Ebara Ward and Shinagawa Ward had been created in 1932 , with the outward expansion of the municipal boundaries of the Tokyo City following the 1923 Great KantÅ Earthquake . In the Edo period , Shinagawa was the first post town a traveler would reach after setting out from Nihonbashi on the TÅ kaidÅ highway from Edo to Kyoto . The post-town function is retained today with several large hotels near the train station offering 6,000 hotel rooms , the largest concentration in the city . The Tokugawa shogunate maintained the Suzugamori execution grounds in Shinagawa . The TÅ kaidÅ Shinkansen began serving Shinagawa Station from 2003 , and the nearby Shinagawa Intercity office complex will be served by a new subway station in a few years ' time .

Lokeren is a municipality located in the Belgian province of East Flanders . The municipality comprises the city of Lokeren proper and the towns of Daknam and Eksaarde . It is located on the Durme , a tributary of the Scheldt , and is the second most important city of the Waasland after Sint-Niklaas . Mayor Filip Anthuenis ( VLD ) was elected for a second mandate during the elections on October 8 , 2006 . Archaeological finds on the Lokeren territory prove that this area was populated in Neolithic times . A Roman road ran along the Durme river . The name Waas was given to this area by the Romans from the Germanic root Wasu meaning â marshy landâ . The first mention of the name Lokeren , however , dates from 1114 . Unlike the older settlements , the new village came to be built on the right bank of the Durme . By the middle of the 12th century , it had become an independent parish , with agriculture and flax as the two main drivers of the economy . The textile industry would remain important until well into the 20th century . In 1555 , Charles V gave Lokeren the right to hold a market . In the 16th and 17th century , the whole Waasland was in the line of fire between Protestant Netherlands and Catholic Spain , often with terrible consequences for the local population . After the French Revolution , the area was made part of the new DÃ partement de lâ Escaut , with Lokeren at the head of a canton . This did not last long as the department was split in 1800 and Lokeren made part of the arrondissement of Dendermonde . Napoleon Bonaparte promoted the town to the status of city in 1804 . Until the 1970s , haircutting ( an industrial practice of cutting hair from rabbit skins to make felt , a basic material for hat makers ) and slaughterhouses were among Lokerenâ s main industries . Today , the city enjoys a more varied economical and cultural infra-structure .
In geometrical optics , a focus , also called an image point , is the point where light rays originating from a point on the object converge . Although the focus is conceptually a point , physically the focus has a spatial extent , called the blur circle . This non-ideal focusing may be caused by aberrations of the imaging optics . In the absence of significant aberrations , the smallest possible blur circle is the Airy disc , which is caused by diffraction from the optical system 's aperture . Aberrations tend to get worse as the aperture diameter increases , while the Airy circle is smallest for large apertures . An image , or image point or region , is in focus if light from object points is converged almost as much as possible in the image , and out of focus if light is not well converged . The border between these is sometimes defined using a circle of confusion criterion . A diverging ( negative ) lens , or a convex mirror , does not focus a collimated beam to a point . Instead , the focus is the point from which the light appears to be emanating , after it travels through the lens or reflects from the mirror . A convex parabolic mirror will reflect a beam of collimated light to make it appear as if it were radiating from the focal point , or conversely , reflect rays directed toward the focus as a collimated beam . A convex elliptical mirror will reflect light directed towards one focus as if it were radiating from the other focus , both of which are behind the mirror . A convex hyperbolic mirror will reflect rays emanating from the focal point in front of the mirror as if they were emanating from the focal point behind the mirror . Conversely , it can focus rays directed at the focal point that is behind the mirror towards the focal point that is in front of the mirror as in a Cassegrain telescope .

Libonectes ( meaning `` southwest swimmer '' ) is an extinct genus of sauropterygian reptile belonging to the plesiosaur order . It is known from a single fossil specimen found in the Britton Formation of Texas , dated to the lower Turonian stage of the late Cretaceous period . The animal was very similar to the related Thalassomedon , though the structure of the neck vertebrae were different , with taller neural spines and longer supporting processes of the bone , and its nostrils were slightly closer to the tip of the skull . The skull of the type specimen is the best preserved elasmosaurid skull known . The specimen consists of the skull and neck , as well as gastroliths found along with the fossil . A shoulder girdle and flipper were also found but were apparently discarded at some point in the past . The specimen was originally named Elasmosaurus morgani by Welles in 1949 , but it was reclassified in its own genus by Carpenter in 1997 .
It is presented at Boskone , NESFA 's annual convention . Sinornithoides ( meaning `` Chinese bird form '' ) is a genus of troodontid theropod dinosaur . It lived during the Early Cretaceous ( Barremian stage , around 130 125 million years ago ) . It measured approximately 1 meter long ( 3 ft ) . It lived in Inner Mongolia , China , and probably ate invertebrates and other small prey . Sinornithoides youngi , the type species , was described in 1993 by Dale Russell and Dong Zhiming based on a fossil specimen from the Ejinhoro Formation . It is represented by a holotype which is articulated and nearly complete except for the roof of the skull and the cervical and dorsal vertebrae , along with some other referred skeletal elements .
Storms of My Grandchildren is climate scientist James Hansen 's first book , published by Bloomsbury Press in 2009 . The book is about threats to people and habitability for life on earth from global warming . In the book , Hansen argues that burning of fossil fuels is changing our climate and that the Earth is in `` imminent peril '' . He suggests that millions of species , and humanity itself , are threatened . The title of the book , Storms of My Grandchildren , refers to the ferocious and extreme weather events `` that will greet the next generation if the unmitigated use of fossil fuels continues '' . In Hansen 's evaluation , the response of politicians to this crisis has mainly been `` greenwashing '' , where their proposals sound good but amount to little . Hansen states that we immediately need to `` reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide to at most 350 ppm in order to avoid disasters for coming generations '' . He advocates prompt phaseout of coal plant emissions , plus improved forestry and agricultural practices . Hansen supports a carbon tax returned to citizens as a dividend and rejects cap and trade . He also supports nuclear power and rejects geoengineering . Storms of My Grandchildren has been reviewed in Nature , the Los Angeles Times , Science , and Cosmos . An excerpt from the book appeared in The Nation in 2009 . James Hansen is director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and is often called the `` father of global warming '' .

Polish Wikipedia is the Polish edition of Wikipedia . The ninth-oldest edition of Wikipedia , it was started on September 26 , 2001 . It has about articles and is the fourth largest Wikipedia edition ( after the English , German , and French editions ) . It is also the largest edition in a Slavic language by the number of articles , as well as the largest for a language spoken officially in just one country . The Polish Wikipedia originated as an independent project under the domain wiki.rozeta.com . pl . At the suggestion of the founders of the English Wikipedia , the site was incorporated in the international project as http://pl.wikipedia.com on January 12 , 2002 and as http://pl.wikipedia.org later that year on November 22 . To avoid domain squatting that could frustrate potential users , the Polish Wikipedia also has its own domain wikipedia . pl that redirects to pl.wikipedia.org . Polish Wikipedia has quite low depth parameters ( currently ) compared to other Slavic editions . As of October 2010 , Polish Wikipedia has the lowest depth parameter among the twenty largest editions of Wikipedia , and the third lowest among editions with 100,000 or more articles ( slightly above VolapÃ 1\/4 k Wikipedia ) . The depth parameter attempts to measure the depth at which topics are covered in Wikipedia . Higher depth is given for more edits per article and more non-article pages in Wikipedia , like talk pages or user pages , per article . The words `` Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia '' in Polish are Wikipedia , wolna encyklopedia , pronounced . The Polish Wikipedia was first published on a DVD together with the paper edition of the magazine Enter SPECIAL in August 2005 . The releaser did not make any attempt to contact the Wikimedia Foundation prior to making the DVD available on the market and the edition itself turned out to be illegal as it violated the GNU GPL license . Additionally , the software used in that edition worked improperly under Microsoft Windows 98 . A new DVD edition was prepared as a joint project of the Polish branch of the Wikimedia Foundation ( Wikimedia Polska ) and the Polish publisher Helion . It contains articles written before June 4 , 2006 . The works were completed on November 24 , 2006 and the edition was released at the end of July 2007 . It cost 39 zlotys .

DP2 , meaning Diesel Prototype number 2 , was a prototype Type 4 mainline diesel locomotive built in 1962 by English Electric at their Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows to demonstrate its wares to British Railways . As the Deltics were then in production , it was decided to produce the locomotive on the same production line ; the bodyshell used for DP2 reputedly being the eighteenth made . While DP2 looked like a Class 55 locomotive in outline , there were many detail differences ; particularly the large bodyside radiator vents at one end , and the single roof fan as opposed to the four symmetrically placed fans on the Deltics . These differences revealed that DP2 was totally different from the twin-engined Deltics internally , having only a single prime mover and generator . The loco was later updated with electronic control systems to become the forerunner of the Class 50 . It was of Co-Co wheel arrangement and was fitted with an English Electric 16CSVT engine of 2700-hp . It had a maximum speed of 90 mph and weighed 105 tons . It was initially painted in standard BR Brunswick Green livery and later ( from 1965 ) in two-tone green livery with a light green lower bodyside band . BR tested it initially on London Midland Region services out of London Euston and later on the Eastern Region from London King 's Cross . Here it was frequently rostered on Class 55 diagrams but had difficulty in keeping to schedules - possessing only 82 % of the power of a Deltic . On the 31st of July 1967 it was involved in a serious accident at Thirsk , colliding at speed with the de-railed Cliffe ( Kent ) to Uddingston ( Glasgow ) cement train . The damage proved to be so great that it was considered uneconomical to repair . It was withdrawn from BR service in September 1967 and moved to the Vulcan Foundry where it was stored until it was scrapped in 1970 , its reusable parts being provided to the Class 50 pool of spares , its engine initially went to D417\/50 017 ` Royal Oak ' , but ended its working days in 50 037 .

This page lists direct English translations of common Latin phrases , such as veni vidi vici and et cetera . Some of the phrases are themselves translations of Greek phrases , as Greek rhetoric and literature were highly regarded in ancient Rome when Latin rhetoric and literature were still maturing . Be aware that the Latin letter i can be used as either a vowel or a consonant . When used as a consonant , it is often replaced by the letter j , which was originally simply an orthographic `` long i '' that was used in initial positions and when it occurred between two other vowels . This medieval convention is most commonly preserved in Latin legal terminology -- hence phrases like de iure are often spelled de jure . On this list , the more common form will be the one a phrase is listed under : thus , de jure is used instead of de iure , and alea iacta est instead of alea jacta est .
Watford is a station at the end of the Watford branch of London Underground 's Metropolitan Line in the north-western part of the network in Zone 7 , previously zone A. The station is in Cassiobury Park Avenue , at the junction with Metropolitan Station Approach , in the Cassiobury area of Watford . It is close to two of the entrances to Cassiobury Park . Despite the name suggesting a central location , it is some distance from Watford town center compared with the town 's other stations , and . It is known locally as `` Watford Met '' to distinguish it from these and the other Watford stations , which are all operated by National Rail . The station building is typical red-brick and was designed by C. W. Clark . Ticket barriers are in operation . Watford station opened on 4 November 1925 , as part of the extension of the line from , with electrical supply from the Metropolitan Railway , and a train service from the Great Central Railway to operating in the first few months . Although it is the terminus of the branch , it was not planned as such , with an extension to the town center ( Watford Central station ) envisaged but never constructed . The original Watford Central station building was in Watford High Street , opposite the junction with Clarendon Road , and has known many guises . In the 1950s this was the Grange Furniture Store and the original Underground station canopy was still in evidence . A JD Wetherspoon pub , The Moon Under Water , now occupies the building . For many years , a bus service ran from Watford station to the High Street . When travelcard zones were introduced Watford was in Zone B. From 2004 it moved to Zone A and in 2008 became part of Travelcard Zone 7 . A proposal known as the Croxley Rail Link envisages diverting the Metropolitan line away from its present route to . For many years , a short branch line from Watford Junction ran to nearby , though passenger usage was low . In 1996 , rail services were withdrawn and the line allowed to fall into disuse . The line comes very close to the Metropolitan Line south of Watford and it has often been proposed that there should be a short viaduct to link the two lines to create a through route to Watford Junction . This would lead to the closure of Watford station , but station could be given a new exit to provide a near enough service . This project , although small , has long faced problems with funding . As Watford is outside Greater London , normal sources of funding for the Tube are not available . Hertfordshire County Council do not have railways within their remit and so are unable to supply the funding on their own . However , the County Council , backed by Transport for London , are now leading a combined scheme to build the extension largely from a Government grant . TfL have agreed to commit almost Â # 18m to the scheme , and a submission to the Department for Transport has been made asking for a commitment in principle to pay the balance . The DfT 's response is still awaited . It is envisaged that the services on the lines so linked could be further enhanced by using the north-facing junction on the Metropolitan main line north of Moor Park to provide shuttle services between Watford Junction and , or even Aylesbury . It is believed that such a service would do much to enhance the entire area .

Campylobacter ( meaning ` twisted bacteria ' ) is a genus of bacteria that are Gram-negative , spiral , and microaerophilic . Motile , with either uni - or bi-polar flagella , the organisms have a characteristic spiral\/corkscrew appearance ( see photo ) and are oxidase-positive . Campylobacter jejuni is now recognized as one of the main causes of bacterial foodborne disease in many developed countries . At least a dozen species of Campylobacter have been implicated in human disease , with C. jejuni and C. coli the most common . C. fetus is a cause of spontaneous abortions in cattle and sheep , as well as an opportunistic pathogen in humans . The genomes of several Campylobacter species have been sequenced , providing insights into their mechanisms of pathogenesis . The first Campylobacter genome to be sequenced was C. jejuni , in 2000 . Campylobacter species contain two flagellin genes in tandem for motility , flaA and flaB . These genes undergo intergenic recombination , further contributing to their virulence . Non-motile mutants do not colonize . Campylobacteriosis is an infection by campylobacter . The common routes of transmission are fecal-oral , ingestion of contaminated food or water , and the eating of raw meat . It produces an inflammatory , sometimes bloody , diarrhea , periodontitis or dysentery syndrome , mostly including cramps , fever and pain . The infection is usually self-limiting and in most cases , symptomatic treatment by reposition of liquid and electrolyte replacement is enough in human infections . The use of antibiotics , on the other hand , is controversial . Symptoms typically last for 5 â `` 7 days . The sites of tissue injury include the jejunum , the ileum , and the colon . Most strains of C jejuni produce a toxin ( cytolethal distending toxin ) that hinders the cells from dividing and activating the immune system . This helps the bacteria to evade the immune system and survive for a limited time in the cells . It was thought previously that a cholera-like enterotoxin was also made , but this appears not to be the case . The organism produces diffuse , bloody , edematous , and exudative enteritis . In a small number of cases , the infection may be associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura through a poorly understood mechanism . Diagnosis of the illness is made by testing a specimen of faeces ( bowel motion ) . The symptoms of campylobacter infections were described in 1886 in infants by Theodor Escherich . These infections were named cholera infantum , or summer complaint . The genus was first discovered in 1963 ; however the organism was not isolated until 1972 .
The British Rail Class 02 were a class of twenty 0-4-0 diesel-hydraulic shunting locomotives built by the Yorkshire Engine Company in 1960 ( first ten , D2850-D2859 ) and 1961 ( D2860-D2869 ) for service in areas of restricted loading gauge and curvature such as docks . They had the door to the cab at the rear , with a railed veranda behind the cab ; this feature was very unusual on British Rail locomotives although was used on many Yorkshire Engine Co. designs and was\/is quite normal in North American practice . With the changes in the role of the British railway system and the closing of many of the facilities in which the Class 02 locomotives worked , they were increasingly surplus to requirements . The first locomotive was withdrawn from service in 1969 and the last one in 1973 . Only three survived long enough to enter the BR TOPS computer system : 02 001 ( formerly D2851 ) , 02 003 ( D2853 ) , and 02 004 ( D2856 ) . Being only nine to fourteen years old when withdrawn , they still had a lot of life left in them , and the majority were sold to private industry . One example was employed by the National Coal Board at Chatterley Whitfield Colliery near Stoke-on-Trent ; this locomotive ( BR number required ) stayed there when Chatterley Whitfield briefly became a mining museum . A large number ( at least seven ) are now in preservation , where their small size makes them perfect as a workshop shunter or for use in track maintenance work . One ( D2860 ) is the works shunter for the National Railway Museum in York , where it is used to move much larger exhibits around . The engine is a Rolls-Royce C6NFL176 6-cyl . in-line connected to a Rolls-Royce series 10,000 3-stage twin-disc torque converter and a manually operated YEC reduction and reversing final drive gearbox . The engine and transmission are mounted at an angle of 30 degrees to the horizontal to allow the overall length and height of the locomotive to be reduced . Unlike most earlier British Rail shunters , the Class 02s were built with train vacuum brakes . In addition to these locomotives produced for British Railways , around 50 very similar locomotives ( most with diesel-electric transmission and\/or more powerful engines ) were produced for industrial customers . Many of these can now be found in preservation also , since few industrial users have their own railways anymore . Quite a few are dressed up in fictitious British Railways livery and numbering ( for example - 02 101 ) .
A panhandle is an informal geographic term for an elongated arm-like protrusion of a geo-political entity , such as a subnational entity or a sovereign state . The term `` panhandle '' derives from the analogous part of a cooking pan , and its use is generally confined to the United States . A term used elsewhere is salient , derived from military salients . While similar to a peninsula in shape , a panhandle is not surrounded by water on three sides and connected to a geographical mainland . Instead , it is delimited by a land border on at least two sides and extends out from the larger geographical body of the administrative unit . The panhandle shape is the result of arbitrarily drawn international or subnational boundaries , although the location of some administrative borders takes into account other considerations such as economic ties or topography . In the United States , a protrusion with a less elongated shape is informally called a bootheel . â This definition of the Florida panhandle includes the following counties : Bay , Calhoun , Escambia , Franklin , Gadsden , Gulf , Holmes , Jackson , Jefferson , Leon , Liberty , Madison , Okaloosa , Santa Rosa , Taylor , Wakulla , Walton , and Washington . Outside the United States , the term is not in common usage , with the arguable exception of the nearby New Brunswick Panhandle . Nonetheless , some people would describe the following characteristic territorial protrusions elsewhere as a corridor or an arm extending into an administratively different territory . Such shapes of territory can be a result of linguistic ( or ethnic ) lines , in addition to geographic features and other reasons .
He considers that Rolle 's theorem for example , though it is of some importance for calculus , can not be compared to the elegance and preeminence of the mathematics produced by Leonhard Euler or Ã variste Galois and other pure mathematicians . White Hart Lane station in Tottenham was originally a station on the Stoke Newington & Edmonton Railway : it opened on 22 July 1872 . It is currently operated by National Express East Anglia and is in Travelcard Zone 3 , on the Seven Sisters branch of the Lea Valley Lines . The station is usually served by 8 trains per hour - four northbound ( towards Cheshunt or Enfield town ) and four southbound ( towards Liverpool street and also sometimes but rarely Stratford via South tottenham station on the London Overground line ) . In the peak time the station gets 12 trains per hour -- this time 6 northbound and 6 southbound . In the peak times the National express East Anglia services usually are 8 car trains and there are proposals to extend the platforms in order for a ninth car train to be re-introduced but this seems unlikely to happen . The station has a ticket office which is usually open all the time and there is also a few shops around the station which mainly sell food such as cakes and chips . The station has four entrances\/exits but two of these are only used on match day football games for local side Tottenham Hotspurs where the station becomes really busy . The ticket office is not open on Sundays but recently in 2010 on a few Sunday mornings the ticket office has been open but this has only been open for a few hours . There are proposals for ticketing for 19 hours a day - seven days a week by the time the December 2011 timetable will change that will alter the railway network . Along with several other stations on this line , White Hart Lane was radically altered in the early 1980s . A new ticket office was built and the two covered wooden staircases leading up to the platforms were replaced by two open air steel staircases . The waiting rooms on the London-bound platform ( which unusually were 2 -- 3 feet lower than the platform and had small steps leading down to them ) were boarded up and the roofs on both platforms were altered , with their ` dog-tooth ' facia boards being replaced by simple plywood fronts . The northbound roof was also shortened by around half of its original length . Also two uncovered brick-built staircases at the southern end of the station which went down to entrances at the junction of Love lane and Whitehall street ( used only on match days when Tottenham Hotspur played at home ) were also removed . The position of these staircases can still be made out at platform level . The station is the reason why the ground of nearby Tottenham Hotspur who play at football ground White hart lane which is under a five minute walk to the stadium . When the ground opened in 1897 , a proposal was made to name it ` Gilpin Park ' but the idea was dropped and for many years it was simply referred to as ` the High Road ground ' . In the 1920s , to indicate the proximity of the station to the ground and thus ` put the club on the map ' , the ground became known as ` White Hart Lane ' ( at the same time , Tottenham 's north London rivals , Arsenal , did the same thing but in reverse , changing the name of their local station , Gillespie road , to ` Arsenal ' station ) . The station is also near to new river sports centere and it is not to far from wood green shopping center and both are about a few minute bus rides on the London bus route W3 . The station is heavily used on match day football games for local side Tottenham Hotspur and there is a match day special timetable for this station with some trains arriving and departing every few minutes from the station . On match days three hours before kick-off trains from Hertford East , Bishops Stortford and sometimes even Cambridge and Stansted Airport call at White Hart Lane and this also continues for two hours after the match with trains starting and terminating here as well . The train station is the nearest to the stadium as it is about three minutes walk away from Tottenham Hotspur 's ground , White Hart Lane . The special timetables are usually the same but recently trains from Liverpool Street skip out the stops between the London terminus and White Hart Lane station and sometimes it will also pass Seven Sisters station which has underground links . The station is also near to Bruce Castle Park and also where a Tottenham carnival takes place every year also at Bruce Castle Park usually in mid June .

Hamilton Parish ( originally Bedford Parish ) is one of the nine parishes of Bermuda . It was renamed for Scottish aristocrat James Hamilton , 2nd Marquess of Hamilton ( 1589-1625 ) when he purchased the shares originally held in the Virginia Company by Lucy , Countess of Bedford . It is located in the northwest of the island chain , and is split in two by the large Harrington Sound , occupying all but the south and northeastern tip of its coast . The islands within the sound also form part of the parish . It is joined to Smith 's Parish in the south , and St. George 's Parish in the northeast . As with most of Bermuda 's parishes , it covers just over 2.3 square miles ( about 6.0 kmÂ or 1500 acres ) . Natural features in Hamilton include Flatt 's Inlet , Trunk Island , Shelly Bay , Bailey 's Bay , Mangrove Lake , Trott 's Pond , Crystal Cave , Castle Harbor , and The Causeway , which links Hamilton with St. George 's Parish . Notable locations in Hamilton include the Bermuda Aquarium and Museum and the small settlement of Flatt 's Village . Historically , the Colony 's government had on occasion met in Flatts Village , rather than the then Capital of St. George 's . The Village had prospered , in the days when the Colony 's economy was seafaring , according to popular accounts , due to its distance from customs officials in St. George 's . Bailey 's Bay , on the north shore of the Parish has also long been a thriving community , although it has never attained the status of a municipality . The name is used to denote an area which includes Callan Glen , the shallow depression running North-Eastward from Bailey 's Bay ( which was named for shipbuilder Claud MacCallan ) , Coney Island Walsingham , and that part of the Island running Westward as far as Abbot 's Cliff , on the Harrington Sound Shore . The area was long dominated by branches of the Outerbridge family ( which includes the MacCallans ) . Notable landmarks include the Abbot 's Cliff , Crystal Caves , and Mount Wyndham , once the location of Admiralty House , and from which the attack on Washington DC in 1815 was planned . Other sites of historical interest in the area include Tom Moore 's Tavern ( originally a private home , now a restaurant ) , and the adjacent nature reserve , and the Western end of the Causeway . Other non-municipal ` communal areas ' of Hamilton include the area around The Crawl , including Crawl Hill ( often referred to by locals as ` Crawl ' ) , and Shelly Bay . It is smaller than the Ontario one .
Associazione Calcio Ancona was a professional Italian football club , based in Ancona , Marche . It was founded in 1905 as Unione Sportiva Anconitana , changing its name to Ancona Calcio 1905 in 1981 and being refounded in 2004 with its last denomination . Ancona played the 2009 â `` 10 season in Serie B , finishing 17th and avoiding relegation , but eventually filed for bankruptcy and was unable to join any of the lower divisions . The club , however , managed to submit application for a place in Terza Categoria , the lowest level of the Italian football league system . Their application was accepted on 13 September 2010 , as they were granted a playing ground by the city administration . However , they were still lacking players and a manager and were subsequently forced to forfeit the first four games of the season . According to FIGC regulations , this led to the club 's removal from the league and they are now expected to undergo liquidation . Meanwhile , due to the uncertain future of A.C. Ancona , amateur side S.S. Piano San Lazzaro had become the main football club in the city . Backed up by the mayor and a vast majority of Ancona supporters , Piano switched their denomination to U.S. Ancona 1905 and started the 2010 â `` 11 season in Eccellenza . Ancona had spells in Serie B before World War II and shortly after , but would not return to that level until 1988 . Under coach Vincenzo Guerini , the club 's rise was meteoric : 5th place in 1990 and promotion was achieved two years later . Although they would finish 17th and were relegated after just one year , the club nonetheless played in some memorable high-scoring games including a 3 â `` 0 home win over Inter . Midfielder Lajos Detari , winger Fabio Lupo and striker Massimo Agostini ensured Ancona had a respectable Goals For tally but conceded goals at an alarming rate . The following year , Ancona reached an Italian Cup final but were heavily beaten by Sampdoria . Near misses in the promotion race was followed by relegation in 1996 and again in 1998 . After returning to Serie B in 2000 , Ancona would achieve another promotion in 2003 . Its second Serie A season would be one of the worst enjoyed by any Serie A club , with a record-equalling 28-game winless streak from the start . They finished the season with a pitiful 13 points . This was followed by bankruptcy and condemnation to Serie C2 . Ancona finished 5th in 2005 â `` 2006 season and lost promotion play-off against Sassuolo by finishing best place but promoted after expulsions of Gela and Sassari Torres due to financial troubles . They finished 16th in Serie C1\/B and played relegation play-off against Teramo in 2006 â `` 2007 season . Ancona won 4 â `` 2 by aggregate and remained in Serie C1 . In October 2007 it was reported that Centro Sportivo Italiano ( CSI ) , run by the Vatican 's Conference of Bishops , had purchased an 80 % share in the club . The report read : `` It is a way to moralise football , to bring some ethics to a sector that is going through a deep crisis of values , '' said Ancona Archbishop Edoardo Menichelli , who recently played a benefit game against an Italian national team of singers . CSI president Edio Costantini said the center wanted `` to invest in the true meaning of sport . We want football to be again a means of education and not tied to strictly monetary values '' . `` We will show that , for boys , football is not just an illusion or a bad example . '' According to Catholic World News on 9 October 2007 , the Vatican was distancing itself from the move , claiming the CSI was a group of ` lay Catholics ' and the Vatican had ` nothing to do ' with the project . Yet in a Reuters report on 11 October 2007 , both the Vatican Secretary of State and the Pope endorsed the move , quoted as saying respectively : Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone praised the project in a statement read at its presentation , saying it was designed to ` bring out the human and spiritual values in sport ' . The club has had several Papal connections . The ` Project Soccer ' initiative was blessed by Pope Benedict XVI with a letter sent by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone to the Centro Sportivo Italiano . The ` Del Conero ' stadium was visited by Pope John Paul II twice . The club has been promoted back to Serie B after winning promotion playoff after defeating Perugia by finished best place and Taranto by 2 â `` 1 aggregate in 2007 â `` 2008 season . Ancona finished 19th at Serie B at next season and faced with Rimini at play-outs . Ancona won them with a 2 â `` 1 aggregate and remained in it . Ancona finished 17th in Serie B despite 2 points deduction due to financial irregularities in 2009 â `` 10 season . See also . See . The main rivals of Ancona is Ascoli . The ultras of Ancona are noted for their anti-racist and anti-fascist stances .

The Piperaceae , also known as the pepper family , is a large family of flowering plants . The group contains roughly 3,610 currently accepted species in five genera . The vast majority of peppers can be found within the two main genera : Piper ( 2000 species ) and Peperomia ( 1600 species ) . Members of the Piperaceae may be small trees , shrubs or herbs . The distribution of this group is best described as pantropical . The most well known species is Piper nigrum , which yields most peppercorns that are used as spices , including black pepper , although its relatives in the family include many other spices . The name Pipereraceae is likely derived from the Sanskrit term pippali , which was used to describe long peppers ( like that of Piper longum ) . The APG III system of 2009 recognizes this family , and assigns it to the order Piperales in the unranked clade magnoliids . The family consists of five genera : Piper , Peperomia , Zippellia , Manekia , and Verhuellia . The previously recognized pacific genus Macropiper , was recently merged into Piper . A tentative cladogram showing relationships based on Wanke et al . ( 2007 ) is shown below . This phylogeny was based on 6000 basepairs of chloroplast DNA . Only recently has it become clear that Verhuellia is sister to the other four genera in the family . Members of pepper family are small trees , shrubs , or perennial or annual herbs . Plants are often rhizomatous , and can be terrestrial or epiphytic . The stems can be either simple or branched . Leaves are simple with entire margins , and are positioned at the base of the plant or along the stem , and can be alternate , opposite , or whorled in arrangement . Stipules are usually present , as are petioles . The leaves are often noticeably aromatic when crushed . Inflorescences ( in the form of spikes ) are terminal , opposite the leaves , or located in the axils . Flowers are bisexual , with no perianth , each flower is subtended by a peltate bract . Stamens are 2-6 , and hypogynous , with 2-locular anthers . There are usually 3-4 stigmas attached to a single pistil per flower , which is 1 or 3-4 carpellate . The ovary is 1 locular , and superior . Fruits are drupelike , with a single seed per fruit . The seeds have a minute embryo , and mealy perisperm .

In 1861 the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories were combined with Nagpur Province , which the British had annexed in 1853 , to form the Central Provinces . Lilian Jackson Braun ( born 1913 ) is an American writer , well-known for her light-hearted series of `` The Cat Who ... '' mystery novels . The `` Cat Who '' books center around the life of former newspaper reporter , James Qwilleran , and his two Siamese cats , KoKo and Yum Yum , in the fictitious small town of Pickax located in Moose County `` 400 miles north of everywhere . '' Although never formally stated in her books , the towns , counties and lifestyles described in the series are generally accepted to be modeled after Bad Axe , Michigan , where Braun resided with her husband until the mid-1980s . Lilian Jackson Braun began her writing career as a teenager , contributing sports poetry for the Detroit News . She went on to write advertising copy for many of Detroit 's department stores . For the Detroit Free Press she worked as the `` Good Living '' editor for 30 years , retiring from that post in 1978 . Between 1966 and 1968 , she published three novels to critical acclaim : The Cat Who Could Read Backwards , The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern and The Cat Who Turned On and Off . In 1966 , the New York Times labeled Braun , `` the new detective of the year . '' The rising mystery writer then disappeared from the publishing scene for 18 years . In 1986 , the Berkley Publishing Group reintroduced her work to a new generation of fans with the publication of an original paperback , The Cat Who Saw Red . Within two years , Berkley released four new novels in paperback and reprinted her first three from the sixties . Braun 's series again rose to the top of best seller lists . The twenty-ninth novel in her series , The Cat Who Had 60 Whiskers was released in hardcover by the Penguin Group in January 2007 . Little is known about Braun , who has been protective of her private life . Publishers long gave an incorrect year for her birth date , which remained unknown until she finally gave her true age during a 2005 interview with the Detroit News . Like many writers of her generation , Braun , an admitted technophobe , continues to create her fiction on a typewriter . She currently resides in North Carolina with her husband , Earl Bettinger , and their two cats .

He played 3 games in the competition . However , he was not selected for the 2002 FIFA World Cup finals as Yutaka Akita was preferred . He was transferred to Yokohama F. Marinos in 2002 and contributed to the club winning two consecutive J. League championships in 2003 and 2004 . He was selected as the Most Valuable Player of the league in 2004 . Under new national manager Zico , he partnered with Tsuneyasu Miyamoto at the back line . He participated in the 2004 AFC Asian Cup finals . He played in all the Japan matches and scored 3 goals , one of which was a stoppage time equaliser in the semi-final against Bahrain , and Japan went on to win the title again . He also played in the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany but the team failed to proceed to the knockout stage . After the tournament , he announced his retirement from the international football at the age of 28 . However , six months later , he withdrew his decision and Ivica Osim played him in a friendly against Peru on March 24 , 2007 . He played in the 2007 AFC Asian Cup finals but this time the team failed to defend the title and finished 4th in the tournament . On February 14 , 2010 Nakazawa made his 100th appearance for the Japan national team against South Korea in the final match of the 2010 East Asian Football Championship at Tokyo 's National Stadium . Nakazawa becomes only the third Japanese player , following Masami Ihara and Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi , to reach 100 caps for his country . On May 30 , 2010 Nakazawa scored an own-goal in a friendly match against England to give England the lead ; his defensive partner Tulio had already scored an own goal to draw England level with Japan . The match ended 2-1 to England . In the 2010 FIFA World Cup , Nakazawa played all 4 of Japan 's games on their way to the round of 16 and knockout by penalties to Paraguay . He played some of the best football in his entire career and alongside Marcus Tulio Tanaka was the heart of an incredible defense the quality of which is unprecedented in Asian football teams at the world cup . The progression from Group E by Japan at the 2010 FIFA World Cup was due to a large degree by Nakazawa coming out of retirement in 2007 for the Japan National Team and putting on arguably the best defensive display ever by an Asian defender at a FIFA World Cup .

The Country Music Highway runs through Prestonsburg and celebrates the region 's rich heritage of music . Country music stars including Loretta Lynn , Wynonna Judd , Naomi Judd , Billy Ray Cyrus , Tom T. Hall , Ricky Skaggs , Keith Whitley , Dwight Yoakam , and Patty Loveless are all from the Big Sandy Valley . Prestonsburg is mentioned in Yoakam 's `` Readin ' , Rightin ' , Rt . 23 '' ( from his album Hillbilly Deluxe ) , a song about the yearning of local coal miners to escape their plight by traveling up U.S. Route 23 to find employment in the factories in the North , not knowing that they were only trading one miserable life for another . Prestonsburg is the location of the Mountain Arts Center , which hosts music concerts and is home to the Kentucky Opry . Middle Creek National Battlefield is the site of the largest and most significant Civil War battle ( January 10 , 1862 ) in Eastern Kentucky .

Lead ( II ) acetate is a chemical compound , a white crystalline substance with a sweetish taste . It is made by treating lead ( II ) oxide with acetic acid . Like other lead compounds , it is toxic . Lead acetate is soluble in water and glycerin . With water it forms the trihydrate , Pb ( CH3COO ) 2 Â 3H2O , a colorless or white efflorescent monoclinic crystalline substance . Lead ( II ) acetate is also known as lead acetate , lead diacetate , plumbous acetate , sugar of lead , lead sugar , salt of Saturn , and Goulard 's powder ( after Thomas Goulard ) . The substance is used as a reagent to make other lead compounds and as a fixative for some dyes . In low concentrations , it is the principal active ingredient in progressive types of hair coloring dyes . Lead ( II ) acetate is also used as a mordant in textile printing and dyeing , as a drier in paints and varnishes , and in preparing other lead compounds . Like other lead ( II ) salts , lead acetate has a sweet taste , which has led to its use as a sugar substitute throughout history . The ancient Romans , who had few sweeteners besides honey , would boil must ( grape juice ) in lead pots to produce a reduced sugar syrup called defrutum , concentrated again into sapa . This syrup was used to sweeten wine , and to sweeten and preserve fruit . It is possible that lead acetate or other lead compounds leaching into the syrup might have caused lead poisoning in anyone consuming it . Pope Clement II died in October 1047 . A recent toxicologic examination of his remains confirmed centuries-old rumors that he had been poisoned with lead sugar . It is not clear if he was assassinated . In 1787 painter Albert Christoph Dies swallowed , by accident , three-quarters of an ounce ( 21 g ) of lead acetate . His recovery from this poison was slow and incomplete . He lived with illnesses until his death in 1822 . Although its use was already illegal at that time , composer Ludwig van Beethoven may potentially have died of lead poisoning caused by wines adulterated with lead acetate . Mary Seacole applied it among other remedies against an epidemic of cholera in Panama . Sugar of lead has also been used to treat poison ivy . Lead acetate is no longer used as a sweetener in most of the world because of its recognized toxicity . Modern chemistry can easily detect it , which has all but stopped the illegal use that continued decades after legal use was terminated . Lead acetate , as well as white lead , have been used in cosmetics throughout history , though this practice has ceased in Western countries . It is still used in men 's hair coloring products like Grecian Formula . Lead acetate paper is used to detect the poisonous gas hydrogen sulfide . The gas reacts with lead ( II ) acetate on the moistened test paper to form a gray precipitate of lead ( II ) sulfide . Lead acetate solution was a commonly used folk remedy for sore nipples . In modern medicine , for a time , it was used as an astringent , in the form of Goulard 's Extract . An aqueous solution of lead acetate is the byproduct of the 50\/50 mixture of hydrogen peroxide and white vinegar used in the cleaning and maintenance of stainless steel firearm suppressors ( silencers ) and compensators . The solution is agitated by the bubbling action of the hydrogen peroxide , and the main reaction is the dissolution of lead deposits within the suppressor by the acetic acid , which forms lead acetate . Because of its high toxicity , this chemical solution must be appropriately disposed by a chemical processing facility or hazardous materials center . Alternatively , the solution may be reacted with sulfuric acid to precipitate insoluble lead sulfate . The solid may then be removed by mechanical filtration and is safer to dispose of than aqueous lead acetate . Lead ( II ) acetate , among other lead salts , has been reported to cross the placenta and to the embryo leading to fetal mortality . Lead salts also have teratogenic effect in some animal species .
Gregory Dale Bear ( born August 20 , 1951 ) is an American science fiction and mainstream author . His work has covered themes of galactic conflict ( Forge of God books ) , artificial universes ( The Way series ) , consciousness and cultural practices ( Queen of Angels ) , and accelerated evolution ( Blood Music , Darwin 's Radio , and Darwin 's Children ) . Bear was born in San Diego , California . From 1968 to 1973 he attended San Diego State University , where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree . In 1975 , he married Christina M. Nielson , but they divorced in 1981 . He remarried in 1983 , to Astrid Anderson , the daughter of science fiction author Poul Anderson . They have two children , Erik and Alexandra . Erik is currently training in Bartitsu Cane Fighting and German Longsword on Capitol Hill . They live outside of Seattle , Washington . Bear is often classified as a hard science fiction author , based on the scientific details in his work . Bear often addresses major questions in contemporary science and culture with fictional solutions . For example , The Forge of God offers an explanation for the Fermi paradox , supposing that the galaxy is filled with potentially predatory intelligences , and that young civilizations that survive are those that do n't attract the attention of the predators -- by staying quiet . In Queen of Angels Bear examines crime , guilt and punishment in society , framing these questions around an examination of consciousness and awareness , including the emergent self-awareness of highly-advanced computers in communication with humans . In the two books Darwin 's Radio and Darwin 's Children , he addresses the problem of overpopulation , with a mutation in the human genome making , basically , a new series of humans . In the books the question of cultural acceptance of something brand new and unavoidable is also brought up . One of Bear 's favorite themes is reality as a function of observers . In Blood Music reality becomes unstable as the number of observers -- trillions of intelligent single-cell organisms -- spirals higher and higher . Both Anvil of Stars -- a sequel to The Forge of God -- and Moving Mars postulate a physics based on information exchange between particles , capable of being altered at the `` bit level . '' ( Bear has credited the inspiration for this idea to Frederick Kantor 's 1967 treatise , `` Information Mechanics . '' ) In Moving Mars this knowledge is used to remove Mars from the solar system and transfer it to an orbit around a distant star . Blood Music ( first published as a short story in 1983 , and expanded to a novel in 1985 ) has also been credited as being the first account of nanotechnology in science fiction . More certainly , the short story is the first in science fiction to describe microscopic medical machines , and to treat DNA as a computational system , capable of being reprogrammedâ '' that is , expanded and modified . In later works , beginning with Queen of Angels and continuing with its sequel , Slant , Bear gives a detailed description of a near-future nanotechnological society . This historical sequence continues with Heads -- which may contain the first description of a so-called `` quantum logic computer '' -- and with Moving Mars . This sequence also charts the historical development of self-awareness in AIs , with its continuing character , Jill , inspired in part by Robert A. Heinlein 's self-aware computer Mycroft Holmes ( `` High-Optional , Logical , Multi-Evaluating Supervisor '' ) in The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress . More recent works , such as the Darwin 's Radio \/ Darwin 's Children pair of novels , which deal with the impact of a strange disease that appears to drive evolutionary transitions , stick closely to the known facts of molecular biology of viruses and evolution . While some fairly speculative ideas are entertained , they are introduced in such a rigorous and disciplined way that Darwin 's Radio gained praise in the science journal Nature . Bear , Gregory Benford , and David Brin wrote a trilogy of prequel novels to Isaac Asimov 's famous Foundation trilogy with Bear credited for the middle book in the trilogy . While most of Bear 's work is science fiction , two of his early works , The Infinity Concerto and The Serpent Mage , which are now published together as one novel Songs of Earth and Power , are clearly fantasies , and Psychlone is horror . Dead Lines , which straddles the line between science fiction and fantasy was described by Bear as a `` high-tech ghost story . '' He has received many accolades , including five Nebula awards and two Hugo awards for science fiction .
But that is tricky when you need to have a monster destroying stuff once again . '' Tilly and the Wall is an indie pop group from Omaha , Nebraska . Their name originated from a children 's book called Tillie and the Wall , written by Leo Lionni . They are particularly noted for having a tap dancer , Jamie Pressnall , instead of a drummer . The group formed in 2001 after the demise of several Omaha groups , including Conor Oberst 's Park Ave. , of which Neely Jenkins and Jamie Pressnall ( then Jamie Williams ) were members . Jamie brought along Kianna Alarid from another band that broke up called Magic Kiss . Derek Pressnall and Nick White , natives of Dunwoody , Georgia were drawn to the music scene in Omaha , Nebraska and moved . Nick White was also one of the few constants for Bright Eyes in 2005 , appearing on I 'm Wide Awake , It 's Morning and Digital Ash in a Digital Urn , as well as touring worldwide with the band . Their first show was an open-mic night at the now defunct Ranch Bowl . Their first release , Woo ! , was recorded in Conor Oberst 's garage , self-published , and distributed at shows around the Omaha area . The group released a limited-pressing eponymous 7 '' on Rue Royale Records , followed by their debut LP , Wild Like Children in 2004 . It was the flagship release on Oberst 's Team Love label and made with the help of Presto studios . Wild Like Children garnered the band a substantial amount of critical acclaim and propelled them to national tours with Bright Eyes , Rilo Kiley , and Of Montreal . In early 2005 , Tilly and the Wall became the first `` band in residence '' at Omaha 's Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts , using the Bemis Underground 's Studio T to develop their follow-up album to Wild Like Children . In September of that year , they released `` You and I Misbehaving '' as a limited-pressing 7 '' in the UK through indie label Trash Aesthetics . This release picked up further critical acclaim as well as support from BBC radio broadcaster Steve Lamacq . They played their first show outside of the US at the Freebutt in Brighton on February 14 , 2006 . Bottoms of Barrels , the band 's follow-up to Wild Like Children , was released on May 23 , 2006 . Tilly and the Wall appeared on the Late Show With David Letterman on October 27 , 2006 , to perform `` Bad Education '' . The song was not played in full due to time constraints . A number of live dates were played to support the album . The band toured with Jenny Lewis in support of her album featuring The Watson Twins , Rabbit Fur Coat . They then went on their first headlining tour to promote Bottoms of Barrels , with acts such as David Dondero , Now It 's Overhead , and Wolf Colonel supporting them . They played the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 27 , 2007 . In addition to performing at 2007 's Splendour in the Grass festival , Tilly and the Wall toured Australia . Band members Jamie Williams and Derek Pressnall were married shortly after the album 's release , on August 12 , 2006 . On February 25 , Tilly and the Wall released a video for a new song entitled `` Beat Control '' . The digital release of the song was on March 4 , with a new album track `` Cacophony '' appearing as a b-side . `` Beat Control '' was released only as a single and was not included on the album released later in 2008 . It was also used in 90210 . o , Tilly and the Wall 's third album , was released on June 17 , 2008 . Two songs they performed on their 2007 tour , `` Too Excited '' and `` Chandelier Lake '' , appear on the album . The songs were played at their Daytrotter show . Tilly have recorded their own version of the ABC song for the new season of Sesame Street . The first single from the album is `` Pot Kettle Black '' .

Leonding is a city situated to the southwest of Linz , Austria in the state of Upper Austria . It has a population of about 22,269 ( 2001 census ) and an area of 24.05 kmÂ . It borders Puchenau and the river Danube in the north , Wilhering and Pasching in the west , Traun in the south and Linz in the east . It is very close to Linz and offers a beautiful view of the Alps and therefore attracts the upper social classes for living without providing much infrastructure on its own . Due to the proximity of Linz and the good transport connection ( like West railway , Westautobahn , B1 Wiener StraÃ e or Linz Airport ) it attracts companies like Rosenbauer , Ebner Industrieofenbau , Poloplast or Neuson .

Smash Hits was a pop music based magazine , aimed at teenagers and young adults and originally published in the United Kingdom by EMAP . It ran from 1978 to 2006 and was issued fortnightly for most of that time . The name survives as a brand for a related spin-off digital television channel , digital radio station , and website which have survived the demise of the printed magazine . Smash Hits was founded in 1978 by Nick Logan , who had previously edited the New Musical Express during one of its most creative periods and went on to create '80s fashion bible The Face . After releasing a test issue in September 1978 , with Plastic Bertrand on the front and a center spread of Sham 69 , the first issue was published in November 1978 and featured Blondie on the cover . The publication was initially monthly but switched to fortnightly after only three issues , which it remained until its demise . The backbone of the magazine in its early years , and one of its major early selling points , was the publication of Top 20 song lyrics . The magazine was at its peak in the 1980s , launching the career of many journalists including Heat 's editor Mark Frith . Other well-known writers have included Dave Rimmer , Ian Birch , Mark Ellen ( who went on to launch Q , Mojo and Word ) , Steve Beebee , Peter Martin , Chris Heath , Sylvia Patterson , Tom Hibbert , and Miranda Sawyer . Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys also worked as a writer and assistant editor , and once claimed that had he not become a pop star , he would likely have pursued his ambition to become editor . In the 1990s the magazine 's circulation slumped and it was overtaken by the BBC 's spin off magazine Top Of The Pops . Emap 's other biweekly teen magazine of the period Big ! ( which featured more celebrities and stars of TV programs like Home And Away and Beverly Hills , 90210 ) was closed and this celeb focus was shifted over to Smash Hits , which became less focused on Teenpop and more of an Entertainment magazine . The magazine also shifted size a number of times in subsequent relaunches including one format that was as big as an album with songwords to be clipped out on the card cover . Television presenter and journalist Kate Thornton was editor for a short time . The magazine was also available in Continental Europe , especially in Germany where the issues could be bought at train stations or airports , whilst the title was licensed for a French version in the 90s . There were other licensed versions in the magazine 's history . In 1984 an Australian version was created and proved just as successful for that new market as the original had back in Britain , whilst in the US , a version was published during the Eighties under the title Star Hits , drawing articles from the British version . It was published by Emap , who also use the name for one of their digital television services , and for a digital radio station . The brand also covered the annual Smash Hits Poll Winners Party , an awards ceremony voted for by readers of the magazine . In February 2006 , it was announced that the magazine would cease publication after the 13 February edition due to declining sales . The digital television , digital radio , and website services will continue . In July 2009 a one-off commemorative issue of the magazine was published as a tribute to singer Michael Jackson . Further one-off specials were released in November 2009 ( Take That ) and December 2010 ( Lady Gaga ) . EMAP licensed the brand for a number of compilation albums , including a tie in with the Now That 's What I Call Music brand for Now Smash Hits , a retrospective of the early 1980s ( 80 - 87 ) . The Australian edition of Smash Hits magazine began in November 1984 as a fortnightly edited by James Manning . The magazine blended some content from the parent publication with locally generated material . Eddy Sarafian , who was later to edit the successful competitor TV Hits for Attic Futura Publications , was also on staff at the time the magazine was founded . Robyn Doreian , later editor of Attic Futura 's Hot Metal was graphic designer for Smash Hits and in the early 1990s Lisa Anthony , formerly editor of Attic Futura 's Hit Songwords , would become Smash Hits editor for a brief period . Australian Smash Hits was originally published by Fairfax Magazines and was later purchased by Mason Stewart Publications . Over the years it became a monthly and then a bi-monthly . In 2007 the magazine retailed for A$ 5.95 Inc. . GST and NZ$ 6.50 . On March 30 , 2007 it was announced that the Australian edition would cease publication due to low readership . The editor at that time was Emma Bradshaw . The issue that was scheduled to be released on May 9 , 2007 was canceled .

The M postcode area , also known as the Manchester postcode area , is a group of several postcode districts in Greater Manchester , England . The area is divided into three post towns : Manchester , Salford , and Sale . The Manchester post town forms most of the area , and the other two post towns are enclaves within it . It includes parts of all Greater Manchester boroughs except for Stockport . The entirety of the metropolitan district of the City of Manchester itself is included within the area , except for Ringway , which is in WA15 . The postcode area also includes nearly all of the City of Salford and most of the borough of Trafford . Note : The original M10 postcode is obsolete , having been re-coded as M40 in 1993 . Sometimes on Coronation Street they quote M10 as their postcode , for example on November 5th 2010 Kevin Webster quoted the postcode for the Garage as M10 9KC . Before the introduction of postcodes in the 1960s , Manchester along with other major cities like Birmingham , Liverpool and Sheffield was divided into numbered postcode districts . With a few exceptions these were directly incorporated into the outcode ( the first part of the postcode ) . The districts were based on Manchester and Salford together and districts outside the city boundaries were also included . For example , the City Centre had postcode districts 1 - 4 ( north-east , south , west and north-west respectively : Manchester 1 was around Piccadilly and 4 was around Victoria ) . 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 were in Salford and then the sequence continued across north Manchester and so round to M17 ( Trafford Park ) . M18 onwards were further out still .

Braine-l ` Alleud is a Walloon municipality located in the Belgian province of Walloon Brabant , about 20 kilometers south of Brussels . The Braine-l ` Alleud municipality includes the former municipalities of Braine-l ` Alleud proper , Ophain-Bois-Seigneur-Isaac , and Lillois-Witterz Ã e. It also includes the hamlet of Sart-Moulin , the inverted name of which inspired HergÃ â s Moulinsart castle . The famous Lion of Waterloo is actually located on the territory of Braine-l ` Alleud . Bordering Flanders , the town is home to a minority of Dutch-speakers . Several archaeological finds point to prehistoric settlements in this area . The first historical mention of a parish on Braine-l ` Alleud 's current territory , then called Dudinsart , dates from 1131 , date at which Godfrey I , Duke of Brabant ceded it to the Abbey of Gembloux . The Duke , however , still owned exempt land ( or franchise ) on this territory , as specified in a legal document by Henry I dated 1197 . The name of the municipality changed to the current one , derived from â Braineâ , former name of the stream that crosses its territory ( now called the â Hainâ ) , and â alleuâ , a medieval French word designating exempt land . The latter name was added to the former to distinguish this community from two neighbouring ones also called Braine . At the beginning , the franchise might not have been much more than a right to local administration . By 1489 , however , the local lord enjoyed complete juridical power on its territory , which was still formally part of the fiefdom obtained from the Duke of Brabant . In 1815 , part of the fighting that took place at the Battle of Waterloo actually occurred on the territory of Braine-l â Alleud . The townâ s church of Saint-Etienne became a field hospital .

Bourg-en-Bresse ( ; BÃ rg in Arpitan language ) is a commune in eastern France , capital of the Ain department , and was capital of the former province of Bresse ( BrÃ sse ) . It is located 70 k north-northeast of Lyon . The inhabitants of Bourg-en-Bresse are known as Burgiens . Bourg-en-Bresse is located at the western base of the Jura mountains , on the left bank of the Reyssouze , a tributary of the SaÃ ne . It lies 70 k northeast of Lyon and at 50 k of Lons-le-Saunier . Roman remains have been discovered at Bourg , but little is known of its early history . Raised to the rank of a free town in 1250 , it was at the beginning of the 15th century chosen by the dukes of Savoy as the chief city of the province of Bresse . In February 1535 â '' 1536 new styleâ '' it passed to France , during a full-scale French invasion of Savoy , but was restored to Duke Philibert Emmanuel in 1559 , when he married Henri II 's sister Marguerite . The Duke later built a strong citadel , which afterwards withstood a six-months ' siege by the soldiers of Henry IV . The town was finally ceded to France in 1601 . In 1814 the inhabitants , in spite of the defenseless condition of their town , offered resistance to the Austrians , who put the place to pillage . The chief of the older buildings is the church of Notre-Dame ( CathÃ drale Notre-Dame-de-l ` Annonciation de Bourg-en-Bresse ) ( 16th century ) , of which the faÃ ade belongs to the Renaissance ; other parts of the church are Gothic . In the interior there are stalls of the 16th century . The other public buildings , including a handsome prÃ fecture , are modern . The hÃ tel de ville contains a library and the Lorin museum with a collection of pictures , while another museum has a collection of the old costumes and ornaments characteristic of Bresse . Among the statues in the town there is one of Edgar Quinet ( 1803 â `` 1875 ) , a native of Bourg . The church of Brou , a suburb of Bourg-en-Bresse , is of great artistic interest . Marguerite of Bourbon , wife of Philip II of Savoy , had intended to found a monastery on the spot , but died before her intention could be carried into effect . The church was actually built early in the 16th century by her daughter-in-law Marguerite of Austria , wife of Philibert le Beau of Savoy , in memory of her husband . The exterior , especially the faÃ ade , is richly ornamented , but the chief interest lies in the works of art in the interior , which date from 1532 . The most important are the three mausoleums with the marble effigies of Marguerite of Bourbon , Philibert le Beau , and Marguerite of Austria . All three are remarkable for perfection of sculpture and richness of ornamentation . The rood loft , the oak stalls , and the reredos in the chapel of the Virgin are masterpieces in a similar style . The manufactures consist of iron goods , mineral waters , tallow , soap and earthenware , and there are flour mills and breweries ; and there is considerable trade in grain , cattle and poultry - Poulet de Bresse . The Gare de Bourg-en-Bresse railway station offers connections to Paris , Strasbourg , Lyon and Geneva by high speed rail , and several regional destinations . The A39 motorway connects Bourg with Dole and Dijon , the A40 with MÃ cents con and Geneva . Bourg is the seat of a prefect and of a court of assizes , and has a tribunal of first instance , a tribunal and a chamber of commerce , and a branch of the Bank of France . Its educational establishments include lycÃ es , and training collÃ ges . Bourg-en-Bresse was the finish of Stage 6 and the departure of Stage 7 in the 2007 Tour de France . The Bourg Walk is a name of a bridge in Aylesbury , dedicated to the twin town . Former resident and past pupil of Aylesbury Grammar School , Alastair Harrison proposed the name to symbolically bridge the gap between the two towns , which has been received most favourably .

In August 2009 , after a mediocre season individually , Angulo was released by Valencia , thus ending a 14-year relationship . Late in the same month , he agreed to a one-year contract with Sporting Clube de Portugal , but after just four months , he was released by the Lisbon club , grossly unsettled , and pondered his retirement , which was confirmed the following week . Angulo made his debut for Spain on November 17 , 2004 , in a friendly match against England played in Madrid ( 1 â `` 0 win ) . Going on to collect 11 caps , he never took part in any major competition 's final stages , however .

A permanganate is the general name for Mercadante and a chemical compound also known as ethanol containing the manganate ( VII ) ion , ( MnO4 â ' ) . Because manganese is in the +7 oxidation state , the permanganate ( VII ) ion is a strong oxidizing agent . The ion has tetrahedral geometry . Permanganate solutions are purple in color and are stable in neutral or slightly alkaline media . In an acidic solution , permanganate ( VII ) is reduced to the colourless +2 oxidation state of the manganese ( II ) ( Mn2 + ) ion . In a strongly basic solution , permanganate ( VII ) is either reduced to the brown +4 oxidation state of manganese dioxide MnO2 or to the green +6 oxidation state of the manganate MnO42 â ' . Permanganates ( VII ) are salts of permanganic acid . Permanganate ( VII ) is a strong oxidizer , and similar to perchlorate . It is therefore in common use in qualitative analysis that involves redox reactions ( permanganometry ) . Besides this , it is stable . It is a useful reagent , though with organic compounds , not very selective . Manganates ( VII ) are not very stable thermally . For instance , potassium permanganate decomposes at 230 Â C to potassium manganate and manganese dioxide , releasing oxygen gas : A permanganate can oxidize an amine to a nitro compound , an alcohol to a ketone , an aldehyde to a carboxylic acid , a terminal alkene to a carboxylic acid , oxalic acid to carbon dioxide , and an alkene to a diol .

NestlÃ 's flagship powdered coffee product was introduced in Switzerland on April 1 , 1938 after being developed for seven years by Max Morgenthaler and Vernon Chapman . NestlÃ claims that 3,000 cups of NescafÃ are drunk every second . NescafÃ is a brand within NestlÃ . NescafÃ can be traced back to the 1930s . In the US , the NescafÃ name was used on its products up until the 1960s , Later , NestlÃ ( owners of the NescafÃ brand ) introduced a new brand in the United States called Taster 's Choice , which supplanted NescafÃ for many years . In the United Kingdom , a television advertisement campaign starring Anthony Head and Sharon Maughan ran in 12 instalments between 1987 and 1993 . The first 11 episodes were released as a promotional compilation video called Love Over Gold in 1993 . A novelisation of the same name written by Susan Moody ( under the pseudonym Susannah James ) was released in the same year . In 2003 , the company reintroduced the NescafÃ brand in the US , and the product is now known as NescafÃ Taster 's Choice . It is sold in US supermarkets such as Safeway in both glass and plastic packaging . While the NescafÃ brand was created for soluble coffee , it has subsequently been used as an umbrella brand on a number of instant coffee products , including , in the UK , Gold Blend and Blend 37 freeze-dried coffees . In 2006 , NescafÃ launched the new coffee machine system `` Dolce Gusto '' ( `` sweet taste '' in Italian ) . The system allows consumers to make various styles of coffees themselves ( Cappuccino , Latte Macchiato , Espresso , Lungo , etc. ) . Additionally , hot chocolate and cold drinks can be prepared with the machine . The machines are now sold in more than 15 countries worldwide .

The $ 15.6 million judgment was subsequently reversed in its entirety by the California Court of Appeal . On October 31 , 2007 The California Supreme Court , with a vote of 6-0 , granted review . English band Muse successfully sued NescafÃ in 2003 when its song `` Feeling Good '' was used in a television advert without permission , donating the Â # 500,000 compensation to Oxfam .
Rice wine is an alcoholic beverage made from rice . Unlike wine , which is made by fermentation of naturally sweet grapes and other fruit , rice `` wine '' results from the fermentation of rice starch converted to sugars . This process is akin to that used to produce beer ; however , beer production employs a mashing process to convert starch to sugars whereas rice wine uses the different amylolytic process . Alcoholic beverages distilled from rice were exclusive to East and Southeast Asian countries , with knowledge of the distillation process reaching India and parts of South Asia later through trade . Rice brew typically has a higher alcohol content ( 18 â `` 25 % ) than wine ( 10 â `` 20 % ) , which in turn has a higher alcohol content than beer ( 3 â `` 8 % ) . Rice wine features prominently in Chinese and other East Asian cuisines . A substitute for rice wine is dry pale sherry .
Sap is a fluid transported in xylem cells ( tracheids or vessel elements ) or phloem sieve tube elements of a plant . It transports water and nutrients throughout the plant . Fluid found in the vacuoles of other cells is sometimes referred to as `` cell sap '' . Other liquid compounds found in plants or exuded by plants , such as latex , resins or mucilage , are sometimes incorrectly referred to as sap . Xylem sap consists primarily of water , with hormones , mineral elements and other nutrients dissolved in it . Transport of sap in xylemis generally `` acropetal '' , or upward from the roots toward the leaves . Over the past century , there has been some controversy regarding the mechanism of xylem sap transport ; today , most plant scientists agree that the cohesion-tension theory best explains this process . Phloem sap consists primarily of water , with sugars , hormones , and mineral elements dissolved in it . It flows from where carbohydrates are produced or stored to where they are used . The pressure flow hypothesis proposes a mechanism for phloem sap transport . Maple syrup is made from reduced sugar maple xylem sap . In some countries ( e.g. , Russia , Latvia , Estonia or Finland ) it is common to collect the early spring sap of birch trees ( so called `` birch juice '' ) for human consumption ; the sap can be used fresh or fermented and contains xylitol .

Pescia is an Italian city in the province of Pistoia , Tuscany , central Italy . It is located in a central zone between the cities Lucca and Florence , on the banks of the homonymous river . Archaeological excavations have suggested that the Lombards built here a first settlement on the river banks . The name of the city comes in fact from a Lombard word , meaning `` river '' . Lucca occupied and destroyed Pescia during the 13th century , but the town was quickly rebuilt . During the entire Middle Ages Florence and Lucca contended for the city , as the latter was located on the border between the two republics . In 1339 , after almost ten years of war , Florence occupied it . The economy of the town was founded on mulberry cultivation and silkworm breeding . Heavily struck by the Black Death , Pescia overcame the demographic and economical depression which had ensued only at the end of that century ( 15th century ) . At the end of 17th century the Grand-duke of Tuscany declared Pescia `` City of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany '' . In the 19th century the silk production was so important that Pescia was called `` the little Manchester of Tuscany '' . The economy of the town dropped after a commercial conflict between France and Italy ( 1888 ) . The passage of Napoleon highly damaged the economy of the city , because he substituted silk with sugar beet . Since 1925 Pesciatins found an alternative economic source in cultivating and trading flowers and olive plants ( since the end of the 19th century ) . Bombardaments during World War II highly damaged Pescia . Economic activities in and around the city include flower growing ( carnations , for which it is an international market center ) and paper production . The city is home of three professional ( economics , agrarian and graphic-touristic ) high schools and four cultural ( classical , scientific , linguistic and psycho-pedagogic ) high schools .

In modern usage , an orgy is a sex party where guests engage in promiscuous or multifarious sexual activity or group sex . An orgy differs from some swinger 's parties by the fact that couples at many swingers party engage in twosome and otherwise conventional sexual activities , though not with their permanent sexual partner . An orgy is actually like other kinds of swingers parties in that couples at some swingers party engage in sex with various other partners as well as just swapping partners . In ancient Greek religion , an orgy ( á 1\/2 Ï Î Î Î Î 1\/2 , pl . á 1\/2 Ï Î Î Î ) was a secret nighttime cultic congregation overseen by an orgiophant ( a teacher or revealer of secret rites popularly thought to involve sex ) , celebrated with dancing , drunkenness , singing , etc. ( See Bacchanalia and Saturnalia . ) An orgion was a secret rite of the Greek mystery religions , practiced in the worship of Demeter at Eleusis ( mentioned in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter ) or in worship of Dionysus ( Herodotus 2.81 ) , the Cabeiri , Demeter Achaia ( Herodotus 2.51 , 5.61 ) , Orpheus , Eumolpus , or Cybele .

Akita Prefecture is a prefecture of Japan located in the TÅ hoku Region of northern HonshÅ `` , the main island of Japan . The capital is the city of Akita . Separated from the principal Japanese centres of commerce , politics , and population by several hundred kilometres and the Å u and Dewa mountain ranges to the east , Akita remained largely isolated from Japanese society until after the year 600 . Akita was a region of hunter-gatherers and principally nomadic tribes . The first historical record of what is now Akita Prefecture dates to 658 , when the Abe no Hirafu conquered the native Ezo tribes at what are now the cities of Akita and Noshiro . Hirafu , then governor of Koshi Province ( the northwest part of HonshÅ `` bordering the Sea of Japan ) , established a fort on the Mogami River , and thus began the Japanese settlement of the region . In 733 , a new military settlementâ '' later renamed Akita Castleâ '' was built in modern-day Akita city at Takashimizu , and more permanent roads and structures were developed . The region was used as a base of operations for the Japanese empire as it drove the native Ezo people from northern HonshÅ `` . It shifted hands several times . During the Tokugawa shogunate it was appropriated to the Satake clan , who ruled the region for 260 years , developing the agriculture and mining industries that are still predominant today . Throughout this period , it was classified as part of Dewa Province and remained politically quite stable . In 1871 , during the Meiji Restoration , Dewa Province was reshaped and the old daimyo domains were abolished and administratively reconstructed , resulting in the modern-day borders of Akita . The famous Heian period waka poet , Ono no Komachi , is said to have been born in Yuzawa City , Ogachi Town , located in the southeast of the prefecture . Located in the north of HonshÅ `` , Akita Prefecture faces the Sea of Japan in the west and is bordered by four other prefectures : Aomori in the north , Iwate in the east , Miyagi in the southeast , and Yamagata in the south . Akita Prefecture is rectangular in shape , roughly 181 km from north to south and 111 km from west to east . The Å u Mountains mark the eastern border of the prefecture , and the higher Dewa Mountains run parallel through the center of the prefecture . Like much of northern Japan , the prefecture has cold winters , particularly away from the sea . The Oga Peninsula is a prominent feature of the coastline . These are all of the towns and villages in each district . Like much of the TÅ hoku Region , Akita 's economy remains dominated by traditional industries , such as agriculture , fishing , and forestry . This has led many young people to migrate to Tokyo and other large cities . Akita Prefecture is where declines in population are most severe in Japan ; it is one of four prefectures in Japan registering declines in population since 1945 . It also has the lowest number of children as a percentage of the population , at 11.2 % . As of 2010 , it has a population of just over 1 million people . Akita is famous for rice farming and its sake breweries . It is well-known for having the highest consumption of sake in Japan , and thought to be the origin of the Akita breed of dog which carries the prefecture 's name . The women of the region , referred to as Akita bijin , have also gained widespread renown for their white skin , rounded faces and high voices , all of which are considered highly desirable . Ono no Komachi is a famous example of an Akita bijin . Near Lake Tazawa , there are a number of hot springs resorts ( onsen ) . These are popular with tourists from all over Japan . In addition , its numerous seasonal festivals ( matsuri ) offer a glimpse of rural or traditional Japan . Some famous examples are the Akita KantÅ , the Omagari Fireworks , Namahage Festival , and the Yokote Kamakura Festivals . Kakunodate is a particularly charming old town , known as the little Kyoto , full of preserved samurai houses . The Aoyagi house is the former residence of Odano Naotake , the man who illustrated Japan 's first modern guide to the human anatomy . The house is now a museum and gallery of medical illustrations and traditional crafts . Starting in 2009 , Akita began experiencing a huge surge in Korean tourism after the airing of the popular drama Iris , which featured several scenes shot in Akita , most notably at Lake Tazawa and Oga 's GAO Aquarium .
The Lancia Lybra is a compact executive car produced by Italian Fiat Auto 's upscale marque Lancia between 1999 and 2006 . Based on heavily modified Alfa Romeo 156 floorpan , it replaced the Dedra within Lancia 's lineup , and was similarly low-profile to its predecessor , rather than as popular as its Alfa sibling . Just like the Dedra , the Lybra is available as both a saloon and estate ( billed SW by Lancia ) The model 's name can be seen as a reference to the zodiac sign of Libra that was derived from the Latin word for balancing scale . It signals an end of the previous Lancia naming theme involving the use of Greek letters as model names . The Lybra was built in the Rivalta plant near Turin until 2002 and after that in Mirafiori plant in Turin . The Lybra was styled in Centro Stile Lancia , contrary to earlier Lancia models , which were commissioned from external design studios . Its styling is a clear departure from `` rectangular '' shapes prevalent in 1980s and 1990s Lancias , using heritage-inspired round headlights and other styling touches inspired by Lancias of the 1950s , like the Aurelia and Appia . On the other hand , it was n't as edgy as the Lancia Thesis and later models , and still carried many references to 1990s Lancias , such as the shape of the grille , or the treatment of the upper body section of the wagon ( reminiscent of that of the Lancia Kappa SW ) . Interestingly , the Lybra 's very distinctive taillights were borrowed for the 2001 's facelift given to the Fiat Marea sedan for the Latin American markets . Lancia Lybra is a front-wheel drive car with transversely-mounted engines . The Lybra is available with a 5-speed manual , and the 2.0 L had an option of a 4-speed automatic transmission , called the Comfortronic by Lancia .
Lew Ljewitsch `` Leo '' Borchard ( March 31 , 1899 -- August 23 , 1945 ) was a Russian conductor and briefly musical director of the Berlin Philharmonic . He was born in Moscow to German parents , and grew up in Saint Petersburg where he received a solid musical education , as well being a regular visitor to the Stanislavsky theater . In 1920 , after the Russian Revolution , he emigrated to Germany . Otto Klemperer engaged him as his assistant at the Kroll Opera in Berlin ( Klemperer , lacking confidence in his own abilities , expected Borchard to critique his conducting technique ) . He conducted the Berlin Philharmonic for the first time in January 1933 . In 1935 , he was banned by the Nazi regime as politically unreliable . He continued teaching at his apartment and received his friends including Boris Blacher and Gottfried von Einem . During World War II he was a Resistance activist , ( name : Andrik Krassnow ) , remaining in Berlin , during which time his duties included contact with Ludwig Lichtwitz , a specialist in false identity papers . On 26 May 1945 , two and a half weeks after Germany 's unconditional surrender , he conducted the Berlin Philharmonic in a concert featuring the Overture to Mendelssohn 's Midsummer Night 's Dream , Mozart 's Violin Concerto in A major and Tchaikovsky 's Symphony No. 4 to great public acclaim at the Titania Palast cinema . One week later he was appointed musical director of the orchestra by the Soviet official Nikolai Bersarin , replacing Wilhelm FurtwÃ ngler who was in exile in Switzerland . His anti-Nazi credentials and command of the Russian language enabled him to enjoy a close relationship with the occupiers . He gave 22 concerts in total as chief conductor of the BPO . Borchard was killed while being driven home after a concert on 23 August 1945 . His British driver misinterpreted an American sentry 's hand signal to stop and the sentry shot him dead . The British driver and Borchard 's partner Ruth Andreas-Friedrich survived . As a result of this incident , it was decided to mark military checkpoints more prominently so that hand signals were not required . On 5 and 6 September 1995 Claudio Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic marked the anniversary of Borchard 's death with performances of Mahler 's 6th Symphony .

Eduardo GonÃ alves de Andrade ( born 25 January 1947 ) , better known as TostÃ # o , is a former Brazilian footballer , who played as a forward . In his prime , he was considered one of the best offensive players in the world , while also contributing with many assists thanks to his passing abilities . Born in Belo Horizonte , Minas Gerais , Eduardo Andrade received , like the vast majority of Brazilian footballers , a nickname early into his football career , being dubbed ` TostÃ # o ' ( little coin ) . Legend has it that as a six-year old school boy he netted 47 goals in one game for his primary school football team . TostÃ # o made his professional debuts aged only 15 , for local AmÃ rica Futebol Clube ( MG ) , returning after two years to Cruzeiro Esporte Clube , where he had started his youth career . Not a pure striker , he was crowned the Campeonato Mineiros topscorer on three consecutive occasions , the first in 1966 , and left the club as its all-time scorer , with a total of 242 league goals . In the 1970 FIFA World Cup , TostÃ # o scored two of his 32 goals for Brazil , as the national team won its third trophy , whilst finding the net on 19 occasions . The previous year , after being hit in the face by a ball during a match against Sport Club Corinthians Paulista , he suffered a detached retina from which he never fully recovered . In April 1972 , he signed for CR Vasco da Gama for a then record fee in the country but , after good overall displays , was forced to retire from the game at only 27 , after his sight problems resurfaced . Weary of football and fame , TostÃ # o became a medical doctor , but ultimately rejoined the footballing world , working as a journalist and pundit on TV .
Stefan Effenberg ( born 2 August 1968 ) is a retired German footballer . A central midfielder , he possessed leadership skills , powerful shooting ability , physical strength , but also a fearsome and controversial character . In the German first division alone â `` where he represented most notably Bayern Munich , in six seasons in two different spells â `` Effenberg collected 109 yellow cards , an all-time worst at the time of his retirement . He played for Germany on more than 30 occasions â `` in a career which was cut short after a run-in with the management â `` representing the nation in one World Cup and one European Championship . Born in Niendorf , Hamburg , Effenberg started his professional career with Borussia MÃ nchengladbach , being an undisputed first-choice by age 20 . This prompted the interest from Bundesliga giants FC Bayern Munich , and he proceeded to score 19 goals in his first two seasons combined , but the club did not win any silverware whatsoever . After legendary Lothar MatthÃ us ( who also represented M ` gladbach ) returned to Bayern in 1992 , Effenberg moved to ACF Fiorentina , being relegated from Serie A in his first season , on a side that also included Dane Brian Laudrup and Argentine Gabriel Batistuta . Effenberg then moved again to Borussia , where he amassed a further 118 league matches , with 23 goals , being then re-signed by Bayern . The second spell with the Bavarians was much more successful , as he collected three leagues in a row , and also the 2000 â `` 01 UEFA Champions League , scoring in regulation period from the penalty spot in a triumph against Valencia CF ( 1 â `` 1 , penalty shootout win ) . During the latter tournament , he also won the Most Valuable Player award . After his departure , club fans voted him one of the eleven greatest Bayern players of all time . After an unassuming spell at VfL Wolfsburg , Effenberg ended his career in Qatar with Al-Arabi Sports Club . Subsequently , he had the odd appearance as a color commentator for German TV . Effenberg played 35 games for the German national team and scored five goals . His debut came on 5 June 1991 , in a Euro 1992 qualifier against Wales , as he played the last 18 minutes of a 0 â `` 1 away loss . He would be an everpresent fixture during the final stages , even netting in the second group stage match , a 2 â `` 0 win over Scotland . However , Effenberg 's international career was marked by controversy and several years in the international wilderness , after the German Football Association refused to consider him for selection following an incident at the 1994 FIFA World Cup . In the group game against South Korea , Effenberg had gestured in an inappropriate manner ( `` gave the finger '' ) to fans at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas when he got substituted after a subpar performance ; the Germans were then only one goal up , after leading 3 â `` 0 . Because of this incident , coach Berti Vogts decided to drop Effenberg from the German national team for the remainder of the tournament . Effenberg was briefly re-instated to the national team four years later for a couple of friendly matches in September . These games proved to be his last caps and also Vogts ' final matches in charge of the national team . Germany 's goal tally first : Effenberg had a history of attracting attention and ire from fans and other players alike with his behavior . In 1991 , prior to a UEFA Cup game against then-semi-professional Cork City , Effenberg told the press he was sure of a victory , saying Cork City midfielder Dave Barry was `` like ( his ) grandfather '' . Barry got his retribution by scoring the opening goal in the team 's 1 â `` 1 draw at Musgrave Park . In the late 1990s , Effenberg was rarely out of the tabloids , especially when he left his wife Martina and revealed an affair with Claudia Strunz , who at that time was the wife of former team mate Thomas Strunz . Later , the player published a controversial autobiography , notorious for its blatant contents â `` which included lashing out at some other football professionals , namely club and national side mate MatthÃ us . In 2001 , Effenberg was fined after being found guilty of assaulting a woman in a nightclub . The following year , he implied that unemployed people in Germany were in fact too lazy to look for work , and demanded they took benefit cuts . The interview issued in Playboy . Strunz and Effenberg were married in 2004 , and the player also had three children from his first marriage ; the couple then relocated to Florida .

A rival is a person , team , company , or other organization competing against another person or team , etc. A seneschal ( Ë sÉ nÉ Ê É l ) was an officer in the houses of important nobles in the Middle Ages . In the French administrative system of the Middle Ages , the sÃ nÃ chal was also a royal officer in charge of justice and control of the administration in southern provinces , equivalent to the northern French bailli . It is equivalent to Slavic stolnik . The word is recorded in English since 1393 , deriving via Old French seneschal , from Frankish Latin siniscalcus , itself from Proto-Germanic roots sini - ( `` senior '' ) and skalk ( `` servant '' , as in marshal ) . The most basic function of a seneschal was to supervise feasts and domestic ceremonies ; in this respect , they were equivalent to stewards and majordomos . Sometimes , seneschals were given additional responsibilities , including the dispensing of justice and high military command . The term is probably of Gothic origin . In the Holy Roman Empire this officer had the title Drussard , or Truchsess ( from Old High German truhtsÃ cents zo ; `` sitting in front of '' the truht , the `` Tross '' ; Latin Dapifer , French Ã cuyer de cuisine , Dutch Drossaard , Drost , Baljuw , Swedish Drots ) . Under the Ancien RÃ gime in southern France , the sÃ nÃ chal was the king 's representative charged with the application of justice and control of administration in the sÃ nÃ chaussÃ e ( administrative district ) . In northern France , the terms used were bailli and bailliage ( bailiwick ) . According to historian Henry Hallam , the first sÃ nÃ chaux to receive judicial functions did so by an edict of Philip II of France in 1190 , and `` acted as the king 's lieutenants in his domains '' , or a sort of roving ambassadors or ministers for the throne .

The triple jump ( sometimes referred to as the hop , step and jump or the hop , skip and jump ) is a track and field sport , similar to the long jump , but involving a â hop , step and jumpâ routine , whereby the competitor runs down the track and performs a hop , a step and then a jump into the sand pit . The triple jump has its origins in the Ancient Olympics and has been a modern Olympics event since the Gamesâ inception in 1896 . The current male and female world record holders are Jonathan Edwards of Great Britain , with a jump of 18.29 m , and Inessa Kravets of Ukraine , with a jump of 15.50 m ( 50 ft. 10.25 in . ) . The triple jump , or at least a variant involving three jumps one after the other , has its roots in the Ancient Greek Olympics , with records showing athletes attaining distances of more than 50 feet ( 15.24 m ) . In Irish mythology the geal-ruith ( triple jump ) , was an event contested in the ancient Irish Tailteann Games as early as 1829 B.C. The triple jump was a part of the inaugural 1896 Olympics in Athens , although back then it consisted of two hops on the same foot and then a jump . In fact , the first modern Olympic champion , James Connolly , was a triple jumper . Early Olympics also included the standing triple jump , although this has since been removed from the Olympic program and is rarely performed in competition today . The womenâ s triple jump was introduced into the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 . The athlete sprints down a runway until they reach a takeoff mark , from which the jump is measured . The takeoff mark is a board which is commonly implemented as a physical piece of wood or similar material embedded in the runway , or a rectangle painted on the runway surface . In modern championships a strip of plasticine , tape , or modeling clay is attached to the board to record athletes overstepping or `` scratching '' the mark , defined by the trailing edge of the board . There are three phases of the triple jump , articulated in the original event name : the `` hop '' phase , the `` step '' phase , and the `` jump '' phase . These three phases are executed in one continuous sequence . The hop starts with the athlete jumping from the mark on his\/her takeoff leg , and ends landing heel first on the runway with the takeoff leg . The hop appears to be more of a `` cycling '' movement . The objective is to hop out as opposed to up . In the step , the athlete immediately jumps with the takeoff leg and lands on the runway with the opposite leg . The objective of the step is to cover as much runway as possible so one is as close to the pit as possible for the next phase . The step is followed by the jump , where the athlete jumps from that same non-takeoff leg and lands in a sand-filled pit . The jump phase is very similar to the long jump . In the long jump process , an athlete must hit the mark with his\/her take off leg bringing the opposite leg bent and straight up ; both legs must come in front of the athlete when landing inside the sand-filled pit . Every phase of the triple jump should get progressively higher . However , in both events if the athlete 's takeoff foot lands in front of the board then , the athlete fouls . A `` foul '' , also known as a `` scratch '' or missed jump , occurs when a jumper oversteps the takeoff mark , misses the pit entirely , does not use the correct foot sequences throughout the phases , or does not perform the attempt in the allotted amount of time ( usually about one minute ) . When a jumper `` scratches , '' the seated official will raise a red flag and the jumper who was `` on deck , '' or up next , prepares to jump . To record a `` scratch , '' a video camera is commonly used to avoid confusion and unfair calls . Accurate as of June 12 , 2010 . ; Outdoor NB : These are the top 10 performers of all time , not the top 10 performances . Other legal jumps by people on this list that would exceed the shortest jump on this list are noted below the table . NB : Again , these are the top 10 performers of all time , not the top 10 performances .

His early career was spent in the Cuban leagues , including Villa Clara of the Serie Nacional .

He was named one of the top fielders in baseball in a online fan 's poll . In 2007 , he made many good fielding plays . However , he suffered through spells of throwing wildness that season . Bad throws accounted for most of his 18 errors in the first half of , almost as many as his total of 20 . He turned things around and made only 5 errors in the second half of 2007 . His defense suffered in , with several fielding metrics calling him one of the worst shortstops in baseball . Betancourt has been a poor hitter with some gap power who rarely strikes out or walks . He has been criticized for his lack of plate discipline and inability to bunt . In 2006 , he walked only 3.0 % of the time , the second-worst percentage in major league baseball . However , he only struck out 9.7 % of the time , one of the top 20 percentages . Betancourt was among the league leaders in batting with runners in scoring position and game-winning RBI in 2007 . In a late season game in 2007 , former Mariner Mike Blowers referred to Betancourt as being `` unreal '' when batting with runners on in close late games-a result at odds with his career statistics . He hit his first grand slam in a 7-6 win against the Chicago White Sox on August 11 , 2007 . In 2008 , he again walked only 3.0 % of the time , the worst percentage in Major League Baseball . His strikeout rate dropped to 7.5 % . He also saw the fewest pitches per plate appearance of all major leaguers , 3.15 . On July 10 , 2009 , he was acquired by the Kansas City Royals along with a portion of his salary for Minor League pitchers Derrick Saito and Dan Cortes . In 2009 , he had the lowest on base percentage of any starter in the major leagues , at .274 , and the lowest slugging percentage in the American League with .351 . In 2010 , he hit an opening day home run off Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander , and went on to finish the season with a career-high 16 home runs . Many of his other statistics , including his batting average , on base percentage , and fielding percentage , increased slightly from his 2009 numbers . On December 19 , 2010 , Betancourt was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers along with teammate Zack Greinke and USD$ 2,000,000 , reportedly to offset the buyout of Betancourt 's club option in 2012 , for Alcides Escobar , Lorenzo Cain , Jeremy Jeffress , and Jake Odorizzi .

Famous as a hard-working forward , he used to strike from outside the penalty area with his surging runs goalwards and was not the traditional center-forward operating solely inside the box .

Kempes had been the top scorer in La Liga in each of the past two seasons and was determined to show on home soil that he could deliver against the best on the sport 's greatest stage as well . However , in 1974 , at the age of 20 , he failed to get on the score-sheet in West Germany and after the first round group stage in 1978 , his name was still missing among goal scorers in the tournament . During his club career he won 43 caps for Argentina and scored 20 times . He represented his country in three World Cups in 1974 , 1978 and 1982 , winning the competition in 1978 . He was the leading goalscorer in the 1978 tournament , scoring six goals , including two in the final itself . He has also scored some very important goals for Argentina in his career . In 1978 he was named South American Football Player of the Year ( `` El Mundo '' , Caracas , Venezuela ) . He was named by PelÃ as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004 . Kempes made his full time coaching debut in Albania . His brief spell with Lushnja was groundbreaking , as he became the first foreign coach who signed a foreign player for the first time in Albanian soccer history . His career in Albania came to a quick end in 1997 . The following year , he landed a job with Venezuelan side Mineros de Guayana . In 1999 , Kempes moved to Bolivia and managed The Strongest , before taking charge of Blooming in 2000 . Previously , he worked as assistant coach for Uruguayan manager HÃ ctor NÃ Ã ez in Valencia , and as a player-manager of Indonesian League champions Pelita Jaya .

Youthanasia is the sixth studio album by American heavy metal band Megadeth , released on November 1 , 1994 through Capitol Records . A remixed and remastered version , featuring several bonus tracks , was released in 2004 . It saw Megadeth continuing a trend toward slower , more melodic hard rock songs which began with their commercial breakthrough album , Countdown to Extinction . Lyrically , the album displays a variety of influences : mythology ( `` Elysian Fields '' and `` Blood of Heroes '' ) , rape and incest ( `` Family Tree '' ) , nuclear war ( `` Black Curtains '' ) , gambling ( `` Train of Consequences '' , which can also be seen on the video ) , and a hit about the last moments in life , '' Ã Tout le Monde '' . The title is a pun on euthanasia , implying that society is euthanizing its youth , which would be consistent with bandleader and principal songwriter Dave Mustaine 's views . The closing track , `` Victory '' , refers to many of the band 's previous songs throughout its lyrics . Megadeth 's previous album , Countdown to Extinction , was tremendously successful and the band was faced with the daunting task of making an album to follow it . It was a time of problems and conflicts for Megadeth , in that every two weeks or so according to Mustaine , there were `` outrageous emotional interventions '' in order to make the group a democracy . Many band meetings during this period concerned Mustaine 's creative control over a `` successful formula '' , so that the band could better exercise their creativity . Another problem was the indecision on where the recording would take place . Mustaine did not want to record in Los Angeles , so the band eventually decided to record in Phoenix in the home state of the majority of the band , Arizona . They began recording in Phase Four Studios ( the studio in which the 2004 remaster was remixed ) in March 1994 , but due to problems they left and decided to find another studio . There were no likely choices in Phoenix , so producer Max Norman suggested building a studio of their own . The construction process was recorded on Evolver - The Making of Youthanasia . As of 2010 , this is the only Megadeth album recorded in E-flat guitar tuning ( guitar strings tuned down half a step ) . All preceding and subsequent albums are in standard tuning , with the exceptions of a few songs on other albums .

Spyro : Enter the Dragonfly or Spyro 4 is the fourth game in the Spyro series . It is the first Spyro game for the sixth generation consoles , PlayStation 2 and GameCube , and the first console Spyro game not developed by Insomniac Games . It is also the first game not to be exclusively released on one console . Universal Interactive was going to port this game on the Xbox and PC shortly after the PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions , but both versions got ultimately canceled due to the negative reviews , according to IGN . The story begins shortly after Spyro : Year of the Dragon . The dragons are in celebration of a rite of passage for the young dragons and for the Grand Dragon Parade , with the arrival of new dragonfly guardians for the young dragons . However , during the party , a strangely alive Ripto ( the circumstances of his return are left unexplained ) teleports in via a portal along with Crush and Gulp ( their return is also glossed over ) and disrupts the celebration , intent on capturing the new dragonflies to weaken the young dragons . However , his spell misfires and the dragonflies become scattered throughout the Dragon Realm . So , Spyro is tasked with recovering the realm 's new crop of dragonflies . Spyro eventually completes his mission , and faces Ripto . Spyro wins the battle and Ripto runs for his life , swearing that he 'll be back ( even though he never appeared in the rest of the original series again , excluding the spin-off titles released after Spyro : Season of Ice . ) The game ends back at the party , with Spyro winking at the player . According to this , the game was originally going to be about Gnasty Gnorc coming back and teaming up with Ripto so that the two could get all of the dragonflies for themselves as well as contain around 120 dragonflies to collect , over 25 levels , a framerate of 60 frames per second and fast loading times . However , Universal Interactive Studios forced the developers to rush on developing the game in order to be available by Winter 2002 ( with this being the only title that both studios ever produced ) , and therefore it suffers from an inconsistent framerate , long loading times , graphical glitches , sound issues and lock-ups . Additionally , Gnasty does not appear anywhere in the game at all ( but is mentioned by Ripto in the intro ) , there are only nine levels for the player to explore ( all of which are in one hubworld ) and only 90 dragonflies for the player to collect . The game received very negative reviews amongst critics and fans alike due to glitches , long loading times , confusing level design , lacklustre gameplay , repetitive music , bad voice acting , sound issues , lock-ups at certain points , poorly-animated cutscenes , unresponsive controls , clichÃ character dialogue , lack of a storyline and inconsistent framerates . The Nintendo GameCube version was released a week after the Sony PlayStation 2 version . This version has greatly reduced loading times , no lock-ups and less jagged and more natural colored visuals . However , it was still criticized for having the same inconsistent framerate and occasional graphical glitches as the PlayStation 2 version . Despite the negative response , the game sold enough copies to receive Greatest Hits ( Platinum Edition in Europe ) status on the Sony PlayStation 2 and Player 's Choice status on the Nintendo GameCube .
`` The Telltale Head '' is the eighth episode of The Simpsons first season , and it originally aired February 25 , 1990 . It was written by Al Jean , Mike Reiss , Sam Simon , Matt Groening , and directed by Rich Moore . In the episode , Bart cuts the head off the statue of Jebediah Springfield in the center of town to impress Jimbo , Kearney and Dolph , three older kids he admires . The town 's residents , including the three boys , are horrified and Bart regrets his actions . After telling his family , Homer and Bart head to the center of town , where they are met by an angry mob . After Bart tells the mob he has made a mistake , the townspeople forgive Bart and he places the head back on the statue . The episode 's title is a reference to the short story `` The Tell-Tale Heart '' by Edgar Allan Poe . The episode begins in medias res - Homer and Bart are chased through the streets of Springfield by an angry mob while carrying the head of the statue of their town founder , Jebediah Springfield . Surrounded by the mob , Bart begins to relate the events of the previous day . Bart suffers through a boring morning at church and is forbidden to see the violent new Space Mutants movie . After church he runs into local troublemakers Jimbo , Dolph , and Kearney , and , wanting to seem cool , sneaks into the Space Mutants movie with them . After being thrown out of the movie , the troublemakers shoplift from the Kwik-E-Mart , throw rocks at the Jebediah Springfield statue , and watch clouds . Bart remarks that one cloud resembles Jebediah Springfield , but without a head . His new friends remark that they wish someone would cut off the statue 's head , saying it would be funny to see the town so upset . Bart is conflicted and asks Homer whether it 's okay to compromise your beliefs to be popular . Homer tells Bart that popularity is the most important thing in the world , as long as Bart is n't talking about killing someone . That night , Bart sneaks out of the house and saws off the statue 's head . The town is shaken by the crime . Even Jimbo , Dolph , and Kearney are upset , telling Bart that if they met the person responsible , they would attack them critically . Bart begins to feel guilty for what he has done , and his conscience manifests itself as the statue 's severed head , which begins speaking to him . Unable to go on , Bart confesses his crime to the family , explaining that he thought that being popular was the most important thing in the world . It was then Homer realized that he inspired Bart of his popularity advice that caused him to commit the crime . It was then Bart decided to return the head back where it belongs , and a guilty Homer follows along , feeling responsible for this . They are found by the angry mob , returning the story to the beginning . Bart tells the mob that his act has actually brought the town closer together , to which the mob agrees . The head is returned back to the statue and everyone forgives Bart . Homer and Bart leave , Homer reminding Bart that `` not all lynch mobs are this nice . '' The idea to have the episode in flashbacks was originally thought up in the color screening stage of production . This is the first episode directed by Rich Moore . This is the first time Jebediah Springfield is mentioned , as well as the first time the Simpsons go to church . The announcer of the football game Homer is listening to at church is based on Keith Jackson . Bart awakening and finding the head of Jebediah Springfield in bed next to him is a reference to the famous scene in The Godfather where Jack Woltz , a Jewish movie producer , finds the head of his prize racehorse next to him one morning . This is the first episode of the series in which Sideshow Bob , Reverend Timothy Lovejoy , Krusty the Clown , Jimbo Jones , Kearney Zzyzwicz , Dolphin `` Dolph '' Starbeam , Ms. Albright , and Apu Nahasapeemapetilon appear . Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , said they enjoyed : `` the Simpsons ( being ) grossly dysfunctional in church , Homer dispensing terrible advice , and a real moral dilemma for Bart . '' In a DVD review of the first season , David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 3\/5 and added that `` This is a strange episode , touching on many bizarre aspects of the show to come '' . Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said `` Good little moments abounded , and this was a generally solid episode . I liked the objects the boys saw in the clouds , and quite a few other funny bits appeared . â Telltaleâ wasnâ t a great episode , but it was generally entertaining and clever . ''

The Great Seal of the State of Alabama is the state seal of the U.S. state of Alabama . The first seal was designed in 1817 by William Wyatt Bibb , the governor of the Alabama Territory and the subsequent first governor of the state . When Alabama became a state in 1819 , the state legislature adopted the design as the official state seal . The seal prominently features a map showing one of the state 's most valuable resources -- its major rivers . The map was shown affixed to a living tree , with no motto . The design was replaced with a new seal on December 29 , 1868 . The law describes the design thus : The seal is in the form of a circle , and two and a quarter inches in diameter ; near the edge is the word ` ALABAMA ' and opposite , at the same distance from the edge , are the words ` GREAT SEAL . ' In the center of the seal an eagle is represented with raised wings alighting upon the national shield , with three arrows in his left talon . The eagle holds in his beak a streamer , on which immediately over the wings are the words ` HERE WE REST . ' The crest-word , which give name to the State , signifies `` The land of rest . '' In 1939 , at the request of Governor Frank M. Dixon , the original concept of a map design was returned to use . The new seal was adopted during a special session called by the Governor . The design was described as follows : The seal shall be circular , and the diameter thereof two and a quarter inches ; near the edge of the circle shall be the word `` Alabama , '' and opposite this word , at the same distance from the edge , shall be the words , `` Great Seal . '' In the center of the seal there shall be a representation of a map of the state with its principal rivers . The seal shall be called the `` Great Seal of the State of Alabama . '' The seal shall be kept and used as required by the Constitution and laws . The use of stars in the border , the specific design of the letterforms and the map image , the labeling of adjacent states and the Gulf of Mexico , and the application of colors to the seal are not described in the law .
British Rail 18100 was a prototype main line gas turbine-electric locomotive built for British Railways in 1951 by Metropolitan-Vickers , Manchester . It had , however , been ordered by the Great Western Railway in the 1940s , but construction was delayed due to World War II . It spent its working life on the Western Region of British Railways , operating express passenger services from London Paddington station . It was of Co-Co wheel arrangement and its gas turbine was rated at 3000 h. It had a maximum speed of 90 m and weighed 129.5 tons . It was painted in BR black livery , with a silver stripe around the middle of the body and silver numbers . The gas turbine was of a type which would now be called a Turboshaft engine but it differed from modern turboshaft engines in having only one turbine to drive both the compressor and the output shaft . It was based on aircraft practice and had six horizontal combustion chambers ( spaced radially around the turbine shaft ) and no heat exchanger . The emphasis was on power , rather than economy , and the fuel consumption was high . It was designed to use aviation kerosene and was much more expensive to run than No. 18000 , which used heavy fuel oil . The turbine drove , through reduction gearing : Each main generator powered two traction motors . Unlike No. 18000 , there was no auxiliary diesel engine and the turbine was started by battery power , using the main generators as starter motors . The following table gives a comparison between 18000 and 18100 . There are some anomalies and these are described in the notes . In early 1958 it was withdrawn from operation and was stored at Swindon Works for a short period before it was returned to Metropolitan Vickers for conversion as a prototype 25 kV AC electric locomotive . As an electric locomotive , it was numbered E1000 ( E2001 from 1959 ) and was given the TOPS classification of class 80 .

The term template , when used in the context of word processing software , refers to a sample `` fill-in-the-blank '' document that can be completed either by hand or through an automated iterative process , such as with a software assistant . Once the template is completed , the user can edit , save and manage the result as an ordinary word processing document . Word processing templates enable the ability to bypass the initial setup and configuration time necessary to create standardized documents such as a resume . They also enable the automatic configuration of the user interface of the word processing software , with features such as autocompletion , toolbars , thesaurus , and spelling options . Word processing templates are ordinarily included as a regular feature of most word processing software . In addition , users of such software often have the option to create and save their own templates , or to acquire them from the original vendor of the software , or from third parties . Word processing templates have the standard `` fill-in-the-blank '' features similar to other kinds of templates in computer software , and they also have features that specifically leverage the functionality of the word processor user interface . Additionally , there may exist support for other native features unique to the word processing application . Word processing document creation may ordinarily ( although not necessarily ) begin with selecting a template with a menu command such as : ( and select the template you wish to use ) , from which point the user is given the option of selecting a pre-existing template . Similar commands are provided for creating and editing templates . Template files may restrict users from saving changes with the original file name , such as with the case of Microsoft Office ( . dot ) filename extensions . In those cases , the users are prompted to save the file with a new name as if it were a new file . 3 . WordDraw.com - Free Newsletter Templates 4 . biztree.com - Document Templates
B minor or B-flat minor is a minor scale based on B-flat , consisting of the pitches ( ( Bâ ( musical note ) B ) ) , C , ( ( Dâ ( musical note ) D ) ) , ( ( Eâ ( musical note ) E ) ) , F , ( ( Gâ ( musical note ) G ) ) , and ( ( Aâ ( musical note ) A ) ) . Its key signature has five flats . The harmonic minor scale would use an ( ( A ( musical note ) A ) ) instead of A. Its relative major is D-flat major , and its parallel major is B-flat major . Its enharmonic equivalent is A-sharp minor . B-flat minor is traditionally a ` dark ' key . '' Some important oboe solos in this key in the orchestral literature include the second movement of Tchaikovsky 's Symphony No. 4 , which depicts `` the feeling that you get when you are all alone '' , in Tchaikovsky 's words . Tchaikovsky 's Piano Concerto No. 1 is also in B-flat minor . The old valveless horn was barely capable of playing in B-flat minor ; the only example found in 18th century music is a modulation that occurs in the first minuet of Franz Krommer 's Concertino in D major , Opus 80 . All eight songs on The Raveonettes ' Whip It On album are in the key of B-flat minor . Sune Rose Wagner said it was `` Because Shostakovich 's symphony no. 13 was in B flat minor . ''
Californosaurus perrini ( ` Perrin 's California lizard ' ) was an ichthyosaur , an extinct reptile , from the Lower Hosselkus Limestone ( Carnian , Late Triassic ) of California . It has also been known as Shastasaurus perrini and Delphinosaurus ( ` dolphin lizard ' ) perrini . It is the basal-most known true ichthyosaur ( Euichthyosauria ) . The long-snouted head is small in comparison with the rest of the body , as in basal ichthyosaurs such as Mixosaurus and Cymbospondylus . The tail is sharply turned downwards , in common with more advanced ichthyosaurs , with a small vertical fluke . It may have had a small dorsal fin . There is a small number of pre-sacral vertebrae ( 45 or 50 ) . The phalanges ( digit bones ) are circular and widely spaced , giving the flipper a round appearance . It was three metres long . It fed on fish and other small marine creatures . Like other ichthyosaurs it probably never ventured onto dry land , and gave birth in the water .
West Macedonia is one of the thirteen peripheries of Greece , consisting of the western part of the region of Macedonia . It is divided into the peripheral units of Florina , Grevena , Kastoria , and Kozani . The periphery of West Macedonia is situated in north-western Greece , bordering with the peripheries of Central Macedonia ( east ) , Thessaly ( south ) , Epirus ( west ) , and bounded to the north at the international borders of Greece with the Republic of Macedonia ( Bitola region ) and Albania ( KorÃ Ã `` region ) . Although it covers a total surface of 9451 k ( 7,2 % of countryâ s total ) , it has a total population of 302,892 inhabitants ( 2.9 % of the countryâ s total ) , thus it is a low-density populated Region ( 32 per kmÂ , as compared to the countryâ s 79.7 relevant figure ) . This is mainly due to the mountainous nature of the Region , as 82 % of the total surface are mountainous and semi-mountainous areas . This is also reflected in the population distribution , as the major part of the population ( 56 % ) lives in rural areas . Capital of the periphery is Kozani with 47,451 inhabitants . Other main towns are Ptolemaida ( 32,775 ) , Grevena ( 16,704 ) , Florina ( 14,318 ) and Kastoria ( 13,959 ) . The Region has one operational Industrial Area in Florina and another one under construction in Kozani . The secondary sector is very important for the Regional economy , mainly due to the mining activities , the production of electric power ( 70 % of countryâ s total power is produced in the Region ) and the fur-leather sector . However , â softâ structures have not followed the general improvement of heavy infrastructures , a situation that has to be remedied , in order to achieve an overall higher economic development of the Region . The R&D services are at a rather low level : only 3,5 % of the countryâ s total research foundations are situated in the Region . Among them , the Technological Educational Institute plays an important role in supporting the regional research and educational efforts . However , an enhanced interaction with SMEâ s will be a crucial factor , in order to improve the productivity and the added value of products and services generated in the Region of Western Macedonia . Some of its more famous products are marbles , Saffron ( krokos Kozanis ) , fruits , local wines ( Kozani , Amyntaio ) , furs ( Kastoria , Siatista ) and specialized arts and crafts industry . The Egnatia motorway via Egnatia ( Trans â `` European Network ) that crosses the Region , along with its two vertical National Roads , form a network that dramatically improves the transport conditions in the Region and alter its traditional â isolationâ image , mainly due to its mountainous landscape . On the other hand , the railroad network is insufficient and the two airports ( Kozani and Kastoria ) can only serve small passenger planes . The telecommunication network has drastically improved over the last decade , providing the regional population with adequate services and modern facilities . The last years the region is being developed in tourism mainly on winter . It is the only Greek periphery without sea coast , but on the other side there are a lot of lakes , mountains , graphic villages and two big ski centers in Florina ( Vigla ) and Grevena ( Vasilitsa ) and one other under construction in Kozani ( Velvendos ) . The building of West Macedonia Periphery is located in Zone of Alternate Urban Planning ( ZEP ) in the city of Kozani . The West Macedonia Periphery was established in the 1987 administrative reform , comprising the prefectures of Kastoria , Grevena , Kozani and Florina . With the 2010 Kallikratis Programme ( Act 3852\/2010 ) , its powers and authority were redefined and extended . The periphery is based at Kozani and is divided into four peripheral units ( the pre-Kallikratis prefectures ) , which are further subdivided into 12 municipalities ( down from 61 pre-Kalikratis local administrative units ) . Along with the Epirus Periphery it is supervised by the Decentralized Administration of Epirus and West Macedonia based at Ioannina . The periphery 's governor is , since 1 January 2011 , Konstantinos Dakis , who was elected in the November 2010 local administration elections for the New Democracy party . According to the 2001 census , the population of West Macedonia was 303,857 people . Today , the periphery has a mixed population of Greeks and Slavophone Greeks ( 12 % of the population ) . The former are mainly concentrated in Florina , Kastoria and Ptolemaida . Other smaller communities include Aromanians and Arvanites . The University of Western Macedonia and the technological faculties help in the intellectual growth of region . There is a big number of students who 's studying main in the Pedagogic Department and in Department of Balkan study of the University in Florina and in the Department of Energy Management of the University and in Technological Educational Institute of Western Macedonia in Kozani .
The Purus is a tributary of the Amazon River in South America . Its drainage basin is 63166 k , and the mean discharge is 8,400 mÂ \/ s. It enters the Amazon River west of the Madeira River , which it parallels as far south as the falls of the latter stream . It runs through a continuous forest at the bottom of the great depression lying between the Madeira River , which skirts the edge of the Brazilian sandstone plateau , and the Ucayali which hugs the base of the Andes . The river forms a small part of the international boundary between Brazil and Peru . One of its marked features is the five parallel furos which from the north-west at almost regular intervals the Amazon sends to the Purus ; the most south-westerly one being about 150 miles ( 240 km ) above the mouth of the latter river . They cut a great area of very low-lying country into five islands . Farther down the Purus to the right three smaller furos also connect it with the Amazon . William Chandless found its elevation above sea-level to be only 107 feet ( 33 m ) 590 miles ( 950 km ) from its mouth . It is one of the most crooked streams in the world , and its length in a straight line is less than half that by its curves . It is practically only a drainage ditch for the half-submerged , lake-flooded district it traverses . Its width is very uniform for 1000 miles ( 1600 km ) up , and for 800 miles ( 1300 km ) its depth is never less than 45 feet ( 15 m ) . It is navigable by steamers for 1648 miles ( 2650 km ) as far as the little stream , the Curumaha , but only by light-draft craft . Chandless ascended it 1866 miles ( 3,000 km ) . At 1792 miles ( 2,880 km ) it forks into two small streams . Occasionally a cliff touches the river , but in general the lands are subject to yearly inundations throughout its course , the river rising at times above 50 feet ( 15 m ) , the numerous lakes to the right and left serving as reservoirs . Its main tributary , the Aquiry or Acre River , enters from the right about 1104 miles ( 1777 km ) from the Amazon . Its sources are near those of the Mayutata . It is navigable for a period of about five months of the year , when the Purus valley is inundated ; and , for the remaining seven months , only canoes can ascend it sufficiently high to communicate overland with the settlements in the great India-rubber districts of the Mayutata and lower Beni ; thus these regions are forced to seek a canoe outlet for their rich products by the very dangerous , costly and laborious route of the falls of the Madeira River . In 2008 a previously unknown precolumbian civilization was discovered in the upper region of the river close to the Bolivian border . After much of the forest in the region was cleared for agricultural use , satellite pictures revealed the remains of large geometric earthworks .

Conceived by Oliver Bulleid for the Southern Railway 's Dartford commuter route , the two 4DD electric multiple units were the only double-deck trains to run on the main line railway network in Britain . Whilst common in Europe and North America the restrictive railway loading gauge in the United Kingdom prohibits normal double-deck cars with two fully separated decks . On the 4DD carriages the upper-level seats were squeezed in between the lower-level seats to ensure that the overall height of the unit was within the clearances necessary to pass through tunnels and under bridges . The 4DD was somewhat unsuccessful because the upper level compartments were cramped and poorly ventilated ( the upper level windows could not be opened due to tight clearance ) . The compartments were pressure-ventilated but the equipment proved to be troublesome . Dwell times at stations were lengthened because of the increase in the number of passengers per door . To obtain the extra seating capacity that was being sought , it was instead decided to lengthen trains from eight cars to ten . Unusually for an `` experiment '' they lasted in traffic from 1949 to 1971 , undergoing routine maintenance and repaints with no hiccups in their life . Driving motor cars 13003 and 13004 survive , the former at Kent Locomotives Ltd - Sellinge , Kent , and the latter at the Northamptonshire Ironstone Railway Trust . One trailer was also saved , but has since been scrapped .
Ricardo Gallego Redondo ( born 8 February 1959 in Madrid ) is a retired Spanish footballer , in the defensive midfielder position . Most of his professional career was associated to Real Madrid , for which he appeared in more than 300 official games in nearly 10 years , winning a total of ten major titles . He gained nearly 50 caps for Spain , representing the nation in two FIFA World Cups and as many UEFA European Football Championships . A product of La Liga powerhouse Real Madrid 's youth system , Gallego made a quick impression with the first team , appearing in 26 matches in his debut year , and being a midfield mainstay during the subsequent seasons as he totalled 250 first division matches , with the conquest of , among others , four leagues , two Spanish cups and back-to-back UEFA Cups ( 1985 â `` 86 ) ; blessed with physical and technical ability alike , he could operate with equal efficiency as sweeper . In the 1986 â `` 87 season , Gallego contributed with 37 matches and two goals ( more than 3,000 minutes of play ) as Real Madrid won the national championship , also reaching the semifinals of the domestic cup . On 15 March 1987 , however , he unluckily landed on Miguel de AndrÃ s ' knee , and the Athletic Bilbao player ended his career after that game , a 2 â `` 1 win at the San MamÃ s Stadium . After a brief spell with Italy 's Udinese Calcio , Gallego returned to Spain and Madrid , playing two seasons with Rayo Vallecano in the second division , and contributing with 31 games in his second and last , for an eventual promotion . Retiring at 33 , he then worked with his last club in directorial capacities . Gallego earned 42 caps for Spain , his debut coming in a preparation match for the impending FIFA World Cup on home soil , a 24 February 1982 win with Scotland : after replacing FC Barcelona 's VÃ ctor MuÃ oz in the second half , he closed the score at 3 â `` 0 . After being used only once during that World Cup , Gallego turned into an essential defensive element in the following two competitions : UEFA Euro 1984 ( where Spain finished runners-up ) and the 1986 FIFA World Cup , retiring from international play after Euro 88 .
The Seva Foundation is an international health organization founded by Ram Dass in 1978 along with public health leader Larry Brilliant and humanitarian activist Wavy Gravy . The term psychedelic is derived from the Greek words Ï Ï Ï Î ( psyche , `` soul '' ) and Î Î Î '' Î á Î 1\/2 ( deloun , `` to manifest '' ) , translating to `` soul-manifesting '' . A psychedelic experience is characterized by the perception of aspects of one 's mind previously unknown , or by the creative exuberance of the mind liberated from its ostensibly ordinary fetters . Psychedelic states are an array of experiences elicited by various techniques , including sensory stimulation , sensory deprivation as well as by psychedelic substances . Such experiences include hallucinations , changes of perception , synesthesia , altered states of awareness , mystical states , and occasionally states resembling psychosis . The term was first coined as a noun in 1957 by psychiatrist Humphry Osmond as an alternative descriptor for hallucinogenic drugs in the context of psychedelic psychotherapy . Seeking a name for the experience induced by LSD , Osmond contacted Aldous Huxley , a personal acquaintance and advocate for the therapeutic use of the substance . Huxley coined the term `` phanerothyme , '' from the Greek terms for `` manifest '' ( Ï Î Î 1\/2 Î Ï Ï Ï ) and `` spirit '' ( Î Ï Î 1\/4 Ï Ï ) . In a letter to Osmond , he wrote : It was on this term that Osmond eventually settled , because it was `` clear , euphonious and uncontaminated by other associations . '' Timothy Leary was a well-known proponent of the use of psychedelics , as was Aldous Huxley . However , both advanced widely different opinions on the broad use of psychedelics by state and civil society . Leary promulgated the idea of such substances as a panacea , while Huxley suggested that only the cultural and intellectual elite should partake of entheogens systematically . The use of psychedelic drugs became widespread in the modern West in the mid-1960s . The impact of psychedelic drugs on western culture in the 1960s led to semantic drift in the use of the word `` psychedelic '' , and it is now frequently used to describe anything with abstract decoration of multiple bright colors , similar to those seen in drug-induced hallucinations . In objection to this new meaning , and to what some consider pejorative meanings of other synonyms such as `` hallucinogen '' and `` psychotomimetic '' , the term `` entheogen '' was proposed and is seeing increasing use . However , many consider the term `` entheogen '' best reserved for religious and spiritual usage , such as certain Native American churches do with the peyote sacrament , and `` psychedelic '' left to describe those who are using these drugs for recreation , psychotherapy , physical healing , or creative problem solving . In science , hallucinogen remains the standard term . Many artists in the late 1960s and early 1970s attempted to illustrate the psychedelic experience . One example of this experimentation is seen in Mati Klarwein 's painting Annunciation , which was used as the cover art for Santana 's Abraxas . The cover of Pink Floyd 's 1968 album A Saucerful of Secrets is also of this type . The cover of Oasis ' 2008 album , Dig Out Your Soul , also has a psychedelic album cover , with a slightly muted color scheme . `` Body Count '' - Part 2 of The Short-Timers , the semi-autobiographical novel by American former Marine and Vietnam War veteran Gustav Hasford that inspired the film Full Metal Jacket , includes a psychedelic dream sequence denoting the perspective of the wounded war journalist named Joker . The fashion for psychedelic drugs gave its name to the style of psychedelia , a term describing a category of rock music known as psychedelic rock , as well as visual art , fashion , and culture that is associated originally with the high 1960s , hippies , and the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco , California . One of the first uses of the word in the music scene of this time was in the 1964 recording of `` Hesitation Blues '' by folk group the Holy Modal Rounders . The term was introduced to rock music and popularized by the 13th Floor Elevators 1966 album The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators . Psychedelia truly took off in 1967 with the Summer of Love and , although associated with San Francisco , the style soon spread across the US , and worldwide . The counterculture of the 1960s had a strong influence on the popular culture of the early 1970s .
Miguel MuÃ oz MozÃ n ( born 19 January 1922 â `` died 16 July 1990 in Madrid ) was a Spanish football player and manager . A midfielder , he spent the majority of his career at Real Madrid , where he also coached with great success , then went on to have a six-year coaching spell with the Spanish national team . MuÃ oz played for various junior teams in the Madrid area , but initially failed to attract the attention of Real . He subsequently played for CD LogroÃ Ã s , Racing de Santander and Celta de Vigo . In 1948 MuÃ oz , together with teammate PahiÃ o , helped Celta finish fourth in the first division and reach the Copa del GeneralÃ simo final , where he scored in the 1 â `` 4 defeat to Sevilla CF . The following season , both players signed for Real Madrid , and MuÃ oz went on to appear in 347 official matches with the club from the capital . Additionally , he gained seven caps for Spain , but never appeared in any major tournament . MuÃ oz scored the club 's first ever goal in the European Cup against Servette FC ; subsequently , he captained Real in two consecutive competition wins , in 1956 â `` 57 , and retired from football the following year , at nearly 36 . MuÃ oz served a brief apprenticeship as coach of Real 's reserve team , then named Plus Ultra CF , before been appointed coach of the senior team in 1959 . His time in charge was one of the clubs most successful eras as , under his guidance , the club won the league nine times . This included a five in a row sequence ( 1961 â `` 1965 ) and another three consecutive . On the European front , MuÃ oz led Real Madrid to two more wins in the European Cup , in 1960 and 1966 . As a result , he became the first person to win the competition both as a player and a coach , which was later matched by Giovanni Trapattoni , Johan Cruyff , Carlo Ancelotti , Frank Rijkaard and Josep Guardiola . He left in 1974 after 16 seasons , as the side 's longest-serving and most successful coach . After seven more club seasons ( Granada CF , HÃ rcules CF , UD Las Palmas and Sevilla ) , MuÃ oz took the reins of the national side , after its group stage exit in the 1982 FIFA World Cup , on home soil . Previously , he had had a four-game interim spell in the late 60 's , and eventually led Spain to the UEFA Euro 1984 runner-up place , as well as the quarterfinals of the 1986 World Cup . MuÃ oz died in Madrid aged 68 , from bleeding due to esophageal varices .

Hydrogen fluoride is a chemical compound with the formula HF . It is the principal industrial source of fluorine , often in the aqueous form as hydrofluoric acid , and thus is the precursor to many important compounds including pharmaceuticals and polymers ( e.g. Teflon ) . HF is widely used in the petrochemical industry and a component of many superacids . HF boils just below room temperature whereas the other hydrogen halides condense at much lower temperatures . Unlike the other hydrogen halides , HF is lighter than air and it is particularly penetrating , which can damage the lungs . Aqueous solutions of HF , called hydrofluoric acid , are strongly corrosive . HF forms orthorhombic crystals , consisting of zig-zag chains of HF molecules . The HF molecules , with a short H -- F bond of 0.95 Ã , are linked to neighboring molecules by intermolecular H -- F distances of 1.55 Ã Liquid HF also consists of chains of HF molecules , but the chains are shorter , consisting on average of only five or six molecules . The higher boiling point of HF relative to analogous species , such as HCl , is attributed to hydrogen bonding between HF molecules , as indicated by the existence of chains even in the liquid state . The acidity of hydrofluoric acid solutions vary with concentration owing to hydrogen-bond interactions of the fluoride ion . Dilute solutions are weakly acidic with an acid ionization constant Ka = 6.6 10 4 ( or pKa = 3.18 ) , in contrast to corresponding solutions of the other hydrogen halides which are strong acids . Concentrated solutions of hydrogen fluoride are much more strongly acid than implied by this value , as shown by measurements of the Hammett acidity function H0 ( or â effective pHâ ) . For 100 % , HF has an H0 , estimated to be between 10.2 and 11 , which is comparable to the value 12 for sulfuric acid . In thermodynamic terms , HF solutions are highly non-ideal , with the activity of HF increasing much more rapidly than its concentration . The first equilibrium to the right and the second to the left , meaning that HF is extensively dissociated , but that the tight ion pairs reduce the thermodynamic activity coefficient of H3O + , so that the solution is effectively less acidic . In concentrated solution , the additional HF causes the ion pair to dissociate with formation of the hydrogen-bonded hydrogen difluoride ion . The increase in free H3O + due to this reaction accounts for the rapid increase in acidity , while fluoride ions are stabilized ( and become less basic ) by strong hydrogen bonding to HF to form HF2 . This interaction between the acid and its own conjugate base is an example of homoconjugation . At the limit of 100 % liquid HF , there is autoionization that forms an extremely acidic solution ( H0 = 11 ) . The acidity of anhydrous HF can be increased even further by the addition of Lewis acids such as SbF5 , which can reduce H0 to 21 . Hydrogen fluoride is produced as by the action of sulfuric acid on pure grades of the mineral fluorite and also as a side-product of the extraction of the fertilizer precursor phosphoric acid from various minerals . See also hydrofluoric acid . The anhydrous compound hydrogen fluoride is more commonly used than its aqueous solution , hydrofluoric acid . HF serves as a catalyst in alkylation processes in oil refineries . A component of high-octane gasoline called `` alkylate '' is generated in Alkylation units that combine C3 and C4 olefins and isobutane to generate gasoline . HF is a reactive solvent in the electrochemical fluorination of organic compounds . In this approach , HF is oxidized in the presence of a hydrocarbon and the fluorine replaces C -- H bonds with C -- F bonds . Perfluorinated carboxylic acids and sulfonic acids are produced in this way . Hydrogen fluoride is an important catalyst used in the majority of the installed linear alkyl benzene production in the world . The process involves dehydrogenation of n-paraffins to olefins , and subsequent reaction with benzene using HF as catalyst . Elemental fluorine , F2 , is prepared by electrolysis of a solution of HF and potassium bifluoride . The potassium bifluoride is needed because anhydrous hydrogen fluoride does not conduct electricity . Several million kilograms of F2 are produced annually . Upon contact with moisture , including tissue , hydrogen fluoride immediately converts to hydrofluoric acid , which is highly corrosive and toxic , and requires immediate medical attention upon exposure .

Louisa is a city in Lawrence County , Kentucky , United States . The population was 2,018 at the 2000 census . It is the county seat of Lawrence County . The Levisa Fork River and Tug Fork River join at Louisa to form the Big Sandy River . Just north of this merger is the location of the first needle dam in the United States which was completed in 1896 . The origin on of the city 's name is unclear . Theories include that it was named for Louisa County , Virginia , or a corruption of the name of the river ( `` Levisa '' ) or that it was named after Louisa Swetnam , one of the first children born in the area to Europeans . Settlement attempts began as early as 1790 , but did not take hold until 1818 . Louisa became the county seat in 1822 and a city in 1823 . During the American Civil War , Union troops under future president James A. Garfield occupied the town from December 1861 until the end of the war , despite several Confederate takeover attempts . The city was home to Fred M. Vinson , 13th Chief Justice of the United States . The Chattaroi Railroad ( now a part of CSX ) connected to Louisa in 1881 . The city is also served by US 23 . Louisa is located at ( 38.112054 , -82.605796 ) . According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 1.4 square miles ( 3.6 kmÂ ) , of which , 1.4 square miles ( 3.5 kmÂ ) of it is land and 0.04 square miles ( 0.1 kmÂ ) of it ( 2.17 % ) is water . The bridge from Louisa , in eastern Lawrence County , to Fort Gay , West Virginia is something of a geographic and architectural oddity . The quarter-mile concrete span spans two forks of the Big Sandy River , connects two states and has a right turn at its halfway point , which connects traffic to the Point Section neighborhood of Louisa . Every second weekend in September , Louisa hosts the regional Septemberfest that features several local and national acts performing for three days , as well as the huge arts and crafts section on the northwestern side of town and the many food vendors featuring Southeastern cuisine . As of the census of 2000 , there were 2,018 people , 927 households , and 548 families residing in the city . The population density was 1,496.2 people per square mile ( 577.2 \/ kmÂ ) .

Standard of living is generally measured by standards such as real ( i.e. inflation adjusted ) income per person and poverty rate . Other measures such as access and quality of health care , income growth inequality and educational standards are also used . Examples are access to certain goods ( such as number of refrigerators per 1000 people ) , or measures of health such as life expectancy . It is the ease by which people living in a time or place are able to satisfy their needs and\/or wants . The idea of a ` standard ' may be contrasted with the quality of life , which takes into account not only the material standard of living , but also other more intangible aspects that make up human life , such as leisure , safety , cultural resources , social life , physical health , environmental quality issues etc. . More complex means of measuring well-being must be employed to make such judgements , and these are very often political , thus controversial . Even between two nations or societies that have similar material standards of living , quality of life factors may in fact make one of these places more attractive to a given individual or group . However , there can be problems even with just using numerical averages to compare material standards of living , as opposed to , for instance , a Pareto index ( a measure of the breadth of income or wealth distribution ) . Standards of living are perhaps inherently subjective . As an example , countries with a very small , very rich upper class and a very large , very poor lower class may have a high mean level of income , even though the majority of people have a low `` standard of living '' . This mirrors the problem of poverty measurement , which also tends towards the relative . This illustrates how distribution of income can disguise the actual standard of living . Likewise Country A , a perfectly socialist country with a planned economy with very low average per capita income would receive a higher score for having lower income inequality than Country B with a higher income inequality , even if the bottom of Country B 's population distribution had a higher per capita income than Country A. Real examples of this include former East Germany compared to former West Germany or North Korea compared to South Korea . In each case , the socialist country has a low income discrepancy ( and therefore would score high in that regard ) , but lower per capita incomes than a large majority of their neighboring counterpart . This can be avoided by using the measure of income at various percentiles of the population rather than a highly relative and controversial overall income inequality measure .
Pedaliaceae ( pedalium family or sesame family ) is a flowering plant family classified in the order Scrophulariales in the Cronquist system and Lamiales in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system . Cronquist included the family Martyniaceae in Pedaliaceae , but phylogenetic studies have shown that the two families are not closely related and they are maintained as separate by the APG . Both families are characterized by having mucilaginous hairs , which often give the stems and leaves a slimy or clammy feel , and often have fruits with hooks or horns . Sesame ( Sesamum indicum ) is the source of sesame seeds .
Vaccinium arboreum ( Sparkleberry or Farkleberry ) is a species of Vaccinium native to the southeastern United States , from southern Virginia west to southeastern Nebraska , south to Florida and eastern Texas , and north to Illinois . Vaccinium arboreum is a shrub ( rarely a small tree ) growing to 3-5 m ( rarely 9 m ) tall . The leaves are evergreen in the south of the range , but deciduous further north where winters are colder ; they are oval-elliptic with an acute apex , 3-7 cm long and 2-4 cm broad , with a smooth or very finely toothed margin . The flowers are white , bell-shaped , 3-4 mm diameter , with a five-lobed corolla , produced in racemes up to 5 cm long . The fruit is a round dry berry about 6 mm diameter , green at first , black when ripe , edible but bitter and tough .
Koyukuk is a city in Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area , Alaska , United States At the 2000 census the population was 101 . As of 2009 , Koyukuk is one of a number of Alaskan communities threated by erosion . The Koyukon Athabascans had seasonal camps and moved when the wild game migrated . There were 12 summer fish camps located on the Yukon River between the Koyukuk River and the Nowitna River . Trading between the Koyukon and Inupiat of the Kobuk River area has occurred before the arrival of Europeans . After the Alaska Purchase , a United States military telegraph line was constructed along the north side of the Yukon River and Koyukuk became the site of a telegraph station . A trading post opened around 1880 , just before the gold rush of 1884-85 . Steamboats on the Yukon , which supplied gold prospectors ran before and after 1900 with 46 boats in operation on the river in the peak year of 1900 . A measles epidemic and food shortages during 1900 reduced the population of the area by one-third . The first school in Koyukuk was constructed in 1939 . After the school was built , families began to live at Koyukuk year-round . Koyukuk is located at . Koyukuk is located on the Yukon River near the mouth of the Koyukuk River . It is 50 km ( 30 miles ) west of Galena . It is adjacent to the Koyukuk National Wildlife Refuge and the Innoko National Wildlife Refuge . According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 6.3 square miles ( 16.3 kmÂ ) , of which , 6.2 square miles ( 16.2 kmÂ ) of it is land and 0.04 square miles ( 0.1 kmÂ ) of it ( 0.64 % ) is water . As of the census of 2000 , there were 101 people , 39 households , and 24 families residing in the city . The population density was 16.2 people per square mile ( 6.2 \/ kmÂ ) . There were 55 housing units at an average density of 8.8 per square mile ( 3.4 \/ kmÂ ) . The racial makeup of the city was 8.91 % White and 91.09 % Native American . There were 39 households out of which 41.0 % had children under the age of 18 living with them , 30.8 % were married couples living together , 20.5 % had a female householder with no husband present , and 35.9 % were non-families . 35.9 % of all households were made up of individuals and 5.1 % had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older . The average household size was 2.59 and the average family size was 3.32 . In the city the age distribution of the population shows 34.7 % under the age of 18 , 8.9 % from 18 to 24 , 36.6 % from 25 to 44 , 12.9 % from 45 to 64 , and 6.9 % who were 65 years of age or older . The median age was 30 years . For every 100 females there were 98.0 males . For every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 144.4 males . The median income for a household in the city was $ 19,375 , and the median income for a family was $ 31,250 . Males had a median income of $ 30,000 versus $ 0 for females . The per capita income for the city was $ 11,341 . There were 20.8 % of families and 35.1 % of the population living below the poverty line , including 53.8 % of under eighteens and 33.3 % of those over 64 .
LicheÅ Stary is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Å lesin , within Konin County , Greater Poland Voivodeship , in west-central Poland . It lies approximately 7 k south-east of Å lesin , 14 k north-east of Konin , and 99 k east of the regional capital PoznaÅ . The village has a population of 1,100 . The village 's name means `` old LicheÅ '' ; it is often referred to as simply LicheÅ . Legends trace the name to the ancient Slavic pagan deity Licho , whose sanctuary was allegedly located nearby . LicheÅ Stary is the site of Poland 's largest church , Sanctuary of Our Lady of LicheÅ , completed in 2004 , which houses icon of the Virgin Mary called Our Lady of Sorrows , Queen of Poland . The sanctuary was constructed to accommodate the large number of pilgrims who come to venerate the image of the Virgin Mary , which according to tradition has been miraculous .
In 1999 , `` A Soundtrack for The Wheel of Time '' was released ; featuring music by Robert Berry , inspired by the books . Robert Jordan was the pen name of James Oliver Rigney , Jr. ( October 17 , 1948 -- September 16 , 2007 ) , under which he was best known as the author of the bestselling The Wheel of Time fantasy series . He also wrote under the pseudonyms Reagan O'Neal and Jackson O'Reilly . Jordan was born in Charleston , South Carolina . He served two tours in Vietnam ( from 1968 to 1970 ) with the United States Army as a helicopter gunner . He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster , the Bronze Star with `` V '' and oak leaf cluster , and two Vietnamese Gallantry Crosses with palm . After returning from Vietnam he attended The Citadel where he received an undergraduate degree in physics . After graduating he was employed by the United States Navy as a nuclear engineer . He began writing in 1977 . He was a history buff and enjoyed hunting , fishing , sailing , poker , chess , pool , and pipe collecting . He described himself as a `` High Church '' Episcopalian and received communion more than once a week . He lived with his wife Harriet McDougal , who works as a book editor ( currently with Tor Books ; she was also Jordan 's editor ) in a house built in 1797 . Responding to queries on the similarity of some of the concepts in his Wheel of Time books with Freemasonry concepts , Jordan admitted that he was a Freemason . However , `` like his father and grandfather , '' he did not prefer to advertise , possibly because of the negative propaganda against Freemasonry . In his own words , `` no man in this country should feel in danger because of his beliefs . '' On March 23 , 2006 , Jordan disclosed in a statement that he had been diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis , and that with treatment , his median life expectancy was four years , though he said he intended to beat the statistics . He later posted on his Dragonmount blog to encourage his fans not to worry about him and that he intended to have a long and fully creative life . He began chemotherapy treatment at Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minnesota in early April 2006 . Jordan was enrolled in a study using the drug Revlimid just approved for multiple myeloma but not yet tested on primary amyloidosis . Jordan died at approximately 2:45 p.m. EDT on September 16 , 2007 , and a funeral service was held for him on Wednesday , September 19 , 2007 . Jordan was cremated and his ashes buried at an Episcopal church plot outside Charleston . His life was the subject of the feature length documentary The Wit of the Staircase : The Life and Works of Robert Jordan , scheduled for release in late 2011 . Jordan published eleven books of a projected twelve total in the main sequence of the Wheel of Time series . Reviewers and fans of the earlier books noted a slowing of the pace of events in the last few installments owing to the expansion of scale of the series as a whole . Because of his health problems , Jordan did not work at full force on the final installment A Memory of Light ( later split into three volumes beginning with The Gathering Storm ) , but blog entries confirmed that he continued work on it until his death , and he shared all of the significant plot details with his family not long before he died . He maintained that in doing so the book will get published even if `` the worst actually happens . '' On December 7 , 2007 , Tor Books announced that Brandon Sanderson had been chosen to finish the Wheel of Time series . Jordan 's widow chose him after reading Mistborn : The Final Empire . Jordan was one of several writers who have written new Conan the Barbarian stories . Some bibliographies also include Conan : King of Thieves ; this however , was actually the working title of the second Conan movie , Conan the Destroyer , and hence Jordan 's novelization . Jordan had already been hired to do the novelization and Tor had already applied for an ISBN when the title was changed to Conan the Destroyer . Jordan also compiled a well-known Conan Chronology . Jordan mentioned several times that he planned another fantasy series set in a different kind of world . He said that it would be a ShÅ gun-esque series about a man in his 30s who is shipwrecked in an unknown culture which would be similar to Seanchan culture in his Wheel of Time series and world . The books would detail his adventures there , and would have been titled Infinity of Heaven . He said that he would have begun writing these after finishing his work on the 12th and final main sequence book of The Wheel of Time . Jordan said , `` Infinity of Heaven almost certainly will be written before the prequels , though I might do them between the Infinity books . '' Also according to Dragonmount.com , Jordan planned to write some side-story novels , before completely abandoning his decades-long work .
The Sooty Barbthroat ( Threnetes niger ) is a hummingbird species in the family Trochilidae . It is found in French Guiana and far north-eastern Brazil . Its natural habitat is humid tropical lowland forest . Though fairly restricted in range , it is common enough to be considered a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN . The taxonomy and systematics of the Sooty\/Pale-tailed Barbthroat complex has caused much confusion . Some authors considered the Sooty Barbthroat to be a melanistic variant of the Pale-tailed Barbthroat ( T. leucurus ) . As T. niger was described first , this scientific name is considered the valid taxon for both . On the other hand , the SACC for example considers T. niger and T. leucurus distinct species , because of insufficient published evidence for their being conspecific . In addition , some suggest that the Bronze-tailed Barbthroat ( T. n. loehkeni ) should also be considered a valid species and include the doubtful Christina 's Barbthroat ( T. n. christinae ) as a subspecies . Freire 's Sooty Barbthroat ( T. n. freirei ) is intermediate between the Sooty and Bronze-tailed Barbthroats however , and thus its status needs to be clarified before the situation is resolved .
Yoshiyuki Matsuyama ( born July 31 , 1966 ) is a former Japanese football player . He has played for Japan national team .
Life Before Life : A Scientific Investigation of Children 's Memories of Previous Lives is a 2005 book written by psychiatrist Jim B. Tucker , which presents an overview of more than 40 years of reincarnation research at the University of Virginia Division of Personality Studies , into children 's reports of past life memories . The book also discusses `` birthmarks and birth defects that match those of a deceased person who is identified by the child '' . Life Before Life has been translated into ten languages and the foreword to the book is written by Ian Stevenson . This book challenges the notion that consciousness is only the result of a functioning brain . It suggests that consciousness can be considered separately from the brain , which provides a basis for claims of reincarnation . The book also discusses objections to reincarnation : the paucity of persons who actually claim to remember a past life , the fragility of memories , the population explosion , the mind-body problem , fraud , and others . Tucker recognizes that none of the cases examined are perfect , and `` faulty memory by informants '' is seen to be the `` best normal explanation for many of the cases '' reviewed in the book . Tucker discusses this , referring to several relevant studies which have been done , and argues that there is no support for the conclusion that informants must be remembering statements or events incorrectly . Tucker basically agrees with Ian Stevenson who said `` reincarnation is the best -- even though not the only -- explanation for the stronger cases we have investigated '' . Tucker recognizes that this may seem to be an `` astounding statement '' to some readersâ '' that `` memories , emotions and physical injuries can sometimes carry over from one life to the next '' . However , he argues that this is no more astounding than many currently accepted ideas in physics seemed to be when they were originally proposed . Life Before Life has been reviewed in several journals including the Journal of Parapsychology , Journal of Scientific Exploration , Philosophical Practice , and PsycCRITIQUES .
A mesocyclone is a vortex of air , approximately 2 to 10 miles in diameter ( the mesoscale of meteorology ) , within a convective storm . That is , it is air that rises and rotates around a vertical axis , usually in the same direction as low pressure systems in a given hemisphere . They are most often cyclonic , that is , associated with a localized low-pressure region within a severe thunderstorm . Such storms can feature strong surface winds and severe hail . Mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in supercells , where tornadoes may form . Mesocyclones are believed to form when strong changes of wind speed and\/or direction with height ( `` wind shear '' ) sets parts of the lower part of the atmosphere spinning in invisible tube-like rolls . The convective updraft of a thunderstorm is then thought to draw up this spinning air , tilting the rolls ' orientation upward ( from parallel to the ground to perpendicular ) and causing the entire updraft to rotate as a vertical column . Mesocyclones are normally relatively localized : they lie between the synoptic scale ( hundreds of kilometers ) and small scale ( hundreds of meters ) . Radar imagery is used to identify these features . Mesoscale convective systems ( MCS ) can develop mesoscale convective vortexes which can spur later development of either another MCS or a tropical cyclone . The best way to detect and verify the presence of a mesocyclone is by Doppler weather radar . Nearby high values of opposite sign within velocity data are how they are detected . Thus the word mesocyclone is associated with weather radar terminology . Mesocyclones are most often identified in the right-rear flank of supercell thunderstorms and squall lines , and may be distinguished by a hook echo rotation signature on a weather radar map . Visual cues such as a rotating wall cloud or tornado may also hint at the presence of a mesocyclone . This is why the term has entered into wider usage in connection with rotating features in severe storms . Mesocyclones are believed to form when strong changes of wind speed and\/or direction with height ( `` wind shear '' ) sets parts of the lower part of the atmosphere spinning in invisible tube-like rolls . The convective updraft of a thunderstorm is then thought to tilt upwards the layer of spinning air ( from parallel to the ground to perpendicular ) and causing the entire updraft to rotate as a vertical column . As the updraft rotates , it may form a wall cloud , a spinning layer of clouds descending from the mesocyclone . The wall cloud tends to form closer to the center of the mesocyclone . As it descends , a funnel-shaped cloud may form at its center . This is the first stage of tornado formation . The first explanation states that for tornadoes to begin to develop , two conditions must be first satisfied . One , an invisible horizontal spinning effect must be first formed upon the Earth 's surface . This is usually formed by sudden changes occurred in wind direction or speed , known as wind shear . Second , a thundercloud , or occasionally a cumulus cloud , must be present . During a thunderstorm , the updrafts presented are occasionally powerful enough to lift the horizontal spinning row of air upwards , turning it into a vertical air column . This vertical air column then becomes the basic structure for the tornado . Tornadoes that form in this way are often classified as weak tornadoes and ( generally ) last for less than 10 minutes . The second method of formation occurs during the occurrence of a supercell thunderstorm . This type of tornado forms by the updrafts present in the supercell thunderstorm . When winds occurring during this phenomenon increase and intensify , the force released can cause the updrafts to rotate . This rotating updraft is known as a mesocyclone . For a tornado to form in this manner , a downdraft called the rear-flank downdraft enters the center of the mesocyclone from the back . Cold air , being denser than warm air is able to penetrate through the updraft . The combination of the updraft and downdraft completes the development of a tornado . Tornadoes that form in this method are often classified as violent and are capable of lasting for more than one hour . A mesoscale convective vortex ( MCV ) , also known as a mesoscale vorticity center or Neddy eddy , is a mesocyclone within an mesoscale convective system ( MCS ) that pulls winds into a circling pattern , or vortex , at the mid levels of the troposphere and is normally associated with anticyclonic outflow aloft . With a core only 30 to 60 miles wide and 1 to 3 miles deep , an MCV is often overlooked in standard weather maps . MCVs can persist for up to 2 days after its parent mesoscale convective system has dissipated . The orphaned MCV can become the seed of the next thunderstorm outbreak . An MCV that moves into tropical waters , such as the Gulf of Mexico , can serve as the nucleus for a tropical storm or hurricane . MCVs can produce very large wind storms ; sometimes winds can reach over 100 mph . One notable MCV occurred on May 8 , 2009 .
Anderson da Silva Nilmar ( born September 19 , 1970 ) , known as Sonny or Anderson , is a former Brazilian footballer who played as a striker . A prolific goalscorer in the club level , he is best known for his spells with Olympique Lyonnais , AS Monaco ( he played most of his abroad career in France ) and FC Barcelona . Born in Goiatuba , GoiÃ s , Anderson started playing professionally with CR Vasco da Gama , but failed to make an early impression ; after failing to score in 18 matches in his last year , he moved to Guarani Futebol Clube . His first abroad experience came with Servette FC , and his impact was instant , scoring 20 goals in his first season , then helping the club to the national league in the following , bagging 11 in just the first half of the season , as he left in January 1994 to Olympique de Marseille . After six months , with L'OM relegated due to a bribery scandal , Anderson moved to fellow Ligue 1 team AS Monaco FC , scoring at an equally impressive pace , and winning team ( 1997 league ) and individual accolades alike . In 1997 , Sonny joined FC Barcelona . Having to battle for first-choice status with the likes of Luis Enrique and Patrick Kluivert , he fared well , netting 10 times in La Liga alone in his first season , as the Catalans won the double . In his second year , he played less , which prompted a return to France , with rising Olympique Lyonnais , for approximately â 18 millions . He would be a very important offensive figure as the team won the first two of seven consecutive national championships . Aged 33 , Anderson returned to Spain , with Villarreal CF . In his only full campaign , he scored 12 times , including against Real Madrid ( 1 â `` 0 , after only two minutes on the pitch ) , former side Barcelona ( 2 â `` 1 , in the 89th minute ) and Valencia CF ( 1 â `` 0 ) , while also helping the Yellow Submarine to the UEFA Cup semifinals . After being instrumental in Villarreal 's 2004 UEFA Intertoto Cup win , Sonny finished his career in Qatar . He then returned to Lyon , going on work with the team 's strikers . In June 2007 , he played a farewell match at the Stade de Gerland , in a match facing Sonny 's friends and the 2002 French champions . Anderson could not translate his club success to the international front . He only gained seven caps , the first coming in August 1997 , with South Korea .
Stal Mielec is a Polish football club based in Mielec , Poland . The club was established on April 10 , 1939 . The construction of the club 's current stadium , Stadion Stali Mielec at Solskiego 1 , was concluded in 1953 . Currently the stadium is undergoing a major renovation . It maintains a seating capacity for 30,000 spectators and has hosted numerous European Champions Cup , UEFA Cup , and Polish national team matches , including FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championship qualifiers . Historically , the club has enjoyed great successes within Poland 's Ekstraklasa Premier League , winning the title twice ( in 1973 and 1976 ) , but has undergone significant management changes and financial difficulties within the past two decades that have forced the club from participation in the Premier League . It currently participates in the Polish Third League .

Sangerhausen is a town in Saxony-Anhalt , Germany , capital of the district of Mansfeld-S Ã 1\/4 dharz , without being part of it . It is situated southeast of the Harz , approx . 35 km east of Nordhausen , and 50 km west of Halle ( Saale ) . in Sangerhausen live about 31 000 people . Sangerhausen is one of the oldest towns in the historical region of Thuringia , being mentioned in a document of 991 as appertaining to the estates of the emperor . By marriage it passed to the landgrave of Thuringia , and after 1056 it formed for a while an independent country . Having been again part of Thuringia , it fell in 1249 to Meissen , and in 1291 to Brandenburg . In 1372 it passed to Saxony and formed a portion of that territory until 1815 , when it was united with Prussia . On 1 January 2008 , the municipality of Wippra was incorporated . In the vicinity are the famous KyffhÃ user Monument and the so-called Barbarossa Cave , the only anhydrite cave in Europe which can be visited by tourists . Sangerhausen is also home to the Europa-Rosarium , the largest collection of roses in the world , created in 1903 .
The Tokaimura nuclear accident , which occurred on 30 September 1999 , resulted in two deaths . At that time , it was Japan 's worst civilian nuclear radiation accident . The criticality accident occurred in a uranium reprocessing facility operated by JCO ( formerly Japan Nuclear Fuel Conversion Co. ) , a subsidiary of Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. in the village of TÅ kai , Naka District , Ibaraki . The accident occurred as three workers were preparing a small batch of fuel for the JÅ yÅ experimental fast breeder reactor , using uranium enriched to 18.8 % with the fissionable radionuclide ( radioisotope ) known as U235 ( with the remainder being the non-fissile U238 ) . It was JCO 's first batch of fuel for that reactor in three years , and no proper qualification and training requirements appear to have been established to prepare those workers for the job . At around 10:35 a.m. , a precipitation tank reached critical mass when its fill level , containing about 16 kg of uranium , reached about 40 litres . Criticality was reached upon the technicians adding a seventh bucket of uranium solution to the tank . The nuclear fission chain reaction became self-sustaining and began to emit intense gamma and neutron radiation . The technicians , one of whom had his body draped over the tank , observed a blue flash of Cherenkov radiation and gamma-radiation alarms sounded . The two technicians closest to the tank immediately experienced pain , nausea , difficulty breathing , and other symptoms . The technician closest to the tank lost consciousness in the decontamination room a few minutes later and began to vomit . There was no explosion , but fission products ( fission fragments of U235 with atomic masses typically around 95 and 137 , such as yttrium94 and barium140 ) were progressively released inside the building . Being a wet process with an intended liquid result , the water promoted the chain reaction by serving as a neutron moderator , whereby neutrons emitted from fissioned nuclei are slowed so they are more readily absorbed by neighboring nuclei , inducing them to fission in turn . The criticality continued intermittently for about 20 hours . As the solution boiled vigorously , steam bubbles attenuated the liquid water 's action as a neutron moderator ( see Void coefficient ) and the solution lost criticality . However , the reaction resumed as the solution cooled and the voids disappeared . The following morning , workers permanently stopped the reaction by draining water from a cooling jacket surrounding the precipitation tank since that water was serving as a neutron reflector . A boric acid solution ( boron being a good neutron absorber ) was then added to the tank to ensure that the contents remained subcritical . These operations exposed 27 workers to radioactivity . The direct cause of the criticality accident was workers putting uranyl nitrate solution containing about 16 kg of uranium , which exceeded the critical mass , into a precipitation tank . The tank was not designed to hold this type of solution and was not configured to prevent criticality . The exact critical mass for the 18.8 % uranium mixture in the Tokaimura tank is not known . In the Joyo reactor , the minimum critical mass for solid ( dry ) 18.8 % uranium fuel is about 46 kg ( 101 lbs ) , but the critical mass is greatly reduced when the fuel is in solution , or otherwise provided with a surrounding neutron attenuator\/reflector , as was the case at Tokaimura . Five hours after the start of the criticality , evacuation commenced of some 161 people from 39 households within a 350 meter radius from the conversion building . Residents were allowed home two days later after sandbags and other shielding ensured no hazard from residual gamma radiation . Twelve hours after the start of the incident residents within 10 km were asked to stay indoors as a precautionary measure , and this restriction was lifted the following afternoon . Dozens of emergency workers and nearby residents were hospitalized and hundreds of thousands of others were forced to remain indoors for 24 hours . At least 667 workers , emergency responders , and nearby residents were exposed to excess radiation as a result of the accident . A dose of 50 millisieverts ( mSv ) is the maximum allowable annual dose for Japanese nuclear workers . For context , 8000 mSv ( 800 rem ) is normally a fatal dose and more than 10,000 mSv is almost invariably fatal . Normal background radiation amounts to an annual exposure of about 3 mSv . There were 56 plant workers whose exposures ranged up to 23 mSv and a further 21 workers received elevated doses when draining the precipitation tank . Seven workers immediately outside the plant received doses estimated at 6 â `` 15 mSv ( combined neutron and gamma effects ) . The three operators ' doses were far above permissible limits at 3,000 , 10,000 , and 17,000 mSv ; the two receiving the higher doses later died . The most severely exposed worker had his body draped over the tank when it went critical . He suffered serious burns to most of his body , experienced severe damage to his internal organs , and had a near-zero white blood cell count . The cause of the accident was said to be `` human error and serious breaches of safety principles '' , according to the International Atomic Energy Agency .
VÃ ttern is the second largest lake ( by surface area ) in Sweden , after Lake VÃ nern and the sixth largest lake in Europe . It is a long , finger-shaped body of fresh water in south central Sweden to the southeast of VÃ nern pointing at the tip of Scandinavia . One of the etymologies for name VÃ ttern is from `` vatten '' , the Swedish word for water . This origin is , however , unclear and in dispute . It has also been suggested that the archaic term `` vÃ tter '' , meaning forest or lake spirits , is the origin of the lake 's name . The lake 's total surface area is about 1,912 kmÂ , with a drainage basin a little over double that , about 4,503 kmÂ . The deepest known point , located to the south of the island of VisingsÃ , is 128 meters . The average depth is 40 meters . The lake has a perimeter of about 642 km . The volume is 74 kmÂ . These numbers tend to be fixed , as the level of the lake is regulated . Situated in GÃ taland , the lake is drained by Motala strÃ m , starting at Motala , and flowing ultimately through a controlled canal into the Baltic Sea . The lake includes the scenic island of VisingsÃ , located outside GrÃ nna . Other towns on the lake include Vadstena , JÃ nkÃ ping , Hjo , Askersund , Ã mmeberg and Karlsborg . It is bounded by the Provinces of VÃ stergÃ tland , NÃ rke , Ã -- stergÃ tland and SmÃ land . In the north there is a scenic but not mountainous inland fjord , Alsen . About 62 % of the drainage basin is still covered with spruce , pine and deciduous forest . About 26.7 % is dedicated to agriculture . The geology of the lake is closely bound to that of the Baltic Sea , of which it was often part . The lake , with VÃ nern , was part of a connecting waterway system through central Sweden to the Skagerrak several times in the recent geological past . Lake VÃ ttern is located in a graben that was formed by crustal movements in the east-west direction 40 to 50 Mya . During the most recent millions of years multiple glaciations have covered the lake and its surroundings , leaving glacial striations and drumlins as they receded . The present-day lake began as an independent body of water left by the receding Scandinavian glacier after the last glacial period around 10,000 BP . It soon became a minor bay of the Baltic ice lake . Most of the lake 's relict species ( like the arctic char ) date from this time . Subsequently it was a bay of Yoldia Sea and then became connected to Ancylus Lake , discharging from the north end of its extent . At about 8000 BP an accident of the uneven Scandinavian isostatic land rise brought VÃ ttern above Ancylus and the two became distinct . The annual post-glacial rebound today is 3.5 mm in northeastern Motala and 2.6 mm in southern JÃ nkÃ ping . This means that lake VÃ ttern is tilting to the south by one millimeter every year . The lake contains both phytoplankton and zooplankton , such as Copepoda and Cladocera . The benthos species include Crustacea , Oligochaeta , Diptera and Bivalvia . In addition are several species of fish , including Salvelinus salvelinus , Coregonus lavaretus and Salmo salar . The lake is known for its VÃ ttern char , as it is called , Salvelinus alpinus . It is said that there 's a lake monster inhabiting VÃ ttern . This is however not nearly as famous as the one supposedly living in StorsjÃ n. VÃ ttern has been famous for the excellent quality of its transparent water . Many of the municipalities in the area receive their drinking water directly from VÃ ttern . The lake water requires very little treatment before being pumped into the municipal systems and the natural , untreated water can be safely drunk from almost any point in the lake . It has been suggested that VÃ ttern is the largest body of potable water in the world . The surrounding municipalities process their sewage 100 % . VÃ ttern is known for the annual recreational cycling race VÃ tternrundan , attracting some 20,000 participants to finish the 300 km trip around the shores of the lake . VÃ ttern is also noted for its fishing , serving people in the nearby districts . Tourist sport fishermen and vacationers are free to fish in the lake as long as they do n't use nets . The lake is also used for commercial fishing . A number of industries provide employment in the drainage basin : mining , manufacturing , forestry and paper . Agriculturalists raise cattle , sheep , swine and poultry . Ingmar Bergman shot a scene in his classic film Wild Strawberries on a restaurant terrace overlooking Lake VÃ ttern .
Maicon Douglas Sisenando ( born 26 July 1981 in Novo Hamburgo ) , commonly known as Maicon , is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a right back for Italian Serie A club Internazionale . A talented right sided full back many consider to be the finest player of this generation , Maicon debuted for Cruzeiro in 2001 and after two successful seasons in Brazil which included winning a championship and being called up for the Brazilian national team in 2003 , he was signed by French club Monaco in June 2004 . In July 2006 , Internazionale officially announced the signing of Maicon on a five-year contract along with fellow Brazilian fullback Maxwell and French midfielder Olivier Dacourt . During his time at Inter , he has established himself as a reliable wing-back , solid defensively with an ability of making emphatic runs down the right wing , often setting up for goals or scoring himself with his powerful right foot . He has overtaken Inter captain Javier Zanetti as first choice right back . He is generally considered as one of the best wing-backs in the game and is first choice in the Brazil national team , ahead of FC Barcelona defender Daniel Alves . During a UEFA Champions League match on March 6 , 2007 , he was involved in a brawl with Valencia defender David Navarro . Maicon was originally banned for six matches , but the ban was reduced to three . A regular under former coach JosÃ Mourinho , he contributed his fair share of assists and goals as Inter won a fourth consecutive title in the 2008 â `` 09 season , including a match-winning brace against Siena . He has continued the good form he displayed in previous seasons during the 2009\/2010 season . He started the season by scoring a goal against Milan in the 4 â `` 0 derby victory , and then playing well against Barcelona in a 0 â `` 0 draw at the Giuseppe Meazza . He subsequently set up Diego Milito on matchday 5 against Napoli , as Inter defeated Napoli with 3 â `` 1 . He also scored the last goal in a 5 â `` 0 win over Genoa . He also made a fantastic byline run which resulted in Milito 's match killing goal in a 5 â `` 3 home victory over Palermo and the very next match he scored the killer goal against A.S. Livorno Calcio , which ended 2 â `` 0 for Inter . During Inter 's home leg of the Derby d'Italia , the right back opened the scoring against Juventus with one of the most spectacular goals of the season , juggling a loose ball over the onrushing defender at the top of the penalty box and volleying it into the opposite corner . Later that month Maicon scored his first UEFA Champions League goal against reigning champions FC Barcelona when Internazionale registered a famous victory over the Catalans . He reportedly knocked out a tooth after he collided with fellow South American Lionel Messi . FC Internazionale have continued with good form and have bagged a historical treble this season . Having overtaken Roma at the summit of the Serie A , Inter went on to knock out FC Barcelona from the Champions League with Maicon earning praise for the way he marked Iniesta and Messi out of the game . Inter won the Copa Italia final against Roma . Maicon 's contributions to Inter Milan have included staunch defending and offensive support , and have placed him in contention for the 2010 Ballon d'Or . On May 22 , 2010 Internazionale won the UEFA Champions League , thus completing the Treble with a 2 â `` 0 victory over Bayern Munich in the final at the Santiago Bernabeu . He was named the 2009-2010 UEFA Club Defender of the Year .
The TÃ naiste ( ; plural : TÃ naistÃ ( Ë tÉ ` Ë nÉ Ê tÊ iË ) ) , or , more formally , An TÃ naiste , is the deputy prime minister of Ireland . The Taoiseach ( prime minister ) nominates a member of the government to the position of TÃ naiste . The current TÃ naiste is Eamon Gilmore . TÃ naiste was originally the Irish word for the heir of the chief ( taoiseach ) or king ( rÃ ) , under the Gaelic system of tanistry . Before independence , the British Viceroy was sometimes referred to in the Irish language as An TÃ naiste-R Ã , literally ` the deputy king ' . The office was created in the 1937 Constitution of Ireland , replacing the previous office of Vice-President of the Executive Council that had existed under the Free State constitution . The TÃ naiste acts in the place of the Taoiseach during his or her temporary absence , and , until a successor has been appointed , in the event of the Taoiseach 's death or permanent incapacitation . The TÃ naiste must be a member of DÃ il Ã ireann , and is ex-officio a member of the Council of State . The TÃ naiste would usually chair meetings of the government if the Taoiseach is absent or take questions on his behalf in the DÃ il or Seanad . Aside from these duties , the title is largely honorific in practice . The constitution does not give the TÃ naiste specific powers other than deputising for the Taoiseach . Under a coalition government the position is commonly held by the leader of the second-largest party who in this situation is free to head any department he or she wants . Recent TÃ naistÃ , such as Michael McDowell , Mary Harney and Dick Spring , have been leaders of smaller parties . In a single-party government the TÃ naiste is often an ` elder statesman ' holding one of the less important ministerial portfolios .
The Saturn Award is an award presented annually by the Academy of Science Fiction , Fantasy & Horror Films to honor the top works in science fiction , fantasy , and horror in film , television , and home video . The Saturn Awards were devised by Dr. Donald A. Reed in 1972 , who felt that films within those genres were never given the appreciation they deserved at that time . The physical award is a representation of the planet Saturn , surrounded with a ring of film . The award was initially and is still sometimes loosely referred to as a Golden Scroll . Similar to other awards , like the Oscars , the Emmys and the Grammys , the Saturn Awards are voted on by members of the presenting Academy . The academy is a non-profit organization with membership open to the public . The first awards were presented in 1972 by William Shatner . Although the awards still primarily nominate films and TV in the science fiction , fantasy and horror categories , the Saturns have also recognized productions in standard dramatic genres . The 35th annual awards , presented in 2009 , for example , included nominations for films ranging from the 1940s wartime classic Casablanca to the 2008 film Slumdog Millionaire . There are also special awards for lifetime achievement in the field . In addition there was an Award for Best Foreign Film in 1980 . The only winner in that category was Dinner for Adele ( 1977 ) .
British Rail Class 416 ( 2EPB ) electric multiple units were built between 1953 and 1956 . They were intended for inner suburban passenger services on London 's Southern Electric network . There were two subclasses of class 416 : class 416\/1 to an SR design on salvaged 2Nol underframes , and class 416\/2 to BR 's Mark I coach design . In the 1980s some units were used on the North London Line between Richmond and North Woolwich . Fifteen units built in 1954\/5 to the BR Mark I coach design were built for the third rail electrified Tyneside Electric lines . They were built at Eastleigh , and were the last Tyneside third rail EMUs built . They followed the new British Railways standard design for suburban rolling stock : similar units were built at the same time for use on South London suburban routes , but the Tyneside units had features in keeping with previous Tyneside EMUs , such as a large brake van to accommodate a large volume of fish boxes and prams ; electric headcode lights on the cab front between the windows ; and above those a roller destination blind . Unlike units of this style built for service in the south , the Tyneside units had a single first class compartment . The units operated the South Tyneside services between Newcastle Central and South Shields , a route that had a busy commuter frequency and passenger numbers to match . British Rail decided to withdraw electric traction from these routes and the South Tyneside route was the first to be replaced by diesel units , being de-electrified in 1963 . All 15 units were re-allocated to South London , Kent , Surrey and Berkshire , which entailed some rebuilding of the cabs and the declassification of the first class compartment . The units continued in passenger service until 1985 when they were all withdrawn . A number of units survived for a few years longer on non-passenger duties as test or tractor units . One was used for testing the Tonbridge - Hastings line electrification before the route was opened for electric trains in the summer of 1986 . This unit also carried out similar work on the East Grinstead electrification two years later and saw occasional use on other test and tractor duties until laid up in 1995 , by which time it was the only South Tyneside unit left . It was purchased for preservation by SERA and was moved to Robertsbridge in Sussex for initial restoration work , and moved to the Coventry Railway Centre in 1999 . The work of the association in restoring the unit back to its ` as built ' condition is both costly and time-consuming but is being progressed by a dedicated team of SERA volunteers . It is hoped to bring the unit on a return visit to the North East when the restoration is completed . This unique survivor is a treasured example of a bygone age of suburban rail travel in the North East . The 416\/1 subclass ( 5651-5684 ) was rebuilt at Eastleigh Works in 1959 using underframes from withdrawn SR Class 2NOL units . The rebuilt units were initially classified 2NOP but later absorbed into the 2EPB classification . They had SR-designed bodies , similar to those of the earlier SR-design 4SUB units and Bulleid locomotive-hauled coaching stock . Each motor car had two 250 horsepower English Electric EE507 traction motors . The final units were withdrawn in 1995 . Three units have been preserved . Bachmann has announced that it will be releasing an 00 gauge model of a BR-design 2-EPB ( 416\/2 ) .
The Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company ( BRC&W ) was a railway locomotive and carriage builder , founded in Birmingham , England and , for most of its existence , located at nearby Smethwick , with the factory was divided by the boundary between the two places . The company was established in 1854 . BRC&W made not only carriages and wagons , but a range of vehicles , from aeroplanes and military gliders to buses , trolleybuses and tanks . Nevertheless , it is as a builder of railway rolling stock that the company is best remembered , exporting to most parts of the new and old worlds . It supplied vehicles to all four of the pre-nationalisation `` big four '' railway companies ( LMS , SR , LNER and GWR ) , British Rail , Pullman ( some of which are still in use ) and Wagons-Lits , plus railways as diverse as those in Egypt , India , South Africa , Iraq , Malaya and Nigeria , to name but a few . The company even built , in 1910 , Argentina 's presidential coach , which still survives , and once carried Eva PerÃ n. The company built hospital trains during the Second Boer War , Handley Page bombers and Airco DH10s in 1914-1918 , and tanks ( including the A10 Cruiser , Churchill tank , Cromwell tank and Challenger ) , plus Hamilcar gliders in 1939-1945 . Before World War II , the company had built steam - , petrol - and diesel-powered railcars for overseas customers , not to mention bus bodies for Midland Red , and afterwards developed more motive power products , including BR 's Class 26 , Class 33 ( both diesel ) and Class 81 ( electric ) locomotives . Examples of all three types are preserved . In the years running up to 1963 the company had built an extensive number of locomotives , multiple units , and Underground cars , but then rapidly got into financial difficulties , and the business closed down . The self-funded prototype `` Lion '' main line locomotive was a particular disappointment , powered by a Sulzer 2,750 hp diesel engine , it was pitted against another self-funded prototype `` Falcon '' built by Brush at Loughborough which had twin 1,400 hp Maybach engines ; after trials British Railways preferred the BRCW approach , but ordered them to be built by the Brush company .
The Second International ( 1889 -- 1916 ) was an organization of socialist and labor parties formed in Paris on July 14 , 1889 . At the Paris meeting delegations from 20 countries participated . It continued the work of the dissolved First International , though excluding the still-powerful anarcho-syndicalist movement and unions , and was in existence until 1916 . Among the Second International 's famous actions were its ( 1889 ) declaration of May 1 as International Workers ' Day and its ( 1910 ) declaration of March 8 as International Women 's Day . It initiated the international campaign for the 8-hour working day . The International 's permanent executive and information body was the International Socialist Bureau ( ISB ) , based in Brussels and formed after the International 's Paris Congress of 1900 . Emile Vandervelde and Camille Huysmans of the Belgian Labor Party were its chair and secretary . Vladimir Ilyich Lenin was a member from 1905 . The Second International dissolved during World War I , in 1916 , as the separate national parties that composed it did not maintain a unified front against the war , instead generally supporting their respective nations ' role . French Section of the Workers ' International ( SFIO ) leader Jean JaurÃ s 's assassination , a few days before the beginning of the war , symbolized the failure of the antimilitarist doctrine of the Second International . In 1915 , at the Zimmerwald Conference , anti-war socialists attempted to maintain international unity against the social patriotism of the social democratic leaders . The International continued in skeleton form in neutral Switzerland through the war , as the Berne International . In 1920 , the defunct Second International was reorganized . However , some European socialist parties refused to join the reorganized international , and decided instead to form the International Working Union of Socialist Parties ( IWUSP ) ( `` Second and a half International '' or `` Two-and-a-half International '' ) , heavily influenced by Austromarxism . In 1923 , IWUSP and the Second International merged to form the social democratic Labor and Socialist International . This international continued to exist until 1940 . After World War II , the Socialist International was formed to continue the policies of the Labor and Socialist International , and it continues to this day . Anarchists tended to be excluded from the Second International , nevertheless `` anarchism had in fact dominated the London Congress of the Second International '' . This exclusion received the criticism from other non-marxists present at the meetings . It has been argued that at some point the Second International turned `` into a battleground over the issue of libertarian versus authoritarian socialism . Not only did they effectively present themselves as champions of minority rights ; they also provoked the German Marxists into demonstrating a dictatorial intolerance which was a factor in preventing the British labor movement from following the Marxist direction indicated by such leaders as H. M. Hyndman '' . In Latin America , the International had two affiliates ; the Socialist Party of Argentina and the Socialist Party of Uruguay .
Roger Charles Louis Guillemin ( born January 11 , 1924 in Dijon , Bourgogne , France ) received the National Medal of Science in 1976 , and the Nobel prize for medicine in 1977 for his work on neurohormones , sharing the prize that year with Andrew Schally and Rosalyn Sussman Yalow . Completing his undergraduate work at the University of Burgundy , Guillemin received his M.D. degree from the Medical Faculty at Lyon in 1949 , and went to Montreal , Quebec , Canada , to work with Hans Selye at the Institute of Experimental Medicine and Surgery at the UniversitÃ de MontrÃ alwhere he received a Ph. D. in 1953 . The same year he moved to the United States to join the faculty at Baylor College of Medicine at Houston . In 1965 , he became a naturalized citizen of the United States . In 1970 he helped in creating the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California where he worked until retirement in 1989 . Guillemin and Andrew V. Schally discovered the structures of TRH and GnRH in separate laboratories . Guillemin signed along with other Nobel Prize winners a petition requesting that a delegation of the Committee on the Rights of the Children of the United Nations may visit a Tibetan child who is under house arrest in China since 1995 , namely Gendhun Choekyi Nyima , recognized as the 11th Panchen Lama by the 14th Dalai Lama , Tenzin Gyatso .
Loftus Versfeld Stadium is a rugby and football stadium situated in Pretoria , Gauteng , South Africa . The stadium has a capacity of 51,762 for rugby union and recently hosted the 2009 Currie Cup final . It is occasionally used for local football matches as well . In June 2010 , the stadium hosted opening round games and one game of the round of 16 of the 2010 FIFA World Cup . The stadium was named after Robert Owen Loftus Versfeld , the founder of organized sports in Pretoria . Through the years the stadium has undergone various name changes as sponsors came and went , though locals have always referred to the stadium as Loftus Versfeld . From 11 June 1998 to 4 February 2003 the stadium was officially named Minolta Loftus after Minolta had become the stadium 's name sponsor . Sponsorship was taken over by security giant Securicor , who announced the name Securicor Loftus on 5 February 2003 . On the 1st of September 2005 the renaming process went full circle when cellular provider Vodacom , taking over sponsorship from Securicor , renamed the stadium back to the original Loftus Versfeld . The site of the stadium was first used for sports in 1906 , and the field was simply called the Eastern Sports Ground . The first concrete structure was erected there by the City Council in 1923 . The original structure could only accommodate 2000 spectators , and did not have proper sports facilities . In 1928 , mostly because of the All Blacks tour to South Africa that year , the Pretoria sub-union made a large profit which they used to erect changing rooms and toilets . When Mr Loftus Versfeld died suddenly in May 1932 the Pretoria sub-union renamed the Eastern Sports Ground after him as a tribute to a man that had done so much to develop sport in the area . The stadium has been known as Loftus Versfeld Stadium ever since . It has been upgraded on several occasions , most recently in 1984 , when the Northern Pavilion received an upgrade . Loftus hosted some matches during the 1995 Rugby World Cup . Loftus was one of the venues for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup . It hosted the Group B matches USA vs. Italy , USA vs. Brazil and Brazil vs. Italy . Minimal upgrading was undertaken in order for Loftus Versfeld to qualify as a venue for first and second round matches for the 2010 FIFA World Cup . The floodlights , sound system , scoreboards and stadium roof were improved and , while expected to be finished in August 2008 , renovation was completed in January 2009 . Loftus Versfeld is the home ground of the Super 14 franchise the Bulls and was the site of the 2009 Super 14 Final . Loftus is also the home ground of the Blue Bulls union in South Africa 's Currie Cup . The stadium has currently been upgraded as part of the 2010 World Cup , with new roofing on the eastern stand as well as roads and parking facilities around it The stadium has hosted many musical events over the past few years including UB40 and Robbie Williams ' Close Encounters Tour on 17 April 2006 with an attendance of over 56,000 . Canadian superstar Celine Dion also performed as part of her Taking Chances Tour a two-night stand at the stadium on 16 and 17 February 2008 with a total attendance of about 80,000 .
Quintana Roo officially Estado Libre y Soberano de Quintana Roo is one of the 31 states that , with the Federal District , comprise the 32 federative entities of Mexico . Located on the eastern part of the YucatÃ n Peninsula , it borders the States of YucatÃ n and Campeche to the north and west , the Caribbean Sea to the east , and the nation of Belize to the south . Quintana Roo also claims territory which gives it a small border with Guatemala in the south west of the state , although this disputed area is also claimed by Campeche . The capital of Quintana Roo is the city of Chetumal . Quintana Roo also contains the resort city of CancÃ n , the islands of Cozumel and Isla Mujeres , the towns of Bacalar , Felipe Carrillo Puerto , Playa del Carmen , Puerto JuÃ rez , Akumal , Xcalak , and Puerto Morelos , as well as the ancient Maya ruins of Chacchoben , ChakanbakÃ n , Chamax , Coba , DzibanchÃ , El Meco , IchpaatÃ n , Kohunlich , Muyil , Oxtankah , Tancah , Tulum , Tupak , Xel-H Ã , and Xcaret . The Sian Ka ` an Biosphere Reserve is also in Quintana Roo . The state covers an area of , and the 2005 census reported a population of 1,135,309 . The statewide population is currently expanding at a rapid rate due to the construction of hotels and the demand for workers . Many immigrants to the state come from YucatÃ n , Campeche , Tabasco , and Veracruz . The state , known as a resort area , is frequently hit by severe hurricanes due to its exposed location , the most recent and severe being Hurricane Dean in 2007 , making landfall with sustained winds of 280 km\/h ( 175 mph ) , with gusts up to 320 km\/h ( 200 mph ) . The state is named after the Mexican patriot AndrÃ s Quintana Roo . The State of Quintana Roo is divided into 9 municipalities , each headed by a municipal president . Quintana Roo 's tourist boom began in the 1970s . Tourism resulted in the development of coastal hotels and resorts , in addition to ecotourism inland and in coastal regions , which have increased the development of the region as well as increased the gross domestic product . Quintana Roo ranks sixth among Mexican states according to the United Nations Human Development index ( HDI ) . The YucatÃ n Peninsula is one of the most forested areas of the world when considering biotic mass per hectare . Yet , anthropological , biological and governmental experts have determined that Quintana Roo is ` facing a faunal crisis ' . Many medium to large game animals are disappearing due to hunting and habitat loss . Animals dependent on old growth forests are quickly becoming extinct . While its population is relatively small , Quintana Roo is experiencing both a migratory population influx and an increase in tourism . This only increases the pressure on the plants and animals native to Quintana Roo . There are four generalized ecosystems in Quintana Rooâ '' tropical forests , or jungle , savanna , mangrove forests , and coral reefs . One of the byproducts of traditional and large-scale agriculture is the creation of additional habitats , such as second growth forests and fields\/pastures . Tourism has caused Quintana Roo to become famous around the world in the last thirty or so years for its beaches and coastline . Biological experts consider the coastline of Quintana Roo one of the best manatee habitats worldwide . Queen conchs are also noted for their inhabitation of coastal territory . The wide variety of biotic organisms such as these has decreased drastically in the last fifteen years . Also affected by the loss of habitat due to both agriculture and development , birds are one of the regions most varied animal assets . Hundreds of species reside in Quintana Roo permanently , with still hundreds of others either wintering there or using it as a stop over on the long journey into South America . As a result , many birders come to the area annually search of the rare and unexpected . Many debates on the cause of the environmental damage in Quintana Roo look to point a finger , either at the regional government or to outside investors . However , resorts and hotels at Quintana Roo have created jobs and increased economic activity , which in turn has resulted in growth for Quintana Roo . Many credit ecotourism for both saving and supporting the ecological beauty and variety . Projections for the tourism economy of Quintana Roo were exceedingly optimistic . It houses multiple tourist attractions from the Maya ruins to the lush forests to the beautiful beaches . However , long-term effects were not calculated or foreseen . The effect on the local environment was not properly considered . Economic stresses of development and population were virtually ignored . The effect on the native population was not properly considered . The ` economic marginalization ' of the Maya has had drastic effects on their sense of place and identity . For tourism to truly benefit the region of Quintana Roo , attention must go to both the environment and the area 's original occupants .

Ve ( Ð ' Ð ; italics : Ð ' Ð ) is a letter of the Cyrillic alphabet . It commonly represents the voiced labiodental fricative \/ v \/ , like the pronunciation of â vâ in `` very '' . The capital letter Ve is shaped exactly like the capital Latin letter B but is pronounced differently . Ve is usually romanized using the Latin letter V , but sometimes using the Latin letter W. Ve and the Cyrillic letter Be ( Ð ` Ð ) were both derived from the Greek letter Beta ( Î ' Î ) , which already represented \/ v \/ in Greek by the time the Cyrillic alphabet was created . In the Early Cyrillic alphabet its name was ( vÄ dÄ ) , meaning `` I know '' . In the Cyrillic numeral system , Ve had the value of 2 . In Russian and Bulgarian , Ve generally represents \/ v \/ , but at the end of a word or before voiceless consonants it represents the voiceless ( f ) and before a palatalizing vowel it represents \/ vÊ \/ . In standard Ukrainian pronunciation ( based on the Poltava dialect ) , Ve represents a sound like the English W ( ( w ) ) when in the word final position . Because of this , it is not uncommon to see words ending in â Ð â transcribed to end in â wâ , for example , = Vladyslaw for Vladislav . Additionally , some Ukrainians also use such pronunciation in words where the letter is directly preceded by a consonant , while for others all occurrences of the letter Ve denote ( w ) . In Eastern Ukraine , the letter Ve may represent a voiceless ( f ) , but this is considered a Russification , as word final devoicing does not occur in standard Ukrainian . For example , the standard Ukrainian pronunciation of the word ( being said ) is \/ skazaw \/ . However in Eastern Ukraine one is likely to hear the Russified ( skazaf ) ( with final devoicing ) . In Belarusian , the letter Ve represents only the sound \/ v \/ . In the word final position , or if directly proceeded by a consonant , it mutates to the letter Short U ( Ð Ñ ) , a Belarusian letter representing the sound \/ w \/ . E.g. , the Belarusian noun `` language '' is ( mova ) , but the adjectival form is ( mowny ) , and the genitive plural of the noun ( formed by removing the final â Ð â ) is ( mow ) . In Serbian , the letter Ve represents only the sound \/ v \/ .
Quentin Saxby Blake , CBE , FCSD , RDI , ( born 16 December 1932 ) is an English cartoonist , illustrator and children 's author , well known for his collaborations with writer Roald Dahl . Blake was educated at Chislehurst and Sidcup Grammar School . His English teacher , JH Walsh , influenced his ambition to become involved in literature . His first published drawing was for the satirical magazine Punch , at the age of 16 . He read English Literature at Downing College , Cambridge ( 1953-6 ) , received his postgraduate teaching diploma from the University of London , and later studied at the Chelsea School of Art . He gained another teaching diploma at the Institute of Education before working at the Royal College of Art . Blake gained a reputation as a reliable and humorous illustrator of over 300 children 's books . As well as illustrating the books of others , including Roald Dahl and Elizabeth Bowen , Blake has written numerous books of his own . As of 2006 , he has participated in the writing and\/or illustrating of 323 books ( of which he wrote 35 himself , and 18 were by Dahl ) . He taught at the Royal College of Art for over twenty years , and was head of the Illustration department from 1978 to 1986 . He recently illustrated David Walliams 's debut book , ` The Boy in the Dress ' and his more recent book ` Mr Stink ' . His distinct artistic style uses fast , scribbly ink lines , but with a precise stroke . His idiosyncratic use of line adds depth to his drawings , conveying movement and emotions by creating images with a sense of excitement . First , he makes pen-and-ink drawings , and then adds watercolor . The spontaneity of his style is achieved by making a draft image with a free hand at first , and then tracing elements via light table from the first draft onto subsequent drafts . With Russell Hoban , he was awarded the 1974 Whitbread Award for Children 's Book for How Tom Beat Captain Najork and His Hired Sportsmen . Blake was appointed an OBE in 1988 , and subsequently a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2005 New Year 's Honours List , for services to Children 's Literature . Since 1989 , he has been visiting professor at the Royal College of Art . In 1999 he was made the UK 's first Children 's Laureate . In 2002 he was awarded the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for his contributions to children 's book illustration . Blake has been awarded 12 honorary degrees , including an honorary degree by Cambridge University in 2005 , and honorary doctorates from the Institute of Education , Loughborough University , the Open University and Anglia Ruskin University in 2006 â `` 7 . In the 1970s Blake was an occasional presenter of the BBC children 's story-telling program Jackanory , in which he would illustrate the stories on a canvas as he was telling them . Blake is patron of the Blake Society , Downing College 's arts and humanities society . He is also a patron of `` The Big Draw '' which aims to get people drawing throughout the UK , and of The Nightingale Project , a charity that puts art into hospitals . Since 2006 he has produced work for several hospitals and health centres in the London area and one in Paris . In 2007 he designed a huge mural on fabric , suspended over and thus disguising a ramshackle building immediately opposite an entrance to St Pancras railway station . The rendering of an `` imaginary welcoming committee '' greets passengers arriving on the Eurostar high-speed railway . Blake is also the designer of ` Ben ' , the logo used for the expanding cookie shop chain , Ben 's Cookies . Blake is a supporter and Ambassador for the indigenous rights NGO , Survival International . In 2009 , he said , `` For me , Survival is important for two reasons ; one is that I think itâ s right that we should give help and support to people who are threatened by the rapacious industrial society we have created ; and the other that , more generally , it gives an important signal about how we all ought to be looking after the world . Its message is the most fundamental of any charity Iâ m connected with . '' This is a list only of books both written and illustrated by Blake .
Bugzilla is a Web-based general-purpose bugtracker and testing tool originally developed and used by the Mozilla project , and licensed under the Mozilla Public License . Released as open source software by Netscape Communications in 1998 , it has been adopted by a variety of organizations for use as a bug tracking system and occasionally as a data source to a project management software . It is used for both free and open source software and proprietary projects and products . Bugzilla was originally written by Terry Weissman in 1998 for the nascent Mozilla.org project , as an open source application to replace the in-house system then in use at Netscape Communications for tracking defects in the Netscape Communicator suite . Originally written in Tcl , Terry decided to port Bugzilla to Perl before its release as part of Netscape 's early open source code drops , with the hopes that more people would be able to contribute to it as Perl seemed to be a more popular language at the time . Bugzilla 2.0 was the result of that port to Perl , and the first version released to the public via anonymous CVS . In April 2000 , Weissman handed off control of the Bugzilla project to Tara Hernandez . Under Tara 's leadership , some of the regular contributors were coerced into taking more responsibility , and Bugzilla development became more community-driven . In July 2001 , facing distraction from her other responsibilities in Netscape , Tara handed off control to Dave Miller , who was still in charge as of 2007 . Bugzilla 3.0 was released on May 10 , 2007 and brought refreshed UI , XML-RPC interface , custom fields and resolutions , mod_perl support , shared saved searches , improved UTF-8 support and others . Bugzilla 4.0 was released on February 15 , 2011 . Currently supported database systems are MySQL , PostgreSQL , and Oracle . Bugzilla is usually installed on Linux and runs using the Apache HTTP Server , but Microsoft Internet Information Services or any web server that supports CGI can be used . Bugzilla 's installation process is command line driven and runs through a series of stages where system requirements and software capabilities are checked . While the potential exists in the code to turn Bugzilla into a technical support ticket system , task management tool , or project management tool , Bugzilla 's developers have chosen to focus on the task of designing a system to track software defects . Mandated design requirements include : By design , Bugzilla is programmed to return the string `` zarro boogs found '' instead of `` 0 bugs found '' when a search for bugs returns no results . `` Zarro Boogs '' is a facetious meta-statement about the nature of software debugging . Bug tracking systems like Bugzilla readily describe how many known bugs are outstanding . The response `` zarro boogs '' , is intended as a buggy statement itself ( a misspelling of `` zero bugs '' ) , implying that even when no bugs have been identified , software is still likely to contain bugs that have n't yet been identified .
Roasting is a cooking method that uses dry heat , whether an open flame , oven , or other heat source . Roasting usually causes caramelization or Maillard browning of the surface of the food , which is considered a flavor enhancement . Roasting uses more indirect , diffused heat ( as in an oven ) , and is suitable for slower cooking of meat in a larger , whole piece . Meats and most root and bulb vegetables can be roasted . Any piece of meat , especially red meat , that has been cooked in this fashion is called a roast . In addition , large uncooked cuts of meat are referred to as roasts . Roasting is a much slower method of cooking . A roast joint of meat can take one , two , even three hours to cook - the resulting meat is tender . Also , meats and vegetables prepared in this way are described as `` roasted '' , e.g. , roasted chicken or roasted squash . For roasting , the food may be placed on a rack , in a roasting pan or , to ensure even application of heat , may be rotated on a spit or rotisserie . During oven roasting , hot air circulates around the meat , cooking all sides evenly . There are several theories for roasting meats correctly : low-temperature cooking , high-temperature cooking , and a combination of both . Each method can be suitable under appropriate circumstances . In general , in either case , the meat is removed from heat before it has finished cooking and left to sit for a few minutes , while the inside cooks further from the residual heat content , a phenomenon known as carry over cooking . The objective in any case is to retain as much moisture as possible , while providing the texture and color . During roasting , meats and vegetables are frequently basted on the surface with butter , lard , or oil to reduce the loss of moisture by evaporation . In recent times , plastic oven bags have become popular for roasts . These cut cooking times and reduce the loss of moisture during roasting , but reduce flavor development from Maillard browning . They are particularly popular for turkeys . Until the late 19th century , roasting by dry heat in an oven was called baking . Roasting originally meant turning meat or a bird on a spit in front of a fire . It is one of the oldest forms of cooking known . Traditionally recognized roasting methods consist only of baking and cooking over or near an open fire . Grilling is normally not technically a roast , since a grill ( gridiron ) is used ( in English-speaking countries ) . Smoking differs from roasting because of the lower temperature and controlled smoke application . Most meat roasts are large cuts of meat . Many roasts are tied with string prior to roasting , often using the reef knot or , in the more traditional sense , the packer 's knot . Tying holds them together during roasting , keeping any stuffing inside , and keeps the roast in a round profile , which promotes even cooking . Prior to roasting in an oven , meat is generally `` browned '' by brief exposure to high temperature . This imparts a traditional flavor and color to the roast . Red meats such as beef , lamb , and venison , and certain game birds are often roasted to be `` pink '' or `` rare '' , meaning that the center of the roast is still red . Due to food safety concerns , this practice is not recommended with pork and poultry . Although there is a growing fashion in some restaurants to serve `` rose pork '' , temperature monitoring of the center of the roast is the only sure way to avoid foodborne disease . In Britain and Ireland , a roast of meat may be referred to as a joint , or a leg , if it is a leg . Roasting is a preferred method of cooking for most poultry , and certain cuts of beef , pork , or lamb . Some vegetables , such as potatoes , zucchini , pumpkin , turnips , parsnips , cauliflower , asparagus , squash , and peppers lend themselves to roasting as well . Roasted chestnuts are also a popular snack in winter .

Street Sharks was an American animated television series about crime-fighting half-man\/half-sharks . It was produced by DIC Entertainment and aired from 1994 to 1995 , originally as a part of the Amazin ' Adventures lineup . Later , in 1996 , the Street Sharks teamed up with the Dino Vengers and the show became `` Dino Vengers Featuring Street Sharks . Like a number of children 's cartoons , it was created to promote an existing Mattel toy line of the same name . The creators were David Siegel and Joe Galliani of Mr. Joe 's Really Big Productions . In the first episode , a university professor named Dr. Paradigm tested his gene-manipulation techniques on a marlin and a lobster . Dr. Bolton , a fellow professor , attempted to destroy Paradigm 's research , and was transformed into an inhuman monstrosity by the evil scientist before escaping . Paradigm later kidnapped Bolton 's four sons â '' John , Bobby , Coop , and Clint â '' to transform them into sharks . As soon as they transformed , the four brothers ate a hotdog stand and fled from the police by diving into a lake and burrowing their way into the city by eating the dirt . The brothers planned to capture Paradigm so that they could force him to return them to their human selves and expose Paradigm 's genetic experiments . In subsequent episodes , Paradigm began to convince the residents of Fission City that the Street Sharks ( as they became known ) were vicious , deadly killers who were mutated by their father , Dr. Bolton . The brothers teamed up every episode to stop Paradigm and his deadly Seaviates from transforming the citizens of Fission City into mutants with no free will . One of the characters ' favorite catchphrases was `` Jawsome '' , and their favorite food consists of Hamburgers , Hot Dogs and French fries ( although they 're capable of eating just about anything - even if it 's not food ) . The brothers have also expressed an obvious and very vocal dislike for pizza , a nod toward the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , who are well known to love pizza . An example of the Shark 's disdain for pizza can be seen in episode 2 , `` Sharkbite '' , when Lena 's offer to go get pizza was met with groans of disgust . This list of episodes may be incomplete or out-of-order . There was a feature film of the Street Sharks that was built by combining all of Season 1 's episodes 1-3 which were Sharkbait , Sharkbite , and Sharkstorm , and was titled , The Gene Slamming Begins . And , it was followed by two episode films , Shark Quest and Shark 'n' Roll . In 1996 , Archie Comics released a short-lived comic book series based on Street Sharks . They published a three-issue mini-series , and a regular comic series , which only lasted three issues . From 1994 to 1996 , Mattel released a line of Street Sharks action figures . Here is an incomplete list . Cookie Jar Entertainment currently has no plans to release the animated series on DVD .

Hank Ballard ( November 18 , 1927 â `` March 2 , 2003 ) , born John Henry Kendricks , was a rhythm and blues singer , the lead vocalist of Hank Ballard and The Midnighters and one of the first proto-rock 'n' roll artists to emerge in the early 1950s . He played an integral part in the development of rock music , releasing the hit singles `` Work With Me , Annie '' and answer songs `` Annie Had a Baby '' and `` Annie 's Aunt Fannie '' with his Midnighters . He later wrote and recorded `` The Twist '' and invented the dance , which was notably covered by Chubby Checker . Born John Henry Kendricks in Detroit , Michigan , Ballard along with his brother , Dove Ballard , after the death of their father , grew up and attended school in Bessemer , Alabama with his paternal aunt and her husband , where he began singing in church and later aspired to a career in music . Although Hank did sing in a church choir , his major vocal inspiration during his formative years , he confessed in an interview , was none other than the `` Singing Cowboy '' , Gene Autry , and one song in particular , his signature , `` Back In The Saddle Again '' , captured his fancy . Back in the 1940s , blues and R&B existed on race labels which were sold basically by word of mouth , but not yet broadcast via the radio ; so it really was n't such an unusual admission that he was influenced by C&W broadcasts . In 1951 , Ballard formed a doo-wop group . He was discovered by the band leader Johnny Otis , and was signed to sing with a group called The Royals , along with Henry Booth , Charles Sutton , Sonny Woods and Alonzo Tucker . The Royals had already signed to Federal Records ( a division of King Records ) , in Cincinnati when Ballard joined . The group then changed its name to The Midnighters to avoid confusion with The `` 5 '' Royales . Sutton was replaced by Lawson Smith , while Woods was replaced by Norman Thrasher . Tucker was replaced first by Arthur Porter and then by Cal Green . The group soon released `` Get It '' ( 1953 ) , an R&B song with sexually oriented lyrics , which many radio stations refused to play . In 1954 , Ballard wrote a song called `` Work with Me , Annie '' that was drawn from `` Get It '' . It became The Midnighters ' first major R&B hit , going to # 1 on the R&B charts and also selling well in mainstream markets , along with the answer songs `` Annie Had a Baby '' and `` Annie 's Aunt Fannie '' ; all were banned by the FCC from radio air play . Their third major hit was `` Sexy Ways '' , a song that cemented the band 's reputation as one of the most risquÃ groups of the time . They had four more R&B chart hits in 1954 â `` 55 . The Midnighters continued releasing singles and albums , and also changed their name to `` Hank Ballard and The Midnighters '' . Their label also changed from Federal to King , the parent label . They had no hits from 1956 â `` 58 . Then between 1959 and 1961 they had several more both on the R&B and Pop charts , including `` Let 's Go , Let 's Go , Let 's Go '' and the Grammy-nominated `` Finger Poppin ' Time '' , which hit # 6 and # 7 , respectively , on the Billboard Pop Top 10 . In 1959 Ballard 's song `` The Twist '' was released as the B-side of `` Teardrops on Your Letter '' . A year later Chubby Checker 's cover version of the song went to # 1 on the pop charts . It would return to the top of the charts again in 1962 â '' the only song in the rock 'n' roll era to do so . Though Chubby 's version brought about renewed interest in Ballard and The Midnighters for a time , the group dissolved in 1965 . Ballard tried to launch a solo career , working with James Brown on the You Ca n't Keep a Good Man Down album in 1969 and the `` From the Love Side '' single in 1972 , as well as making a guest appearance on Brown 's album Get on the Good Foot ( 1972 ) . Hank Ballard re-formed The Midnighters , and The Midnighters Band went on tour from the mid 1980s til 2002 . They released a live album on Charly , other albums , on After Hours , Pool Party , Greatest Hits by Rhino , Ace , Collectables and now Bear Family 1952 to 1962 . Ballard always thanked Chubby Checker and Dick Clark for popularizing his song `` The Twist '' . In 1990 Hank Ballard was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , though the original Midnighters , Henry Booth , Charles Sutton , Sonny Woods and Alonzo Tucker , were not . He wrote `` Look At Little Sister '' which was covered by Stevie Ray Vaughan . On March 2 , 2003 , he died of throat cancer in his Los Angeles home , aged 75 .

Tando Qaiser is a town in Hyderabad District , Pakistan . It is named after 18th century Chief Army Commander of Sindh Sardar Alludo Khan Nizamani 's Brother Sardar Kaiser Khan Nizamani . Tando Qaiser is older than the modern fort city of Hyderabad . Sindh was handed over to Kaiser Khan Nizamani by kings and he handed it over to talpurs . After that he could not stay here safe so he went to Dera Ghazi Khan , hence his grave is in Dera Ghazi Khan . As Kalhora kings moved the capital of Sindh from Khudaabad ( District Dadu ) to the newly built fort city of Hyderabad , they established army garrisons around the new capital . Kaiser Khan Nizamani and Alludo Khan Nizamani , an important commander in the army garrisoned in the then , Dhammach village , and the place , since then is known as Tando Qaiser . Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai was an ally of Kalhora Kings . Whenever he visited the capital , he used to make a stop at Tando Qaiser .

Cucurbitaceae is a plant family commonly known as melons , gourds or cucurbits and includes crops like cucumbers , squashes ( including pumpkins ) , luffas , melons ( including watermelons ) . The family is predominantly distributed around the tropics , where those with edible fruits were amongst the earliest cultivated plants in both the Old and New Worlds . Most of the plants in this family are annual vines but there are also woody lianas , thorny shrubs , and trees ( Dendrosicyos ) . Many species have large , yellow or white flowers . The stems are hairy and pentangular . Tendrils are present at 90 Â to the leaf petioles at nodes . Leaves are exstipulate alternate simple palmately lobed or palmately compound . The flowers are unisexual , with male and female flowers on different plants ( dioecious ) or on the same plant ( monoecious ) . The female flowers have inferior ovaries . The fruit is often a kind of modified berry called a pepo . There are about 125 extant genera in Cucurbitaceae , including 960 species . The following is the classification as given by Charles Jeffrey as of 1990 .

BotoÈ ani ( population : 119,132 ) is the capital city of BotoÅ ani County , in northern Moldavia , Romania . Today , it is best known as the birthplace of many celebrated Romanians , including Mihai Eminescu and Nicolae Iorga . The name of the city probably has its origin in the name of a boyar family called BotaÅ , whose name can be found in old records from the time of Prince Stephen the Great ( late 15th century ) as one of the most important families of Moldavia , records which trace it back to the 11th century . The oldest item ( to be dated precisely ) found in the area is an Armenian tombstone dated 1350 . The first mention of BotoÅ ani in writing is the Chronicles of Moldavia by Grigore Ureche , which records a devastating invasion of the Tatars on November 28 , 1493 . The city was initially a market town , being placed at the juncture of several commercial roads ; in the 16th century , it already had `` the biggest and the oldest fair of Moldavia '' . Large communities of Jewish and Armenian traders were present in this city starting with the 17th century . Jews constituted the majority of population throughout the 19th century . Mihai Eminescu , Romania 's national poet , was born in BotoÅ ani ( and spent his childhood in IpoteÅ ti ) , as was the famous Romanian historian Nicolae Iorga . Contemporary poet Maria Baciu also hails from BotoÅ ani . It is also the location of A.T. Laurian National College , one of Romania 's oldest ( founded 1859 ) and most prestigious pre-university educational institutions . According to the last census , from 2002 , there were 115,070 people living within the city of BotoÅ ani , making it the 20th largest city in Romania . The ethnic makeup is as follows : Boasting a rich cultural life , the town of BotoÅ ani has long produced major personalities in the sciences and culture . BotoÅ ani natives like Mihai Eminescu , Nicolae Iorga , Georgeta Damian and Octav Onicescu have become major figures in diverse disciplines , and many have distinct claims to relevance not just within Romania , but on a worldwide level . BotoÅ ani boasts many other constructions of special architectural value , among them : the Antipa House , from the end of the 19th century ; the Bolfosu House , from the beginning of the 19th century ; the Silion House , dating from 1900 ; and the City Hall , built at the end of the 18th century in an eclectic style with German influences . BotoÅ ani is served by the Suceava '' Å tefan cel Mare '' Airport ( SCV ) , located 30.5 k west of the city center . Football is represented in BotoÅ ani by the team FC BotoÅ ani .
Oceanic crust is the part of Earth 's lithosphere that surfaces in the ocean basins . Oceanic crust is primarily composed of mafic rocks , or sima , which is rich in iron and magnesium . It is thinner than continental crust , or sial , generally less than 10 kilometers thick , however it is denser , having a mean density of about 3.3 grams per cubic centimeter . Although a complete section of oceanic crust has not yet been drilled , geologists have several pieces of evidence that help them understand the ocean floor . Estimations of composition are based on analyses of ophiolites ( sections of oceanic crust that are preserved on the continents ) , comparisons of the seismic structure of the oceanic crust with laboratory determinations of seismic velocities in known rock types , and samples recovered from the ocean floor by submersibles , dredging ( especially from ridge crests and fracture zones ) and drilling . Oceanic crust is significantly simpler than continental crust and generally can be divided in three layers . The most voluminous volcanic rocks of the ocean floor are the mid-oceanic ridge basalts ( MORBs ) , which are derived from low-potassium tholeiitic magmas . These rocks have low concentrations of large ion lithophile elements ( LILE ) , light rare earth elements ( LREE ) , volatile elements and other highly incompatible elements ( Th , U , Nb , Ta and Pb ) . There can be found MORBs enriched with incompatible elements , but they are rare and associated with mid-ocean ridge hot spots such as surroundings of Galapagos Islands , the Azores and Iceland . Oceanic crust is continuously being created at mid-ocean ridges . At these ridges , magma rises into the upper mantle and crust , as the plates diverge . As it moves away from the ridge , the lithosphere becomes cooler and denser , and sediment gradually builds on top of it . The youngest oceanic lithosphere is at the oceanic ridges , and is progressively older away from the ridges . As the mantle rises it cools and melts , as the pressure decreases and it crosses the solidus . The amount of melt produced depends only on the temperature of the mantle as it rises . Hence most oceanic crust is the same thickness ( 7 Â 1 km ) . Very slow spreading ridges ( -1 half-rate ) produce thinner crust ( 4-5 km thick ) as the mantle has a chance to cool on upwelling and so it crosses the solidus and melts at a lower depth , thereby producing less melt and thinner crust . An example of this is the Gakkel Ridge under the Arctic Ocean . Thicker than average crust is found above plumes as the mantle is hotter and hence it crosses the solidus and melts at a lower depth , creating more melt and a thicker crust . An example of this is Iceland which has crust of thickness ~ 20 km . The oceanic lithosphere subducts at what are known as convergent boundaries . These boundaries can exist between oceanic lithosphere on one plate and oceanic lithosphere on another , or between oceanic lithosphere on one plate and continental lithosphere on another . In the second situation , the oceanic lithosphere always subducts because the continental lithosphere is less dense . The subduction process consumes older oceanic lithosphere , so oceanic crust is seldom more than 200 million years old . Plate tectonics is the study of these processes The overall process of repeated cycles of creation and destruction of oceanic crust is known as the Wilson cycle . The oceanic crust displays an interesting pattern of parallel magnetic lines , parallel to the ocean ridges , frozen in the basalt . In the 1950 â s , scientists mapped the magnetic field generated by rocks on the ocean floor . They noticed a symmetrical pattern of positive and negative magnetic lines as they moved along the ocean floor , and the line of symmetry was at the mid ocean ridge . The fact that the anomalies were symmetrical at the mid-ocean ridge was explained by the hypothesis that new rock was being formed by magma at the mid-ocean ridges , and the ocean floor was spreading out from this point . When the magma cooled to form rock , it aligned itself with the current position of the north magnetic pole of the Earth ( which has reversed many times in its past ) at the time of its cooling . New magma forced the older cooled magma away from the ridge . Approximately half of the new rock was formed on one side of the ridge and half on the other .
More critically , HotJava suffered from the performance limitations of Java virtual machine implementations of the day ( both in speed and in memory consumption ) and was consequently quite slow . A mobile browser , also called a microbrowser , minibrowser , or wireless internet browser ( WIB ) , is a web browser designed for use on a mobile device such as a mobile phone or PDA . Mobile browsers are optimized so as to display Web content most effectively for small screens on portable devices . Mobile browser software must be small and efficient to accommodate the low memory capacity and low-bandwidth of wireless handheld devices . Typically they were stripped-down web browsers , but as of 2006 some mobile browsers can handle more recent technologies like CSS 2.1 , JavaScript , and Ajax . Websites designed for access from these browsers are referred to as wireless portals . They may automatically create `` mobile '' versions of each page , for example this one . The mobile browser usually connects via a cellular network , or increasingly via Wireless LAN , using standard HTTP over TCP\/IP and displays web pages written in HTML , XHTML Mobile Profile ( WAP 2.0 ) , or WML ( which evolved from HDML ) . WML and HDML are stripped-down formats suitable for transmission across limited bandwidth , and wireless data connection called WAP . In Japan , DoCoMo defined the i-mode service based on i-mode HTML , which is an extension of Compact HTML ( C-HTML ) , a simple subset of HTML . WAP 2.0 specifies XHTML Mobile Profile plus WAP CSS , subsets of the W3C 's standard XHTML and CSS with minor mobile extensions . Newer microbrowsers are full-featured Web browsers capable of HTML , CSS , ECMAScript , as well as mobile technologies such as WML , i-mode HTML , or cHTML . The first mobile browser for a PDA was PocketWeb for the Apple Newton created at TecO in 1994 , followed by the first commercial product NetHopper released in August 1996 . The so-called microbrowser technologies such as WAP , NTTDocomo 's i-mode platform and Openwave 's HDML platform fueled the first wave of interest in wireless data services . The first deployment of a microbrowser on a mobile phone was probably in 1997 when Unwired Planet ( later to become Openwave ) put their `` UP . Browser '' on AT&T handsets to give users access to HDML content . A British company , STNC Ltd. , developed a microbrowser ( HitchHiker ) in 1997 that was intended to present the entire device UI . The demonstration platform for this microbrowser ( Webwalker ) had 1 MIPS total processing power . This was a single core platform , running the GSM stack on the same processor as the application stack . In 1999 STNC was acquired by Microsoft and HitchHiker became Microsoft Mobile Explorer 2.0 , not related to the primitive Microsoft Mobile Explorer 1.0 . HitchHiker is believed to be the first microbrowser with a unified rendering model , handling HTML and WAP along with ECMAScript , WMLScript , POP3 and IMAP mail in a single client . Although it was not used , it was possible to combine HTML and WAP in the same pages although this would render the pages invalid for any other device . Mobile Explorer 2.0 was available on the Benefon Q , Sony CMD-Z5 , CMD-J5 , CMD-MZ5 , CMD-J6 , CMD-Z7 , CMD-J7 and CMD-J70 . With the addition of a messaging kernel and a driver model , this was powerful enough to be the operating system for certain embedded devices . One such device was the Amstrad e-m JJ iler and e-m NN iler 2 . This code formed the basis for MME3 . Released in 2001 , Mobile Explorer 3.0 added iMode compatibility ( cHTML ) plus numerous proprietary schemes . By imaginatively combining these proprietary schemes with WAP protocols , MME3 .0 implemented OTA database synchronisation , push email , push information clients ( not unlike a ` Today Screen ' ) and PIM functionality . The canceled Sony Ericsson CMD-Z700 was to feature heavy integration with MME3 .0 . Although Mobile Explorer was ahead of its time in the mobile phone space , development was stopped in 2002 . A freeware ( although later shareware ) browser for the PalmOS was Palmscape , written in 1998 by Kazuho Oku in Japan , who went on to found Ilinx . Still in limited use as late as 2003 . Also in 2002 , Palm , Inc. offered Web Pro on Tungsten PDAs based upon a Novarra browser . Opera Software pioneered with its Small Screen Rendering ( SSR ) and Medium Screen Rendering ( MSR ) technology . The Opera web browser is able to reformat regular web pages for optimal fit on small screens and medium-sized ( PDA ) screens . It was also the first widely available mobile browser to support Ajax and the first mobile browser to pass ACID2 test . Distinct from a mobile browser is a web-based emulator , which uses a `` Virtual Handset '' to display WAP pages on a computer screen , implemented either in Java or as an HTML transcoder . The following are some of the more popular mobile browsers . Some mobile browsers are really miniaturized Web browsers , so some mobile browser companies also provide browsers for desktop and laptop computers . Mobile transcoders reformat and compress web content for mobile devices and must be used in conjunction with built-in or user-installed microbrowsers .

L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue ( colloquially L'Isle-sur-Sorgue ; or ) is a town and commune on the Sorgue river southeastern France . Politically , the commune is in the arrondissement of Avignon within the dÃ partement of Vaucluse and the region of Provence-Alpes-C Ã te d'Azur . The town is famous for its many antique shops and hosts antique markets most Sundays . L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue is a small town with many waterside cafÃ s and restaurants , all within walking distance of each other . Keith Floyd , the British TV chef and bon viveur established a restaurant there during a lengthy sojourn in France . L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue is twinned with the towns of Penicuik in Scotland , and Anagni in Italy . Originally known as `` Insula '' , the town officially adopted the name of `` L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue '' on 18 August 1890 , taking the latter part of its name from the river Sorgue , to which it owed much . As early as the 12th century , the river served defensively as a moat around ramparts which surrounded the town until 1795 . The river also served as a source of food and industry : fishing and artisan mills for oil , wheat , silk , paper , woolenry , rugs and dyeing . A busy commerce developed until there were two annual fairs and two weekly markets . The current Thursday open-air market originated on 9 November 1596 .
Computer engineering , also called computer systems engineering , is a discipline that integrates several fields of electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer systems . Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering , software design , and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering . Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing , from the design of individual microprocessors , personal computers , and supercomputers , to circuit design . This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work , but also how they integrate into the larger picture . Usual tasks involving computer engineers include writing software and firmware for embedded microcontrollers , designing VLSI chips , designing analog sensors , designing mixed signal circuit boards , and designing operating systems . Computer engineers are also suited for robotics research , which relies heavily on using digital systems to control and monitor electrical systems like motors , communications , and sensors . The first accredited computer engineering degree program in the United States was established at Case Western Reserve University in 1971 . As of October 2004 , there were 170 ABET-accredited computer engineering programs in the US . Due to increasing job requirements for engineers , who can concurrently design hardware , software , firmware , and manage all forms of computer systems used in industry , some tertiary institutions around the world offer a bachelor 's degree generally called computer engineering . Both computer engineering and electronic engineering programs include analog and digital circuit design in their curricula . As with most engineering disciplines , having a sound knowledge of mathematics and sciences is necessary for computer engineers . In many institutions , computer engineering students are allowed to choose areas of in-depth study in their junior and senior year , because the full breadth of knowledge used in the design and application of computers is beyond the scope of an undergraduate degree .
Sherwood Forest is a Royal Forest in Nottinghamshire , England , that is famous through its historical association with the legend of Robin Hood . Continuously forested since the end of the Ice Age , Sherwood is today reduced to a 423 hectare ( 1.63 square-mile ) remnant surrounding the village of Edwinstowe , the site of Thoresby Hall . The wooded forest of today is a remnant of a much larger royal hunting forest , named as the `` shire wood '' of Nottinghamshire , which in fact extended into several neighbouring counties ( shires ) , bordered on the west along the River Erewash and the Forest of East Derbyshire . The Forestry Commission manages most of the forest and provides walks and trails and a host of other activities . Part of the forest was opened as a country park to the public in 1969 by Nottinghamshire County Council , which manages a small part of the forest under lease from the Thoresby Estate . In 2002 , a portion of Sherwood Forest was designated a National Nature Reserve by English Nature . In 2007 , Natural England officially incorporated the Budby South Forest , Nottinghamshire 's largest area of dry lowland heath , into the Nature Reserve , nearly doubling its size from 220 t. Some portions of the forest still retain many very old oaks , especially in the portion known as the Dukeries , south of the town of Worksop , which was so called because it used to contain five ducal residences in proximity to one another . The River Idle , a tributary of the Trent , is formed in Sherwood Forest from the confluence of several minor streams . Sherwood attracts 500,000 tourists annually , including many from around the world . Visitor numbers have increased significantly since the launch of the BBC 's Robin Hood television series in 2006 . The park hosts the annual Robin Hood Festival for a week each summer . This event recreates a medieval atmosphere and features the major characters from the Robin Hood legend . The week 's entertainment includes jousters and strolling players , dressed in medieval attire , in addition to a medieval encampment complete with jesters , musicians , rat-catchers , alchemists and fire eaters . Throughout the year , visitors are also attracted to the Sherwood Forest Art and Craft Centre , which is situated in the former Coach House and Stables of Edwinstowe Hall in the heart of the Forest . The center contains art studios and a cafe , and hosts special events , including craft demonstrations and exhibitions . Sherwood Forest is home to the famous Major Oak , which , according to local folklore , was Robin Hood 's principal hideout . The oak tree is between 800 and 1,000 years old and , since the Victorian era , its massive limbs have been partially supported by an elaborate system of scaffolding . In February 1998 , a local company took cuttings from the Major Oak and began cultivating clones of the famous tree with the intention of sending saplings to be planted in major cities around the world . The Major Oak was featured on the 2005 BBC TV program Seven Natural Wonders as one of the natural wonders of the Midlands . Thynghowe , an important Danelaw meeting place where people came to resolve disputes and settle issues , was lost to history until its rediscovery in 2005-06 by local history enthusiasts amidst the old oaks of an area known as the Birklands . Experts believe it may also yield clues as to the boundary of the ancient Anglo Saxon kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria . English Heritage have recently inspected the site , and have confirmed it was known as `` Thynghowe '' in 1334 and 1609 . In early 2006 it was announced that major plans to transform the Sherwood Forest Visitor Centre had been drawn up and are now complete . Nottinghamshire County Council led a partnership which put in an unsuccessful bid for Â # 50 million from the Big Lottery Fund 's Living Landmarks competition . The project was selected by Big Lottery Fund assessors as one of four finalists .
Yoshinobu Ishii ( born 13 March 1939 in Fukuyama , Hiroshima , Japan ) is a former Japanese football player . Ishii was manager of the Japan national football team from 1986 to 1987 .

Harold Harefoot ( or Harold I ) ( c. 1015 â `` 17 March 1040 ) was King of England from 1037 to 1040 . His cognomen `` Harefoot '' referred to his speed , and the skill of his huntsmanship . He was the son of Cnut the Great , king of England , Denmark , and Norway by Ã lfgifu of Northampton . Though there was some scepticism that he was really Cnut 's son , this was probably just propaganda by those who opposed his kingship . Upon Cnut 's death ( 12 November 1035 ) , Harold 's younger half-brother Harthacnut , the son of Cnut and his queen Emma of Normandy , was legitimate heir to the thrones of both the Danes and the English . Harthacnut , however , was unable to travel to his coronation in England because his Danish kingdom was under threat of invasion by King Magnus I of Norway and King Anund Jacob of Sweden . England 's magnates favored the idea of installing Harold Harefoot temporarily as regent , due to the difficulty of Harthacnut 's absence , and despite the opposition of Godwin , the Earl of Wessex , and the Queen , he eventually wore the crown . Harold survived an attempt to unseat him jointly led by Ã lfred Ã theling and Edward the Confessor , Emma 's sons by the long-dead Ã thelred the Unready , in 1036 . In 1037 , Emma of Normandy fled to Bruges , in Flanders , and Harold `` was everywhere chosen as king '' . Harold himself is somewhat obscure ; the historian Frank Stenton considered it probable that his mother Ã lfgifu was `` the real ruler of England '' for part or all of his reign . With the north at least on Harold 's side , in adherence to the terms of a deal , which Godwin was part of , Emma was settled in Winchester , with Harthacnut 's huscarls . Harold soon `` sent and had taken from her all the best treasures '' of Cnut the Great , and the Kingdom of England was practically his . According to the Encomium Emmae , though , the Archbishop of Canterbury refused to crown Harold Harefoot . There is evidence that Ã lfgifu of Northampton was attempting to secure her son 's position through bribes to the nobles . In 1036 , Ã lfred Ã theling , Emma 's son by the long dead Ã thelred , returned to the kingdom from exile in Normandy with his brother Edward the Confessor , with some show of arms . With his bodyguard , according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle he intended to visit his mother , Emma , in Winchester , but he may have made this journey for reasons other than a family reunion . As the `` murmur was very much in favor of Harold '' , on the direction of Godwin ( now apparently on the side of Harold Harefoot ) , Ã lfred was captured and blinded by men loyal to Harefoot . He died soon after due to the severity of the wounds , his bodyguard similarly treated . Harold died at Oxford on 17 March 1040 , just as Harthacnut was preparing an invasion force of Danes , and was buried at Westminster Abbey . His body was subsequently exhumed , beheaded , and thrown into a fen bordering the Thames when Harthacnut assumed the throne in June 1040 . His supporters later rescued the body , to be buried in a church in the City of Westminster which was fittingly named St. Clement Danes . Harold apparently had a son , Ã lfwine , who became a monk on the continent when he was older . Ã lfgifu of Northampton disappears with no trace after 1040 . According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle , Harold Harefoot ruled for 4 years and 16 weeks , by which calculation he would have begun ruling two weeks after the death of Cnut .
Igor CvitanoviÄ ( born 1 November 1970 in Osijek ) is a retired Croatian football striker . He is currently the all-time top goalscorer of the Croatian First League with a total of 126 goals , and also scored 122 domestic league goals for Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb , 117 of which were in the Croatian First League . He also played for the Croatian national team . CvitanoviÄ started his professional career at Dinamo Zagreb in 1989 , appearing in 10 Yugoslav First League matches and scoring five goals for the club in the league during his first professional season . He was subsequently loaned to Varteks VaraÅ 3\/4 din during the inaugural season of the Croatian First League in the spring of 1992 , making 21 appearances and scoring nine goals in the league before returning to Dinamo Zagreb the following summer . Between 1992 and 1997 , CvitanoviÄ spent five and a half seasons playing for Dinamo Zagreb and became the top goalscorer of the Croatian First League in two consecutive seasons , scoring 19 goals in 1995-96 and 20 goals in 1996-97 . In 1995 , he had agreed terms with Middlesbrough in the Premier League , but the Â # 1million transfer fell through on 2 December 1995 after the Department of Employment refuse to issue him with a work permit . He also scored 27 league goals in the 1993-94 season , but was at the time overtaken in the goalscoring charts by his then teammate Goran VlaoviÄ , who scored 29 league goals that season . CvitanoviÄ also scored nine goals in 14 league matches in the autumn of 1997 , before moving abroad to Spanish side Real Sociedad at the beginning of the year 1998 . He scored a total of 104 goals in domestic league competitions for Dinamo Zagreb before leaving the club , becoming their most successful goalscorer of all time . He failed to find much success with the Spanish side , scoring only three goals in 29 La Liga appearances before returning to Dinamo Zagreb in 1999 . In 2002 , he left Dinamo Zagreb to spend a season with Japanese side Shimizu S-Pulse and then returned to Croatia to spend one more season with Osijek in 2003-04 , before retiring from playing . CvitanoviÄ made his international debut for the Croatian national team on 22 October 1992 in a friendly match against Mexico in Zagreb . On 17 August 1994 , he netted a brace for Croatia in a friendly match against Israel in Tel Aviv to score his first international goals . CvitanoviÄ was also part of the Croatian squad at the UEFA Euro 1996 finals in England , where he did not play any matches . In the qualifying stages for the tournament , he only made one appearance as a stoppage-time substitute . He went on to make six appearances in Croatia 's qualifying campaign for the 1998 FIFA World Cup , but was dismissed from the team 's training camp a few weeks before the beginning of the finals due to differences of opinion between him and coach Miroslav BlaÅ 3\/4 eviÄ . He briefly returned to the team in the spring of 1999 , making further six appearances in friendlies , with his last international match being against Korea Republic on 19 June 1999 at the Korea Cup in Seoul .

`` Blitzkrieg Bop '' is a song by the American punk rock band Ramones . It was released as the band 's debut single in April of 1976 in the United States . It appeared as the lead track on the band 's debut album , Ramones , also released that month . The song , whose composition was credited to the band as a whole , was written by bassist Dee Dee Ramone ( lyrics ) and drummer Tommy Ramone ( music and lyrics ) . Based on a simple three-chord pattern , `` Blitzkrieg Bop '' opens with the chant `` Hey ! Ho ! Let 's go ! '' . The song is popular at sporting events where `` Hey ! Ho ! Let 's go ! '' is sometimes shouted as a rallying cry . `` Blitzkrieg Bop '' is number 92 on the Rolling Stone list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time . In March 2005 , Q magazine placed it at number 31 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks , and in 2008 Rolling Stone placed it number 18 on top 100 of Best Guitar Songs of All Time . In 2009 it was named the 25th greatest hard rock song of all time by VH1 . `` Blitzkrieg Bop '' was named after the German World War II tactic blitzkrieg , which literally means `` lightning war '' . The song was mainly written by drummer Tommy Ramone , while bassist Dee Dee Ramone came up with the title ( the song was originally called `` Animal Hop '' ) . Dee Dee also changed one line : The original third verse had the line `` shouting in the back now '' , but Dee Dee changed it to `` shoot 'em in the back now '' . The precise meaning and subject matter of the song are , unlike many of The Ramones ' other early compositions , somewhat vague and obscure . It may be a reference to attacking the exposed flank of tanks during a blitzkrieg operation , while some fans contend , based on lines such as `` Shoot 'em in the back now '' , that the song tells of gang violence , which would seem to be more in line with the bands ' other songs of that era . But it is more likely that the song is simply about having a good time at a concert , perhaps an ode to early punk fans . The time signature for this song is 4\/4 . The first chordal pattern in the intro goes as follows A , D , E. Until the lyrical motif of `` Hey ! Ho ! Let 's go ! '' occurs . The chorus contains a slight variation of the first chord progression ( introduced in the intro ) chord pattern with a B three bars before the end of the chorus ( D , A , D , A , D , B , D , E ) . The majority of the chords played within this song would be `` power chords '' or `` bare fifth '' chords . This means they lack a third within the chord , this is what determines a chord major or minor ( either the 3rd being flat , sharp or natural ) . Power chords are typical of the punk and rock guitar playing . `` Bare fifth 's '' are also a characterisic of modal music .
The Pink Fairy Armadillo ( Chlamyphorus truncatus ) or Pichiciego is the smallest species of armadillo ( mammals of the family Dasypodidae , mostly known for having a bony armor shell ) . It is found in central Argentina where it inhabits dry grasslands and sandy plains with thorn bushes and cacti . The Pink Fairy Armadillo is approximately 90 â `` 115 mm ( 3.5-4 .5 inches ) long excluding the tail , and is pale rose or pink in color . It has the ability to bury itself completely in a matter of seconds if frightened . It is a nocturnal animal . It burrows small holes near ant colonies in dry dirt , and feeds mainly on ants and ant larvae near its burrow . Occasionally it feeds on worms , snails , insects and larvae , or various plant and root material . The Pink Fairy Armadillo spends much of its time under the ground as it is a `` sand swimmer '' similar to the Golden Mole or the Marsupial Mole . They use large front claws to agitate the sand , allowing them to almost swim through the ground like it is water . It is torpedo-shaped and has a shielded head to prevent abrasion from the sand . In 1996 the species was classed as endangered by the IUCN , then downgraded to `` near threatened '' in 2006 , and in 2008 changed to `` data deficient '' , despite concern over habitat destruction , particularly due to cattle farming . This armadillo is found in several protected areas , including the LihuÃ Calel National Park . Both national and provincial legislation is in place specifically protecting the species .

The Taito Corporation is a Japanese publisher of video game software and arcade hardware wholly owned by publisher Square Enix . Taito has their headquarters in the Shinjuku Bunka Quint Building in Yoyogi , Shibuya , Tokyo , sharing the facility with its parent company . Taito imports and distributes American coin-op video games in Japan , as well as their own games all around the world . Taito also owns several game centers in Japan known as Taito Stations . Taito Corporation currently has a subsidiary in Beijing , China . In the past , the company had operated divisions in North America , Brazil , South Korea and Italy . The company was founded in 1953 by a Russian businessman named Michael Kogan as Taito Trading Company . Taito started out importing and distributing vending machines . Later , they began leasing jukeboxes and they eventually started to manufacture their own . Taito introduced their first video arcade game in 1973 . It was also this year that they changed their name from Taito Trading Company to Taito Corporation . In 1978 Toshihiro Nishikado , a designer at Taito , created Space Invaders which became the company 's most popular title ever and one of the most memorable games in arcade history . The game was published in the US by Midway . Space Invaders was inspired by an earlier 1972 electro-mechanical game by Taito called Space Monsters . Due to the huge success of Space Invaders , Taito opened in 1979 an American division called Taito America Corporation in order to release games in North America . Taito America was based in Wheeling , Illinois and was handling the arcade sector of the company in North America . While the majority of the games Taito America published were games developed by the Japanese parent company , they did also publish games that they licensed from third-party companies , as well as games that were developed in the U.S. for Taito . Besides Taito America , Taito had another division in North America called Taito Software Inc that was in charge of the non-arcade sector of the company . Based in North Vancouver , British Columbia and established in 1988 , Taito Software released Taito games exclusively for home computers and consoles . Prior to Taito Software , the consumer side was also handled by Taito America . Like Taito America , Taito Software 's catalog was mainly games developed by the Japanese parent company and occasionally games licensed from other companies . 1995 marked the last year that North America saw the Taito label on new games as Taito America and Taito Software closed down their offices at the same time . Video games developed by Taito are still available in North America to this day , but they now bear the name of other publishers . Taito has had a big influence on the course of videogame history , developing some very innovative games . Space Invaders is probably the most notable , but games such as Qix , Bubble Bobble , Jungle Hunt , Elevator Action , Puzznic , Operation Wolf and Puzzle Bobble also introduced unique and innovative gameplay ideas . Taito also had a license from Hanna-Barbera to do games based on The Flintstones and The Jetsons . In 1992 , Taito announced a CD-ROM-based console system named WOWOW , that would have allowed people to play near-exact ports of Taito 's arcades ( similar to the Neo Geo ) , as well as download games from a satellite transmission ( as the Satellaview would do later ) . It was named after the Japanese television station WOWOW and would have utilized its stations to download games . The WOWOW was never released . When Taito was owned by Kyocera , their headquarters were in HirakawachÅ , Chiyoda . On August 22 , 2005 , it was announced that gaming giant Square Enix would purchase 247,900 Taito shares worth Â 45.16 billion ( US$ 409.1 million ) , to make Taito Corporation a subsidiary of Square Enix . The purpose of the takeover by Square Enix was to both increase Taito 's profit margin exponentially as well as begin their company 's expansion into new forms of gaming ( most notably , the arcade scene ) , and various other entertainment venues . The takeover bid from Square Enix was accepted by previous majority stockholder Kyocera , making Taito an official Square Enix subsidiary . On September 22 , 2005 , Square Enix announced successfully acquiring 93.7 % of all shares of Taito , effectively owning the entire company . By September 28 , 2005 , Taito became a subsidiary wholly owned by Square Enix . The present Taito Corporation was formed on March 31 , 2006 by merging Taito into SQEX Corporation ( formerly The Game Designers Studio ) . Square Enix officially announced on July 28 , 2008 that they would liquidate two subsidiaries of Taito , Taito Art Corporation and Taito Tech Co. , Ltd. on the grounds that both had fulfilled their business purpose . The process officially ended in October 2008 .

Nickel nitrate is the chemical compound Ni ( NO3 ) 2 or any hydrate thereof . The anhydrous form is not commonly encountered , thus `` nickel nitrate '' usually refers to nickel ( II ) nitrate hexahydrate . The formula for this species is written in two ways . Ni ( NO3 ) 2.6 H2O and , more descriptively ( Ni ( H2O ) 6 ) ( NO3 ) 2 . The latter formula indicates that the nickel ( II ) center is surrounded by six water molecules in this hydrated salt . The nitrate anions are not bonded to nickel . ( Ni ( H2O ) 6 ) ( NO3 ) 2 is highly soluble in water , giving emerald green solutions . It is a useful precursor to other nickel ( II ) derivatives where the water ligands would be replaced . Like other nitrates , nickel nitrate is oxidizing , so that caution should be exercised when it contacts with reducing materials such as organic substances . It is also irritating to the eyes , skin and , upon inhalation of the dust , respiratory tract . It may cause skin allergy . Nickel nitrate is a carcinogen , along with most other nickel compounds . The nickel ion is also toxic to aquatic organisms .

Announced at the Mobile World Congress on February 16 , 2009 , the KM900 is the first phone to feature LGâ s new 3D S-Class user interface . The S-Class is a capacitive touch-based 3D UI that lays out menus as if they were on a film reel , enabling you to drag your finger across the reels to scroll through the available options . It is based around a cube layout that provides four home screens that can be customised with different shortcuts . The UI reacts to the orientation of the Arena , switching between portrait and landscape modes . Arena is a metal-cased device , available in silver , black Titanium & pink color schemes . It has a 3-inch WVGA tempered glass multi-touch capable touchscreen with a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels . The 5-Megapixel CMOS Schneider Kreuznach camera with LED flash can record QVGA video at up to 120 frames per second , DVD resolution ( 720x480 ) at 30 frames per second or encode H. 264 at 15 frames per second .

In terms of software , Google Mobile Service which includes Google Search , Google Maps , Gmail , YouTube , and Google Blogs is embedded . However , Orange UK have removed these features from the phone . Although the device is compatible with both Wi-Fi and YouTube , streaming YouTube videos using a wireless network is not possible with most firmware versions , including the newest ones . Some alternative ( and older ) firmware versions , like V0O_02 , implement the solution for this problem , but were not developed by LG and result on device 's performance decrease . In September 2009 the V10P_00 version was released and updated the Google Maps version to 2.3.2 , as well as some GPS functions , making possible for the handset to find your location in under 5 seconds . In older firmware version this would normally take more than 1 minute . The most user stable and friendly firmware at present is the V10P_00 and V10F_00 which are both open and not locked to any firmware version , it is now possible to unlock the handset to use on any network . Owners of the handset have modded and edited the V10P_00 to allow a windows theme version of the firmware which is impressive . However , this phone has proven to be very unreliable with a constant tendency to freeze when you are multi-tasking or try to read a message too quickly after reception .

The Times of India ( TOI ) is an English-language daily newspaper in India . It has the largest circulation among all English-language newspapers in the world , across all formats ( broadsheet , tabloid , compact , Berliner and online ) . It is owned and managed by Bennett , Coleman & Co. . Ltd. which is owned by the Sahu Jain family . In the year 2008 , the newspaper reported that ( with a circulation of over 3.14 million ) it was certified by the Audit Bureau of Circulations ( India ) as the world 's largest selling English-language daily newspaper , placing as the 8th largest selling newspaper in any language in the world . According to the Indian Readership Survey ( IRS ) 2010 , the Times of India is the most widely read English newspaper in India with a readership of 70.35 lakhs ( 7.035 million ) . This ranks the Times of India as the top English newspaper in India by readership . According to ComScore , indiatimes ( and not TOI online ) is the world 's most-visited newspaper website with 159 million page views in May 2009 , ahead of the New York Times , The Sun , Washington Post , Daily Mail and USA Today websites ( citation needed ) . The Times Of India was founded on November 3 , 1838 as ` The Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce ' In Mumbai , during the British Raj . Published every Saturday and Wednesday , The Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce was launched as a semi-weekly edition . It contained news from Britain and the world , as well as the Subcontinent . The daily editions of the paper were started from 1850 and in 1861 , the Bombay Times was renamed The Times of India . In the 19th century this newspaper company employed more than 800 people and had a sizable circulation in India and Europe . It was after India 's Independence that the ownership of the paper passed on to the then famous industrial family of Dalmiyas and later it was taken over by Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain of the Sahu Jain group from Bijnore , UP . India 's press in the 1840s was a motley collection of small-circulation daily or weekly sheets printed on rickety presses . Few extended beyond their small communities and seldom tried to unite the many castes , tribes , and regional subcultures of India . The Anglo-Indian papers promoted purely British interests . Robert Knight ( 1825 â `` 1892 ) was the principal founder and the first editor of the Times . The son of a London bank clerk from the lower-middle-class , Knight proved a skilled writer and passionate reformer . Knight helped create a vibrant national newspaper industry in British India . When the Sepoy Mutiny erupted , Knight was acting editor of the Bombay Times and Standard . He broke with the rest of the English language press ( which focused on Indian savagery and treachery ) and instead blamed the violence on the lack of discipline and poor leadership in the army . That angered the Anglo community , but attracted the Times 's Indian shareholders , who made him the permanent editor . Knight blasted the mismanagement and greed of the Raj , attacking annexation policies that appropriated native lands and arbitrarily imposed taxes on previously exempt land titles , ridiculing income taxes , and exposing school systems that disregarded Indian customs and needs . Knight led the paper to national prominence . In 1860 , he bought out the Indian shareholders and merged with the rival Bombay Standard , and started India 's first news agency . It wired Times dispatches to papers across the country and became the Indian agent for Reuters news service . In 1861 , he changed the name from the Bombay Times and Standard to the Times of India . Knight fought for a press free of prior restraint or intimidation , frequently resisting the attempts by governments , business interests , and cultural spokesmen . The Times of India is published by the media group Bennett , Coleman & Co. . Ltd. . This company , along with its other group companies , known as The Times Group , also publishes The Economic Times , Mumbai Mirror , Pune Mirror , Bangalore Mirror , Ahmedabad Mirror , the Navbharat Times ( a Hindi-language daily broadsheet ) , the Maharashtra Times ( a Marathi-language daily broadsheet ) . In late 2006 , Times Group acquired Vijayanand Printers Limited ( VPL ) . VPL used to publish two Kannada newspapers Vijay Karnataka and Usha Kiran and an English daily Vijay Times . Vijay Karnataka was the leader in the Kannada newspaper segment then . In January 2007 , the Kannada edition was launched in Bangalore and in April 2008 the Chennai edition was launched . Their main rivals in India are The Hindu and Hindustan Times , which hold second and third position by circulation .

Nu metal ( also known as nÃ 1\/4 - metal , switch-metal , aggro-metal or neo-metal ) is a subgenre of heavy metal . It is a fusion genre which combines elements of heavy metal with other genres , including grunge and rapping . The genre gained mainstream success in the late 1990s and early 2000s . Bands associated with nu metal derive influence from a variety of diverse styles , including electronica\/electronic music , funk , glam rock , gothic rock , grunge , hardcore punk , hip hop , industrial rock , jazz , post punk and synthpop . Also , nu metal derives influence from multiple subgenres of heavy metal including rap metal , funk metal , alternative metal and thrash metal . Nu metal music is mostly syncopated and based on riffs . Mid-song breakdowns and virtuosity contrasts it with other metal subgenres . Another way in which nu metal is contrasted with other metal subgenres is its emphasis on rhythm , tending to more elements of groove metal . Similarities with other heavy metal subgenres include its use of common time , distorted guitars , power chords and note structures primarily revolving around Dorian , Aeolian or Phrygian modes . Some nu metal bands use seven-string guitars over traditional six-string guitars . 7-string guitars , which are sometimes downtuned to increase heaviness , resulted in bass guitarists using five-string and six-string instruments . DJs are also sometimes used for additional rhythmic instrumentation ( such as music sampling , scratching and electronic backgrounds ) . The vocals of many bands may range from melodic singing to rapping to screaming to death growling or in some cases have all of these styles in a single song but it can range from song to song . The lyrics of many popular mainstream nu metal bands focused on pain and personal alienation rather than the themes of other metal subgenres . In general many cases this is a trait from grunge bands and is sometimes seen as a disadvantage of the genre ; Q Magazine argues that many of '' ( its ) leading lights ( focused on ) abandonment issues they should have left behind on their first day of big school '' which was focused in the mainstream music aspect of the genre . Nu metal fashion can include baggy shorts , loud guitars and tattoos and anything else is a bonus . In Nu-metal : The Next Generation of Rock & Punk , Joel McIver cites the bands Faith No More , Tool , Red Hot Chili Peppers , Beastie Boys , Nirvana and Jane 's Addiction as setting up various musical characteristics which are prominent in the genre . In Popular music genres : an introduction , Stuart Borthwick and Ron Moy identify Rage Against the Machine as an influence on nu metal . Many of the first nu metal bands came from California . Its origins are often atributed to the work of producer Ross Robinson , sometimes called `` The Godfather of Nu Metal '' , who worked with acts such as Korn , Limp Bizkit , producing their first albums and helping create the sound that defined them . Korn pioneered the nu metal sound and released their first self-titled album in 1994 , but they did not gain mainstream popularity until years later . The most `` pure '' form of nu-metal is considered to be the one contained in their second studio album , Life is Peachy . However , Korn has repeatedly stated that they do not agree with the label `` nu-metal '' , saying they considered the term `` dumb '' . Nu metal gained mainstream success through MTV and Ozzy Osbourne 's 1995 introduction of Ozzfest , which led the media to talk of a resurgence of heavy metal . Also , the 30th anniversary of Woodstock ( Woodstock 99 ) featured nu metal bands , notably Korn and Limp Bizkit . Established artists such as Sepultura , Slayer , Vanilla Ice , and Machine Head released albums which critics felt drew from the style . In Sound of the Beast : The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal , Ian Christie wrote that the genre demonstrated that `` pancultural metal could pay off . '' However , some fans of traditional heavy metal did not fully embrace the style . In 2001 , nu metal reached its commercial peak with albums like Staind 's Break the Cycle , P.O. D 's Satellite , Slipknot 's Iowa and Linkin Park 's Hybrid Theory . New bands also emerged like Disturbed , post-grunge\/hard rock band Godsmack and Papa Roach , whose major label dÃ but Infest became a platinum hit . By 2002 there were signs that nu metal 's mainstream popularity was weakening . Several factors contributed to this , including over saturation of the market , and a stigma associated with the genre . Korn 's long awaited fifth album Untouchables , and Papa Roach 's second album Lovehatetragedy , did not sell as well as their previous releases , while nu metal bands were played more infrequently on rock radio stations and MTV began focusing on pop punk and emo . Since then , many bands have changed to a more conventional hard rock or heavy metal music sound .

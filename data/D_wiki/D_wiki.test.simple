a gv star , or yellow dwarf , is a main-sequence star . it is of spectral type g and luminosity class v on the hertzsprung-russell diagram . the term `` yellow dwarf '' is a misnomer , because g-type stars actually range in color from white , for more luminous types like the sun , to only very slightly yellow for the less massive and luminous g-type main-sequence stars . see spectral classification for a chart of star color by light type.gv stars are small ( about 0.8 to 1.0 solar masses ) and have a surface temperature of between 5,300 and 6,000 k. like other main-sequence stars , a gv star turns hydrogen to helium in its core by means of nuclear fusion.our sun is the most commonly known ( and most easily seen ) example of a gv star . each second , it combines around 600 million tons of hydrogen to helium , changing about 4 million tons of matter to energy . other gv stars include alpha centauri a , tau ceti , and 51 pegasi.our own sun looks yellow through the earth 's atmosphere due to rayleigh scattering . without that , it would look white . even though the name `` dwarf '' is used to compare yellow main sequence stars from giant stars , yellow dwarfs like the sun are 90 % brighter than all of the stars in the milky way ( which are largely orange dwarfs , red dwarfs , and white dwarfs ) .a gv star fuses hydrogen nuclei together and release energy for around 10 billion years . after the hydrogen is used up , the star will grow to many times its earlier size and become a red giant like aldebaran . eventually the red giant will lose its outer layers of gas , which will become a planetary nebula , while the inside of the star ( also known as the core ) will cool and shrink into a small , very dense white dwarf .

with one number `` a '' and another smaller number `` b '' , the ratio of the two numbers is found by dividing them . their ratio is `` a '' / '' b '' . another ratio is found by adding the two numbers together and dividing this by the larger number `` a '' . the new ratio is ( `` a '' + '' b '' ) / '' a '' . if these two ratios are equal to the same number , then that number is called the golden ratio . the greek letter formula_1 ( phi ) is usually used as the name for the golden ratio.for example , if `` b '' = 1 and `` a '' / '' b '' = formula_1 , then `` a '' = formula_1 . the second ratio ( `` a '' + '' b '' ) / '' a '' is then formula_4 . because these two ratios are equal , this is true : formula_5one way to write this number isformula_6formula_7 is like any number which , when multiplied by itself , makes 5 ( or which number is multiplied ) : formula_8.the golden ratio is an irrational number . if a person tries to write it , it will never stop and never make a pattern , but it will start this way : 1.6180339887 ... an important thing about this number is that a person can subtract 1 from it or divide 1 by it . either way , the number will still keep going and never stop .

the shape of the universe can not be discussed with everyday terms , because all the terms need to be those of einsteinian relativity . the geometry of the universe is therefore not the ordinary euclidean geometry of our everyday lives.according to the special theory of relativity , it is impossible to say whether two distinct events occur at the same time if those events are separated in space . to speak of `` the shape of the universe ( at a point in time ) '' is naive from the point of view of special relativity . due to the relativity of simultaneity we can not speak of different points in space as being `` at the same point in time '' nor , therefore , of `` the shape of the universe at a point in time '' .what astrophysicists do is ask whether a particular model of the universe is consistent with what is known through observations and measurements of the universe . if the observable universe is smaller than the entire universe ( in some models it is many orders of magnitude smaller or even infinitesimal ) , observation is limited to a part of the whole.consideration of the shape of the universe can be split into two : < br > the observable universe is the basis for testing any model of the universe . it is a spherical volume ( a ball ) centered on the observer , regardless of the shape of the universe as a whole . every location in the universe has its own observable universe , which may or may not overlap with the one centered on earth.recent measurements have led nasa to state , `` we now know that the universe is flat with only a 0.4 % margin of error '' . within one model , the flrw model , the present most popular shape of the universe found to fit observational data is the infinite flat model . there are other models that also fit the data .

a virus is a microscopic parasite that can infect living organisms and cause disease . it can make copies of itself inside another organism 's cells . viruses consist of nucleic acid and a protein coat . usually the nucleic acid is rna ; sometimes it is dna . viruses are able to cause many types of diseases , such as polio , ebola and hepatitis . virology is the study of viruses.viruses reproduce by getting their nucleic acid strand into a prokaryote or eukaryote ( cell ) . the rna or dna strand then takes over the cell machinery to reproduce copies of itself and the protein coat . the cell then bursts open , spreading the newly created viruses . all viruses reproduce this way , and there are no free-living viruses . viruses are everywhere in the environment , and all organisms can be infected by them.viruses are so much smaller than bacteria . they were not visible until the invention of the electron microscope . a virus has a simple structure , it has no internal cellular structure , no cell wall or cell membrane , just the protein coat that holds the string of nucleic acid.with eukaryotic cells , the virus protein coat is able to enter the target cells via certain cell membrane receptors . with prokaryote bacteria cells , the bacteriophage physically injects the nucleic acid strand into the host cell.viruses have the following characteristics : when the host cell has finished making more viruses , it undergoes lysis , or breaks apart . the viruses are released and are then able to infect other cells . viruses can remain intact for a long time , and will infect cells when the time and conditions are right.some special viruses are worth noting . bacteriophages have evolved to enter bacterial cells , which have a different type of cell wall from eukaryote cell membranes . `` envelope viruses '' , when they reproduce , cover themselves with a modified form of the host cell membrane , thus gaining an outer lipid layer that helps entry . some of our most difficult-to-combat viruses , like influenza and hiv , use this method.viral infections in animals trigger an immune response which usually kills the infecting virus . vaccines can also produce immune responses . they give an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection . however , some viruses ( including those causing aids and viral hepatitis ) escape from these immune responses and cause chronic infections . antibiotics have no effect on viruses , but there are some other drugs against viruses .

the meissner effect is when a magnetic field is pushed out of a superconductor when it becomes superconducting . if you were to put a superconductor in the field of a big magnet and you looked just inside the superconductor , you would see that the magnetic field was much smaller than it was outside . the deeper in you looked , the closer it would be to zero . this is one of the ways that superconductors are not the same as perfect conductors , which do let magnetic fields pass through them.the effect was discovered by walter meissner and robert ochsenfeld in 1933 . they saw that because the magnetic field can not go through the superconductor , the field right outside the superconductor becomes stronger.one example of the meissner effect is a magnet levitating above a superconducting plate cooled by liquid nitrogen . in order to stop the magnetic field from going into the superconductor , the superconductor acts like a magnet pointing the opposite direction . this repels the real magnet and stops it from coming any closer .

the celts were a large group of caucasian tribes in europe . they first appeared in the early iron age , around 1200 b.c . in austria . the name 'celt ' comes from the greeks . the romans called them `` gauls '' . they came from the hallstatt and la tène cultures . their culture and genes spread through much of europe , and by the time the greeks and later the romans started emerging , the british isles and parts of western , southern and eastern europe were celtic - the most prominent celtic tribes were in gaul . the celts spoke celtic languages . today , the celtic languages that remain are the breton , cornish , welsh and gaelic languages.celtic society and technology , although not as advanced as the romans , was far from being primitive for its time . the celts lived a way of life based on ethical codes and honor codes and had developed a culture of their own , full of unique drawings , sculptures , jewellery , folklore , and building designs and techniques . they were also skilled in blacksmithing , farming and diplomacy.celtic warriors would wear war paint and try to scare their enemies by shouting war cries . tribes had different dress standards for battle ; some warriors wore chainmail and/or leather armor , some wore only clothes and some were known to fight fully naked . they also had their own type of sword that was very strong and a shield that was very protective.when the roman republic started expanding , the gauls and the romans became very hostile towards each other and clashed on many occasions ; however , the romans were eventually able to defeat them and ended up conquering most of the celtic tribes in europe and ruled them until the fall of the western roman empire . celtic tribes also fought among each other . after winning a battle , the celts would cut off the heads of their enemies and take them home.during the fall of the roman empire most of the old celtic land ended up being ruled by migrating germanic tribes and they merged with romano-celtic stock ( people with both roman and celtic ancestry ) to eventually form several european nations of today e.g . portugal , spain , france , belgium , switzerland , luxembourg as well as southern and western germany . territories that are still considered celtic are ireland , wales , scotland , isle of man , cornwall and brittany .
